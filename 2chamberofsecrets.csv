1,CHAPTER ONE,
2,The Worst Birthday,
3,"Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet",
4,"Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud,",
5,hooting noise from his nephew Harry’s room.,
6,"“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t control that owl, it’ll",have
7,to go!”,
8,"Harry tried, yet again, to explain.",
9,"“She’s bored,” he said. “She’s used to flying around outside. If I could just let her out",at
10,night -”,
11,"“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his bushy",
12,mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that owl’s let out.”,
13,"He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.",
14,"Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the",
15,"Dursleys’ son, Dudley.",
16,“I want more bacon.”,
17,"“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her",
18,massive son. “We must build you up while we’ve got the chance… I don’t like the sound,
19,of that school food…”,

24,"“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings,” said Uncle Vernon",
25,"heartily. “Dudley gets enough, don’t you, son?”",
26,"Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair,",
27,grinned and turned to Harry.,
28,“Pass the frying pan.”,
29,"“You’ve forgotten the magic word,” said Harry irritably.",
30,The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible: Dudley,
31,gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Dursley gave,
32,"a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet,",
33,veins throbbing in his temples.,
34,“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean —”,
35,"“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table, “ABOUT",
36,SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR HOUSE?”,
37,“But I —”,
38,"“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with",
39,his fist.,
40,“I just —”,
41,“I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER,
42,THIS ROOF!”,
43,"Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave",
44,Dudley to his feet.,
45,"“All right,” said Harry, “all right…”",
46,"Uncle Vernon sat back down, breathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry",
47,"closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.",

52,"Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been",
53,"treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn’t",
54,"a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was as not normal as it is possible to be.",
55,Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of,
56,Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the,
57,"holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.",
58,He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the,
59,"castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape,",
60,"the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping",
61,"in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his",
62,"cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most",
63,"popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen",
64,players on broomsticks).,
65,"All Harry’s spellbooks, his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two",
66,Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon,
67,the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on,
68,the House Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all summer? What was it to the,
69,Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursleys,
70,"were what wizards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), and as far",
71,"as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame.",
72,"Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry’s owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from",
73,carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world.,
74,"Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless,",
75,with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was,
76,"blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant",
77,"green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his",
78,"forehead was a thin, lightningshaped scar.",
79,"It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was",
80,"the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the",
81,Dursleys’ doorstep eleven years before.,

85,,
86,"At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark",
87,"sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared",
88,"to speak. Harry’s parents had died in Voldemort’s attack, but Harry had escaped with his",
89,"lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why —Voldemort’s powers had",
90,been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.,
91,So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her husband. He had,
92,"spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things",
93,"happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the",
94,car crash that had killed his parents.,
95,"And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had",
96,"come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were",
97,"famous… but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the",
98,"summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.",
99,The Dursleys hadn’t even remembered that today happened to be Harry’s twelfth,
100,"birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn’t been high; they’d never given him a real present,",
101,let alone a cake — but to ignore it completely…,
102,"At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, “Now, as we all",
103,"know, today is a very important day.”",
104,"Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.",
105,"“This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,” said Uncle Vernon.",
106,"Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking",
107,about the stupid dinner party. He’d been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some,
108,rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a,
109,huge order from him (Uncle Vernon’s company made drills).,
110,"“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” said Uncle Vernon. “We",
111,"should all be in position at eight o’clock. Petunia, you will be —?”",
112,"“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting to welcome them graciously to our",
113,home.”,

118,"“Good, good. And Dudley?”",
119,"“I’ll be waiting to open the door.” Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. “May I take",
120,"your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”",
121,“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.,
122,"“Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. “And you?”",
123,"“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” said Harry",
124,tonelessly.,
125,"“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastily. “I will lead them into the lounge, introduce you,",
126,"Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-fifteen —”",
127,"“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia.",
128,"“And, Dudley, you’ll say —”",
129,"“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said Dudley, offering his fat",
130,arm to an invisible woman.,
131,“My perfect little gentleman!” sniffed Aunt Petunia.,
132,“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.,
133,"“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” said Harry dully.",
134,"“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any",
135,ideas?”,
136,"“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason… Do tell me where you bought",
137,"your dress, Mrs. Mason…”",
138,“Perfect… Dudley?”,

143,"“How about —‘We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I",
144,wrote about you.’”,
145,This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and,
146,"hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn’t see him laughing.",
147,"“And you, boy?”",
148,Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.,
149,"“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not there,” he said.",
150,"“Too right, you will.” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Masons don’t know anything",
151,"about you and it’s going to stay that way. When dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason",
152,"back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I’ll bring the subject around to drills. With",
153,"any luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed before the news at ten. Be shopping for a",
154,vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.”,
155,Harry couldn’t feel too excited about this. He didn’t think the Dursleys would like him,
156,any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.,
157,"“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,”",
158,he snarled at Harry. “You stay out of your aunt’s way while she’s cleaning.”,
159,"Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn,",
160,"slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath:",
161,“Happy birthday to me… happy birthday to me…”,
162,"No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist.",
163,He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else,
164,"at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron",
165,"Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn’t seem to be missing him at all.",
166,"Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going",
167,to ask Harry to come and stay.,
168,"Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig’s cage by magic and",
169,"sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk. Underage",

174,wizards weren’t allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the Dursleys,
175,this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that,
176,stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and,
177,"broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense",
178,words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of the room as fast as his fat,
179,legs would carry him. But the long silence from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel,
180,so cut off from the magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and,
181,now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday.,
182,What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From any witch or wizard?,
183,"He’d almost be glad of a sight of his archenemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t",
184,all been a dream…,
185,"Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very end of last term, Harry",
186,had come face-to-face with none other than Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might,
187,"be a ruin of his former self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined t",
188,"regain power. Harry had slipped through Voldemort’s clutches for a second time, but it",
189,"had been a narrow escape, and even now, weeks later, Harry kept waking in the night,",
190,"drenched in cold sweat, wondering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid",
191,"face, his wide, mad eyes —",
192,Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had been staring absent-,
193,mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was staring back. Two enormous green eyes,
194,had appeared among the leaves.,
195,Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the lawn.,
196,"“I know what day it is,” sang Dudley, waddling toward him.",
197,The huge eyes blinked and vanished.,
198,"“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been.",
199,"“I know what day it is,” Dudley repeated, coming right up to him.",
200,"“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ve finally learned the days of the week.”",

205,"“Today’s your birthday,” sneered Dudley. “How come you haven’t got any cards? Haven’t",
206,you even got friends at that freak place?”,
207,"“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” said Harry coolly.",
208,"Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his fat bottom.",
209,“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously.,
210,"“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire,” said Harry.",
211,"Dudley stumbled backward at once, a look of panic on his fat face.",
212,“You c-can’t — Dad told you you’re not to do m-magic — he said he’ll chuck you out of,
213,the house — and you haven’t got anywhere else to go — you haven’t got any friends to,
214,take you —”,
215,“Jiggery pokery!” said Harry in a fierce voice. “Hocus pocus — squiggly wiggly —”,
216,"“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he dashed back toward the",
217,house. “MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!”,
218,Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor the hedge was in any,
219,"way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn’t really done magic, but he still had to duck as she",
220,aimed a heavy blow at his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to,
221,"do, with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished.",
222,"While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, Harry cleaned the windows,",
223,"washed the car, mowed the lawn, trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the",
224,"roses, and repainted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the back of",
225,"his neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s bait, but Dudley had said the",
226,very thing Harry had been thinking himself… maybe he didn’t have any friends at,
227,Hogwarts…,
228,"Wish they could see famous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely as he spread manure",
229,"on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat running down his face.",

234,"It was half past seven in the evening when at last, exhausted, he heard Aunt Petunia",
235,calling him.,
236,“Get in here! And walk on the newspaper!”,
237,Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On top of the fridge stood,
238,tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of whipped cream and sugared violets. A loin of roast,
239,pork was sizzling in the oven.,
240,"“Eat quickly! The Masons will be here soon!” snapped Aunt Petunia, pointing to two",
241,slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the kitchen table. She was already wearing a,
242,salmon-pink cocktail dress.,
243,Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The moment he had,
244,"finished, Aunt Petunia whisked away his plate. “Upstairs! Hurry!”",
245,"As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a glimpse of Uncle Vernon and",
246,Dudley in bow ties and dinner jackets. He had only just reached the upstairs landing,
247,when the door bell rang and Uncle Vernon’s furious face appeared at the foot of the,
248,stairs.,
249,"“Remember, boy — one sound —”",
250,"Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe slipped inside, closed the door, and turned to",
251,"collapse on his bed. The trouble was, there was already someone sitting on it.",

256,CHAPTER TWO,
257,Dobby’s Warning,
258,"Harry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed",
259,"had large, bat-like ears and bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew",
260,instantly that this was what had been watching him out of the garden hedge that,
261,morning.,
262,"As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from the hall.",
263,"“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?”",
264,"The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose",
265,"touched the carpet. Harry noticed that it was wearing what looked like an old pillowcase,",
266,with rips for arm- and leg-holes.,
267,"“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously.",
268,“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry was sure would carry,
269,"down the stairs. “So long has Dobby wanted to meet you, sir… Such an honor it is…”",
270,"“Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along the wall and sinking into his desk chair, next to",
271,"Hedwig, who was asleep in her large cage. He wanted to ask, “What are you?” but",
272,"thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, “Who are you?”",
273,"“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said the creature.",
274,"“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be rude or anything, but — this isn’t a",
275,great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.”,
276,"Aunt Petunias high, false laugh sounded from the living room. The elf hung his head.",

281,"“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry quickly, “but, er, is there any",
282,particular reason you’re here?”,
283,"“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come to tell you, sir… it is difficult, sir",
284,Dobby wonders where to begin…”,
285,"“Sit down,” said Harry politely, pointing at the bed.",
286,"To his horror, the elf burst into tears — very noisy tears.",
287,“S-sit down!” he wailed. “Never… never ever…”,
288,Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter.,
289,"“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you or anything —”",
290,“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard,
291,— like an equal —”,
292,"Harry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the same time, ushered Dobby back",
293,"onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he",
294,"managed to control himself, and sat with his great eyes fixed on Harry in an expression",
295,of watery adoration.,
296,"“You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said Harry, trying to cheer him up.",
297,"Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and started banging his head",
298,"furiously on the window, shouting, “Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!”",
299,"“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, springing up and pulling Dobby back onto",
300,the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a particularly loud screech and was beating her,
301,wings wildly against the bars of her cage.,
302,"“Dobby had to punish himself, sir,” said the elf, who had gone slightly cross-eyed.",
303,"“Dobby almost spoke ill of his family, sir…”",
304,“Your family?”,

309,"“The wizard family Dobby serves, sir… Dobby is a house-elf — bound to serve one",
310,house and one family forever…”,
311,“Do they know you’re here?” asked Harry curiously.,
312,Dobby shuddered.,
313,"“Oh, no, sir, no… Dobby will have to punish himself most grievously for coming to see",
314,"you, sir. Dobby will have to shut his ears in the oven door for this. If they ever knew,",ir
315,—”,
316,“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?”,
317,"“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself for something, sir. They",
318,"lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes they reminds me to do extra punishments…”",
319,“But why don’t you leave? Escape?”,
320,"“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set Dobby free… Dobby will",
321,"serve the family until he dies, sir…”",
322,Harry stared.,
323,"“And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks,” he said. “This makes",
324,the Dursleys sound almost human. Can’t anyone help you? Can’t I?”,
325,"Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. Dobby dissolved again into wails of",
326,gratitude.,
327,"“Please,” Harry whispered frantically, “please be quiet. If the Dursleys hear anything,",f
328,they know you’re here —”,
329,"“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby… Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but of",
330,"your goodness, Dobby never knew…”",

335,"Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, “Whatever you’ve heard about my",
336,"greatness is a load of rubbish. I’m not even top of my year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione,",
337,she —”,
338,"But he stopped quickly, because thinking about Hermione was painful.",
339,"“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, his orb-like eyes aglow.",
340,“Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named —”,
341,“Voldemort?” said Harry.,
342,"Dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, “Ah, speak not the name, sir!",
343,Speak not the name!”,
344,"“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. My friend Ron —”",
345,"He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too.",
346,"Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights.",
347,"“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoarsely, “that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second",
348,time just weeks ago… that Harry Potter escaped yet again.”,
349,Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears.,
350,"“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his face with a corner of the grubby pillowcase he was",
351,wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He has braved so many dangers already! But,
352,"Dobby has come to protect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his",
353,ears in the oven door later… Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts.”,
354,There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks from downstairs and,
355,the distant rumble of Uncle Vernon’s voice.,
356,“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term starts on September first.,
357,It’s all that’s keeping me going. You don’t know what it’s like here. I don’t belong here. I,
358,belong in your world — at Hogwarts.”,

363,"“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shaking his head so hard his ears flapped. “Harry Potter",
364,"must stay where he is safe. He is too great, too good, to lose. If Harry Potter goes back",
365,"to Hogwarts, he will be in mortal danger.”",
366,“Why?” said Harry in surprise.,
367,"“There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible things happen at Hogwarts",
368,"School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year,” whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all",
369,"over. “Dobby has known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in peril. He",
370,"is too important, sir!”",
371,“What terrible things?” said Harry at once. “Who’s plotting them?”,
372,Dobby made a funny choking noise and then banged his head frantically against the,
373,wall.,

519,"The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Petunias hand appeared, pushing a bowl of canned soup",

522,the room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bottom of the bowl,

747,"ground near the entrance read, THE BURROW. Around the front door lay a jumble of",
748,rubber boots and a very rusty cauldron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their,
749,way around the yard.,

792,"who nodded encouragingly, followed her.",
793,The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a scrubbed wooden table and,
794,"chairs in the middle, and Harry sat down on the edge of his seat, looking around. He",
795,had never been in a wizard house before.,
796,The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no numbers at all. Written,
797,"around the edge were things like Time to make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You’re",
798,"late. Books were stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm",
799,"Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute Feasts — It’s Magic! And",
800,"unless Harry’s ears were deceiving him, the old radio next to the sink had just",

807,"“I don’t blame you, dear,” she assured Harry, tipping eight or nine sausages onto his",

824,"nightdress, who appeared in the kitchen, gave a small squeal, and ran out again.",

827,"“Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,” Fred said with a grin, but he caught his",

843,"“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden —”",
844,Harry looked at the cover of Mrs. Weasley’s book. Written across it in fancy gold letters,
845,were the words Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to Household Pests. There was a big,

850,photograph on the front of a very good-looking wizard with wavy blond hair and bright,
851,"blue eyes. As always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the wizard,",
852,"who Harry supposed was Gilderoy Lockhart, kept winking cheekily up at them all. Mrs.",
853,Weasley beamed down at him.,
854,"“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said. “He knows his household pests, all right, it’s a wonderful",
855,book…”,
856,"“Mum fancies him,” said Fred, in a very audible whisper.",
857,"“Don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks rather pink. “All right, if yo",
858,"think you know better than Lockhart, you can go and get on with it, and woe betide you",
859,if there’s a single gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.”,
860,"Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with Harry behind them. The",
861,"garden was large, and in Harry’s eyes, exactly what a garden should be. The Dursleys",
862,"wouldn’t have liked it — there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting —",
863,"but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had never seen spilling",
864,"from every flower bed, and a big green pond full of frogs.",
865,"“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” Harry told Ron they crossed the lawn.",
866,"“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,” said Ron, bent double with his",
867,"head in a peony bush, “like fat little Santa Clauses with fishing rods…”",
868,"There was a violent scuffling noise, the peony bush shuddered, and Ron straightened",
869,"up. “This is a gnome,” he said grimly.",
870,“Gerroff me! Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome.,
871,"It was certainly nothing like Santa Claus. It was small and leathery looking, with a large,",
872,"knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. Ron held it at arm’s length as it kicked out at",
873,him with its horny little feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down.,
874,"“This is what you have to do,” he said. He raised the gnome above his head (“Gerroff",
875,me!”) and started to swing it in great circles like a lasso. Seeing the shocked look on,

881,dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnome holes.”,
882,He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air and landed with a thud,
883,in the field over the hedge.,
884,"“Pitiful,” said Fred. “I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.”",
885,Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He decided just to drop the,
886,"first one he caught over the hedge, but the gnome, sensing weakness, sank its razor-",
887,sharp teeth into Harry’s finger and he had a hard job shaking it off — until —,
888,"“Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet…”",
889,The air was soon thick with flying gnomes.,
890,"“See, they’re not too bright,” said George, seizing five or six gnomes at once. “The",
891,moment they know the de-gnoming’s going on they storm up to have a look. You’d,
892,think they’d have learned by now just to stay put.”,
893,"Soon, the crowd of gnomes in the field started walking away in a straggling line, their",
894,little shoulders hunched.,
895,"“They’ll be back,” said Ron as they watched the gnomes disappear into the hedge on",
896,the other side of the field. “They love it here… Dad’s too soft with them; he thinks they’re,
897,funny…”,
898,"Just then, the front door slammed.",
899,“He’s back!” said George. “Dad’s home!”,
900,They hurried through the garden and back into the house.,
901,Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitchen chair with his glasses off and his eyes closed. He,
902,"was a thin man, going bald, but the little hair he had was as red as any of his children’s.",

911,Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed.,
912,"“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly.",
913,"“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,” yawned Mr. Weasley.",
914,"“There was some pretty nasty stuff that wasn’t my department, though. Mortlake was",
915,"taken away for questioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that’s the Committee",
916,"on Experimental Charms, thank goodness…”",
917,“Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?” said George.,
918,"“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them a key that keeps shrinking to",
919,"nothing so they can never find it when they need it.. Of course, it’s very hard to convict",
920,anyone because no Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking — they’ll insist they,
921,just keep losing it. Bless,
922,"them, they’ll go to any lengths to ignore magic, even if it’s staring them in the face… But",
923,"the things our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn’t believe —”",
924,"“LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?”",
925,"Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. Mr. Weasley’s eyes",
926,jerked open. He stared guiltily at his wife.,

993,CHAPTER FOUR,
994,At Flourish and Blotts,
995,Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys,
996,liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys’ house burst with the strange and,
997,unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen,
998,"mantelpiece and it shouted, “Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!” The ghoul in the attic howled",
999,"and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions",
1000,from Fred and George’s bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found,
1001,"most unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mirror or the clanking",
1002,ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.,
1003,Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth,
1004,helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so,
1005,"that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to",
1006,explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked.,
1007,"“Fascinating.” he would say as Harry talked him through using a telephone. “Ingenious,",
1008,"really, how many ways Muggles have found of getting along without magic.”",
1009,Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the,
1010,Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny,
1011,"already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally",
1012,knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to,
1013,knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to,
1014,retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he,
1015,"hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.",

1024,For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry’s told him to,

1083,high.,
1084,"They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they",

1111,of gold.,
1112,Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen,

1122,things last year?”,
1123,“I went on the Underground —”,
1124,“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there escapators? How exactly —”,

1138,“The right what?” said Harry nervously as the fire roared and whipped George out of,

1169,"Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot, he got gingerly to his feet, holding his broken",

1177,"Even worse, the dark, narrow street Harry could see through the dusty shop window was",

1467,The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being presented with the,
1468,"entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering slightly under their weight, he managed to",
1469,"make his way out of the limelight to the edge of the room, where Ginny was standing",
1470,next to her new cauldron.,
1471,"“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into the cauldron. “I’ll buy",

1474,"“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice Harry had no trouble recognizing.",

1479,"“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the first time she had",
1480,spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Malfoy.,
1481,"“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend!” drawled Malfoy. Ginny went scarlet as Ron and",
1482,"Hermione fought their way over, both clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books.",
1483,"“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were something unpleasant on the",
1484,"sole of his shoe. “Bet you’re surprised to see Harry here, eh?”",
1485,"“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” retorted Malfoy. “I suppose",
1486,your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those.”,
1487,"Ron went as red as Ginny. He dropped his books into the cauldron, too, and started",

1499,"“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy. “All those raids… I hope they’re",

1502,"very old, very battered copy of A Beginner’s Guide to Transfiguration.",

1556,The end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry’s liking. He was looking,
1557,"forward to getting back to Hogwarts, but his month at the Burrow had been the",
1558,happiest of his life. It was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the,
1559,Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he turned up on Privet,
1560,Drive.,
1561,"On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous dinner that included all of",
1562,"Harry’s favorite things, ending with a mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George",
1563,rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the kitchen with,
1564,red and blue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall for at least half an hour. Then it was,
1565,time for a last mug of hot chocolate and bed.,
1566,"It took a long while to get started next morning. They were up at dawn, but somehow",
1567,they still seemed to have a great deal to do. Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood,
1568,"looking for spare socks and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with",
1569,"bits of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, tripping over a stray",
1570,chicken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny’s trunk to the car.,
1571,"Harry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, and a rat were going to",
1572,"fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reckoned, of course, without the special features",
1573,that Mr. Weasley had added.,
1574,"“Not a word to Molly,” he whispered to Harry as he opened the trunk and showed him",
1575,how it had been magically expanded so that the luggage fitted easily.,
1576,"When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into the back seat, where",
1577,"Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all sitting comfortably side by side, and said,",
1578,"“Muggles do know more than we give them credit for, don’t they?” She and Ginny got",
1579,"into the front seat, which had been stretched so that it resembled a park bench. “I mean,",
1580,"you’d never know it was this roomy from the outside, would you?”",
1581,"Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the yard, Harry turning back",
1582,for a last look at the house. He barely had time to wonder when he’d see it again when,
1583,they were back. George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after,

1588,"that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run in for his broomstick. T",ey
1589,had almost reached the highway when Ginny shrieked that she’d left her diary. By the,
1590,"time she had clambered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers",
1591,were running high.,
1592,Mr. Weasley glanced at his watch and then at his wife.,
1593,"“Molly, dear —”",
1594,"“No, Arthur —–”",
1595,“No one would see — this little button here is an Invisibility Booster I installed — tha,’d
1596,get us up in the air — then we fly above the clouds. We’d be there in ten minutes and,
1597,no one would be any the wiser —”,
1598,"“I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight —”",
1599,They reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley dashed across the road to,
1600,get trolleys for their trunks and they all hurried into the station.,
1601,Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The tricky part was getting,
1602,"onto platform nine and three-quarters, which wasn’t visible to the Muggle eye. What",
1603,you had to do was walk through the solid barrier dividing platforms nine and ten. It,
1604,"didn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you",

1606,"“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock overhead, which showed",
1607,they had only five minutes to disappear casually through the barrier.,
1608,Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went next; Fred and George,
1609,followed.,
1610,"“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs. Weasley told Harry and Ron,",
1611,grabbing Ginny’s hand and setting off. In the blink of an eye they were gone.,
1612,"“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” Ron said to Harry.",

1617,Harry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely wedged on top of his trunk and wheeled,
1618,his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt perfectly confident; this wasn’t nearly as,
1619,uncomfortable as using Floo powder. Both of them bent low over the handles of their,
1620,"trolleys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A few feet away",
1621,"from it, they broke into a run and —",
1622,CRASH.,
1623,Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron’s trunk fell off with a loud,
1624,"thump, Harry was knocked off his feet, and Hedwig’s cage bounced onto the shiny floor,",
1625,"and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard",
1626,"nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?”",
1627,"“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as he got up. Ron ran to",
1628,"pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of muttering about",
1629,cruelty to animals from the surrounding crowd.,
1630,“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron.,
1631,“I dunno —”,
1632,Ron looked wildly around. A dozen curious people were still watching them.,
1633,"“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I don’t understand why the gateway’s",
1634,sealed itself —”,
1635,Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. Ten,
1636,seconds… nine seconds…,
1637,He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right against the barrier and,
1638,pushed with all his might. The metal remained solid.,
1639,Three seconds… two seconds… one second…,
1640,"“It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned. “The train’s left. What if Mum and Dad can’t get",
1641,back through to us? Have you got any Muggle money?”,

1647,six years.”,
1648,Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier.,
1649,"“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tensely, “What’re we going to do? I don’t know how long",
1650,it’ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.”,
1651,"They looked around. People were still watching them, mainly because of Hedwig’s",

1656,“What about it?”,

1662,"“But your Mum and Dad…” said Harry, pushing against the barrier again in the vain",
1663,hope that it would give way. “How will they get home?”,
1664,“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know how to Apparate! You,
1665,"know, just vanish and reappear at home! They only bother with Floo powder and the car",
1666,because we’re all underage and we’re not allowed to Apparate yet…”,

1675,"And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, out of the station and",
1676,back onto the side road where the old Ford Anglia was parked.,
1677,Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk with a series of taps from his wand. They heaved,
1678,"their luggage back in, put Hedwig on the back seat, and got into the front.",
1679,"“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, starting the ignition with another tap of his",
1680,wand. Harry stuck his head out of the window: Traffic was rumbling along the main road,
1681,"ahead, but their street was empty.",
1682,"“Okay,” he said.",
1683,Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car around them vanished —,
1684,"and so did they. Harry could feel the seat vibrating beneath him, hear the engine, feel",
1685,"his hands on his knees and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had",
1686,"become a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full o",

1692,"“Uh-oh,” said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. “It’s faulty —”",
1693,Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered back again.,
1694,"“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the accelerator; they shot straight",

1710,"And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst out into a blaze of",
1711,sunlight.,
1712,"It was a different world. The wheels of the car skimmed the sea of fluffy cloud, the sky",a
1713,"bright, endless blue under the blinding white sun.",

1715,"They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, they couldn’t stop.",

1733,stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes now and was thinking longingly of the train,
1734,"miles below, where you could buy ice-cold pumpkin juice from a trolley pushed by a",

1806,"branch as thick as a battering ram was pounding furiously on the roof, which seemed to",
1807,be caving in.,
1808,"“Run for it!” Ron shouted, throwing his full weight against his door, but next second he",
1809,had been knocked backward into Harry’s lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch.,
1810,"“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly the floor of the car",
1811,was vibrating — the engine had restarted.,
1812,"“Reverse!” Harry yelled, and the car shot backward; the tree was still trying to hit them;",
1813,"they could hear its roots creaking as it almost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as",
1814,they sped out of reach.,

1820,"The car, however, had reached the end of its tether. With two sharp clunks, the doors",
1821,flew open and Harry felt his seat tip sideways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on,
1822,the damp ground. Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from the,
1823,trunk; Hedwig’s cage flew through the air and burst open; she rose out of it with an,
1824,"angry screech and sped off toward the castle without a backward look. Then, dented,",
1825,"scratched, and steaming, the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear lights blazing",
1826,angrily.,
1827,"“Come back!” Ron yelled after it, brandishing his broken wand. “Dad’ll kill me!”",
1828,But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its exhaust.,
1829,"“Can you believe our luck?” said Ron miserably, bending down to pick up Scabbers. “Of",
1830,"all the trees we could’ve hit, we had to get one that hits back.”",
1831,"He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still flailing its branches",
1832,threateningly.,
1833,"“Come on,” said Harry wearily, “we’d better get up to the school…”",
1834,"It wasn’t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, cold, and bruised, they",
1835,"seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy slope, toward",
1836,the great oak front doors.,
1837,"“I think the feast’s already started,” said Ron, dropping his trunk at the foot of the front",

1848,"Through the forest of pointed black Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a long line of scared-",

1852,newcomers.,
1853,"Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted new students into the",

1859,"and the rest of the Weasleys. Last term, Harry and",
1860,"Ron had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating Slytherin for the first",

1862,"A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place the hat on his head.",
1863,"Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Professor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat",
1864,"watching the Sorting from the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses",
1865,"shining brightly in the candlelight. Several seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy Lockhart,",
1866,"dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was Hagrid, huge and hairy,",
1867,drinking deeply from his goblet.,
1868,“Hang on…” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an empty chair at the staff table… Where’s,

1890,"the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was lit with flaming torches. A delicious smell of",

1892,"light, down a narrow stone staircase that led into the dungeons.",
1893,"“In!” he said, opening a door halfway down the cold passageway and pointing.",

1897,door and turned to look at them.,

1899,"faithful sidekick Weasley. Wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?”",
1900,"“No, sir, it was the barrier at King’s Cross, it —”",
1901,“Silence!” said Snape coldly. “What have you done with the car?” Ron gulped. This,
1902,wasn’t the first time Snape had given Harry the impression of being able to read minds.,
1903,"But a moment later, he understood, as Snape unrolled today’s issue of the Evening",

1916,larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. Weasley had bewitched the car… he hadn’t,
1917,thought of that…,
1918,"“I noticed, in my search of the park, that considerable damage seems to have been done",

1923,that happy power. You will wait here.”,
1924,"Harry and Ron stared at each other, white-faced. Harry didn’t feel hungry any more. He",

1927,"McGonagall, head of Gryffindor House, they were hardly any better off. She might be",

1929,"Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Professor McGonagall who",

2157,double Herbology with the Hufflepuffs first.,
2158,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the vegetable patch, and",
2159,"made for the greenhouses, where the magical plants were kept. At least the Howler had",

2165,Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough and was being,
2166,perfectly friendly again.,
2167,"As they neared the greenhouses they saw the rest of the class standing outside, waiting",
2168,"for Professor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had only just joined them when she",
2169,"came striding into view across the lawn, accompanied by Gilderoy Lockhart. Professor",
2170,"Sprout’s arms were full of bandages, and with another twinge of guilt, Harry spotted the",
2171,"Whomping Willow in the distance, several of its branches now in slings.",
2172,Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat over her flyaway hair;,
2173,there was usually a large amount of earth on her clothes and her fingernails would have,
2174,"made Aunt Petunia faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping robes",
2175,"of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly positioned turquoise hat with",
2176,gold trimming.,
2177,"“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the assembled students. “Just been",
2178,showing Professor Sprout the right way to doctor a Whomping Willow! But I don’t want,
2179,you running away with the idea that I’m better at Herbology than she is! I just happen to,
2180,have met several of these exotic plants on my travels…”,
2181,"“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor Sprout, who was looking distinctly",
2182,"disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self.",
2183,There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in greenhouse one before,
2184,— greenhouse three housed far more interesting and dangerous plants. Professor,
2185,Sprout took a large key from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of,
2186,"damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, umbrella-",
2187,sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to follow Ron and Hermione,
2188,inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out.,
2189,"“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if he’s a couple of minutes late, do",
2190,"you, Professor Sprout?”",
2191,"Judging by Professor Sprout’s scowl, she did mind, but Lockhart said, “That’s the ticket,”",
2192,and closed the greenhouse door in her face.,

2197,"“Harry,” said Lockhart, his large white teeth gleaming in the sunlight as he shook his",
2198,"head. “Harry, Harry, Harry.”",
2199,"Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing.",
2200,"“When I heard — well, of course, it was all my fault. Could have kicked myself.”",
2201,Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to say so when Lockhart,
2202,"went on, “Don’t know when I’ve been more shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of",
2203,"course, I knew at once why you’d done it. Stood out a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry.”",
2204,It was remarkable how he could show every one of those brilliant teeth even when he,
2205,wasn’t talking.,
2206,"“Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said Lockhart. “Gave you the bug. You got ont",

2208,"“Oh, no, Professor, see —”",
2209,"“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, reaching out and grasping his shoulder. “I",
2210,understand. Natural to want a bit more once you’ve had that first taste — and I blame,
2211,"myself for giving you that, because it was bound to go to your head — but see here,",
2212,"young man, you can’t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm down, a",l

2214,"‘It’s all right for him, he’s an internationally famous wizard already!’ But when I was",
2215,"twelve, I was just as much of a nobody as you are now. In fact, I’d say I was even more o",
2216,"a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t they? All that business with",
2217,He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” He glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead. “I,
2218,"know, I know — it’s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly’s Most Charming Smile",
2219,"Award five times in a row, as I have — but it’s a start, Harry, it’s a start.”",
2220,"He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood stunned for a few seconds,",
2221,"then, remembering he was supposed to be in the greenhouse, he opened the door and",
2222,slid inside.,
2223,Professor Sprout was standing behind a trestle bench in the center of the greenhouse.,
2224,About twenty pairs of different-colored ear muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry,

2230,"Mandrakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Mandrake?”",
2231,"To nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into the air.",
2232,"“Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Hermione, sounding as usual",
2233,as though she had swallowed the textbook. “It is used to return people who have been,
2234,transfigured or cursed to their original state.”,
2235,"“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor Sprout. “The Mandrake forms an",
2236,"essential part of most antidotes. It is also, however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?”",
2237,Hermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as it shot up again.,
2238,"“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,” she said promptly.",
2239,"“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor Sprout. “Now, the Mandrakes we",
2240,have here are still very young.”,
2241,"She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone shuffled forward for a",
2242,"better look. A hundred or so tufty little plants, purplish green in color, were growing",
2243,"there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Harry, who didn’t have the slightest",
2244,idea what Hermione meant by,
2245,the “cry” of the Mandrake.,
2246,"“Everyone take a pair of earmuffs,” said Professor Sprout.",
2247,There was a scramble as everyone tried to seize a pair that wasn’t pink and fluffy.,
2248,"“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are completely covered,” said",
2249,"Professor Sprout. “When it is safe to remove them, I will give you the thumbs-up. Right",
2250,— earmuffs on.”,
2251,Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound completely. Professor,

2258,Harry let out a gasp of surprise that no one could hear.,
2259,"Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby popped out of the earth. The",
2260,"leaves were growing right out of his head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was",
2261,clearly bawling at the top of his lungs.,
2262,Professor Sprout took a large plant pot from under the table and plunged the Mandrake,
2263,"into it, burying him in dark, damp compost until only the tufted leaves were visible.",
2264,"Professor Sprout dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed her",
2265,own earmuffs.,
2266,"“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” she said calmly as",
2267,"though she’d just done nothing more exciting than water a begonia. “However, they will",
2268,"knock you out for several hours, and as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first day",
2269,"back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you work. I will attract your",

2273,"She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, making it draw in the long",
2274,feelers that had been inching sneakily over her shoulder.,
2275,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a curly-haired Hufflepuff boy",
2276,Harry knew by sight but had never spoken to.,
2277,"“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the hand. “Know who you are,",
2278,"of course, the famous Harry Potter… And you’re Hermione Granger — always top in",
2279,everything” (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) “— and Ron Weasley.,
2280,Wasn’t that your flying car?”,

2293,wizard in the family…”,
2294,After that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs were back on and they,
2295,needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. Professor Sprout had made it look extremely,
2296,"easy, but it wasn’t. The Mandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but didn’t seem",
2297,"to want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their sharp little fists,",nd
2298,gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole minutes trying to squash a particularly fat,
2299,one into a pot.,
2300,"By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, aching, and covered in",
2301,earth. Everyone traipsed back to the castle for a quick wash and then the Gryffindors,
2302,hurried off to Transfiguration.,
2303,"Professor McGonagall’s classes were always hard work, but today was especially difficult.",
2304,Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the,
2305,"summer. He was supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed to",
2306,do was give his beetle a lot of exercise as it scuttled over the desktop avoiding his wand.,
2307,Ron was having far worse problems. He had patched up his wand with some borrowed,
2308,"Spellotape, but it seemed to be damaged beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking",
2309,"at odd moments, and every time Ron tried to transfigure his beetle it engulfed him in",
2310,"thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what he was doing, Ron",
2311,accidentally squashed his beetle with his elbow and had to ask for a new one. Professor,
2312,McGonagall wasn’t pleased.,
2313,Harry was relieved to hear the lunch bell. His brain felt like a wrung sponge. Everyone,
2314,"filed out of the classroom except him and Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on",
2315,the desk.,
2316,“Stupid — useless — thing —”,
2317,"“Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the wand let off a volley of bangs like",
2318,a firecracker.,

2330,"“Why,” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have you outlined all Lockhart’s lessons in",
2331,little hearts?”,
2332,"Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously.",
2333,They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast courtyard. Hermione sat down,
2334,on a stone step and buried her nose in Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ron,
2335,stood talking about Quidditch for several minutes before Harry became aware that he,
2336,"was being closely watched. Looking up, he saw the very small, mousy-haired boy he’d",
2337,seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was,
2338,"clutching what looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry looked at",

2390,"Pinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with humiliation, Harry saw Malfoy slide smirking",

2504,"“Come on now — round them up, round them up, they’re only pixies,” Lockhart",
2505,shouted.,
2506,"He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, “Peskipiksi Pesternomi!”",
2507,It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and threw it out of the,
2508,"window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being",
2509,"squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the chandelier gave way.",
2510,The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the relative calm that,
2511,"followed, Lockhart straightened up, caught sight of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, who were",
2512,"almost at the door, and said, “Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them bac",
2513,into their cage.” He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind him.,
2514,“Can you believe him?” roared Ron as one of the remaining pixies bit him painfully on,
2515,the ear.,
2516,"“He just wants to give us some hands-on experience,” said Hermione, immobilizing two",
2517,pixies at once with a clever Freezing Charm and stuffing them back into their cage.,
2518,"“Hands on? “said Harry, who was trying to grab a pixie dancing out of reach with its",

2529,Mudbloods and Murmurs,
2530,Harry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging out of sight whenever he saw,
2531,"Gilderoy Lockhart coming down a corridor. Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who",
2532,seemed to have memorized Harry’s schedule. Nothing seemed to give Colin a bigger,
2533,"thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or seven times a day and hear, “Hello, Colin,",
2534,"back, however exasperated Harry sounded when he said it.",
2535,Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disastrous car journey and Ron’s wand was,
2536,"still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron’s hand",
2537,"in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a",
2538,"large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry",
2539,"was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit",
2540,"Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier",
2541,"than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.",
2542,“Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily.,
2543,“Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!”,
2544,Harry squinted at the window. There was a thin mist hanging across the pink-and-gold,
2545,"sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn’t understand how he could have slept through",
2546,the racket the birds were making.,
2547,"“Oliver,” Harry croaked. “It’s the crack of dawn.”",
2548,"“Exactly,” said Wood. He was a tall and burly sixth year and, at the moment, his eyes",
2549,were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. “It’s part of our new training program. Come,
2550,"on, grab your broom, and let’s go,” said Wood heartily. “None of the other teams have",
2551,started training yet; we’re going to be first off the mark this year —”,
2552,"Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and tried to find his Quidditch",
2553,robes.,

2558,"“Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in fifteen minutes.”",
2559,"When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak for warmth, Harry",
2560,scribbled a note to Ron explaining where he’d gone and went down the spiral staircase,
2561,"to the common room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just reached",
2562,the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing,
2563,"down the spiral staircase, his camera swinging madly around his neck and something",
2564,clutched in his hand.,
2565,"“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look what I’ve got here! I’ve",
2566,"had it developed, I wanted to show you —”",
2567,Harry looked bemusedly at the photograph Colin was brandishing under his nose.,
2568,"A moving, black-and-white Lockhart was tugging hard on an arm Harry recognized as",
2569,his own. He was pleased to see that his photographic self was putting up a good fight,
2570,"and refusing to be dragged into view. As Harry watched, Lockhart gave up and slumped,",
2571,"Panting, against the white edge of the picture.",
2572,“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly.,
2573,"“No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room was really deserted.",
2574,"“Sorry, Colin, I’m in a hurry — Quidditch practice —”",
2575,He climbed through the portrait hole.,
2576,"“Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch game before!”",
2577,Colin scrambled through the hole after him.,
2578,"“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored him, his face shining with",
2579,excitement.,
2580,"“You were the youngest House player in a hundred years, weren’t you, Harry? Weren’t",
2581,"you?” said Colin, trotting alongside him. “You must be brilliant. I’ve never flown. Is it",
2582,easy? Is that your own broom? Is that the best one there is?”,

2587,Harry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an extremely talkative,
2588,shadow.,
2589,"“I don’t really understand Quidditch,” said Colin breathlessly. “Is it true there are fou",
2590,balls? And two of them fly around trying to knock people off their brooms?”,
2591,"“Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch.",
2592,“They’re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat,
2593,the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.”,
2594,"“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, tripping down a couple of steps because",
2595,he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry.,
2596,"“Well, the Quaffle — that’s the biggish red one — is the one that scores goals. Three",
2597,Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through the,
2598,goal posts at the end of the pitch — they’re three long poles with hoops on the end.”,
2599,“And the fourth ball —”,
2600,"“— is the Golden Snitch,” said Harry, “and it’s very small, very fast, and difficult to c",tch.
2601,"But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, because a game of Quidditch doesn’t end until",
2602,the Snitch has been caught. And whichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team,
2603,an extra hundred and fifty points.”,
2604,"“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said Colin in awe.",
2605,"“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started across the dew-drenched grass. “And",
2606,"there’s the Keeper, too. He guards the goal posts. That’s it, really.”",
2607,But Colin didn’t stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the,
2608,"Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms;",
2609,"Colin called after him in a piping voice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Harry!” and hurri",d
2610,off to the stands.,
2611,The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only,
2612,"person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and",
2613,"touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against",

2618,"the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning",
2619,side by side opposite them.,
2620,"“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood briskly. “Now, I wanted a quick talk",
2621,"with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising",
2622,"whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference…”",
2623,"Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many",
2624,"lines, arrows, and crosses in different colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the",
2625,"board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood",
2626,"launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley’s head drooped right onto",
2627,Alicia Spinnet’s shoulder and he began to snore.,
2628,"The first board took nearly twenty minutes to explain, but there was another board",
2629,"under that, and a third under that one. Harry sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and",
2630,on.,
2631,"“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fantasy about what he could",
2632,be eating for breakfast at this very moment up at the castle. “Is that clear? Any,
2633,questions?”,
2634,"“I’ve got a question, Oliver,” said George, who had woken with a start. “Why couldn’t",
2635,you have told us all this yesterday when we were awake?”,
2636,Wood wasn’t pleased.,
2637,"“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them all. “We should have won the",
2638,Quidditch cup last year. We’re easily the best team. But unfortunately — owing to,
2639,circumstances beyond our control —”,
2640,Harry shifted guiltily in his seat. He had been unconscious in the hospital wing for the,
2641,"final match of the previous year, meaning that Gryffindor had been a player short and",
2642,had suffered their worst defeat in three hundred years.,
2643,Wood took a moment to regain control of himself. Their last defeat was clearly still,
2644,torturing him.,

2649,"“So this year, we train harder than ever before… Okay, let’s go and put our new theories",
2650,"into practice!” Wood shouted, seizing his broomstick and leading the way out of the",
2651,"locker rooms. Stiff-legged and still yawning, his team followed.",
2652,"They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now,",
2653,although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the,
2654,"field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.",
2655,“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously.,
2656,"“Haven’t even started,” said Harry, looking jealously at the toast and marmalade Ron",
2657,and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s been teaching us new,
2658,moves.”,
2659,"He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring up into the air. The cool",
2660,"morning air whipped his face, waking him far more effectively than Wood’s long talk. It",
2661,felt wonderful to be back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at,
2662,"full speed, racing Fred and George.",
2663,“What’s that funny clicking noise?” called Fred as they hurtled around the corner.,
2664,"Harry looked into the stands. Colin was sitting in one of the highest seats, his camera",
2665,"raised, taking picture after picture, the sound strangely magnified in the deserted",
2666,stadium.,
2667,"“Look this way, Harry! This way!” he cried shrilly.",
2668,“Who’s that?” said Fred.,
2669,"“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him as far away as possible",
2670,from Colin.,
2671,"“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed through the air toward them.",
2672,"“Why’s that first year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a Slytherin spy, trying",to
2673,find out about our new training program.”,

2680,“What makes you say that?” said Wood testily.,
2681,"“Because they’re here in person,” said George, pointing.",
2682,"Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, broomsticks in their hands.",
2683,“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked the field for today! We’ll see,
2684,about this!”,
2685,"Wood shot toward the ground, landing rather harder than he meant to in his anger,",
2686,"staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, Fred, and George followed.",
2687,“Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Slytherin Captain. “This is our practice time! We got up,
2688,specially! You can clear off now!”,
2689,Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of trollish cunning on his face as,
2690,"he replied, “Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.”",
2691,"Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no girls on the Slytherin",
2692,"team, who stood shoulder to shoulder, facing the Gryffindors, leering to a man.",
2693,"“But I booked the field!” said Wood, positively spitting with rage. “I booked it!”",
2694,"“Ah,” said Flint. “But I’ve got a specially signed note here from Professor Snape. ‘I,",
2695,"Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team permission to practice today on the Quidditch",
2696,field owing to the need to train their new Seeker’. ”,
2697,"“You’ve got a new Seeker?” said Wood, distracted. “Where?”",
2698,"And from behind the six large figures before them came a seventh, smaller boy,",
2699,"smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was Draco Malfoy.",
2700,"“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, looking at Malfoy with dislike.",

2705,"“Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint as the whole Slytherin team",
2706,smiled still more broadly. “Let me show you the generous gift he’s made to the Slytherin,
2707,team.”,
2708,"All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly polished, brand-new handles",
2709,and seven sets of fine gold lettering spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One,
2710,gleamed under the Gryffindors’ noses in the early morning sun.,
2711,"“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said Flint carelessly, flicking a speck of",
2712,dust from the end of his own. “I believe it outstrips the old Two Thousand series by a,
2713,considerable amount. As for the old Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Fred and,
2714,"George, who were both clutching Cleansweep Fives —“ sweeps the board with them.”",
2715,None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for a moment. Malfoy was,
2716,smirking so broadly his cold eyes were reduced to slits.,
2717,"“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.”",
2718,Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to see what was going on.,
2719,“What’s happening?” Ron asked Harry. “Why aren’t you playing? And what’s he doing,
2720,here?”,
2721,"He was looking at Malfoy, taking in his Slytherin Quidditch robes.",
2722,"“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy, smugly. “Everyone’s just been",
2723,admiring the brooms my father’s bought our team.,
2724,"Ron gaped, open-mouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in front of him.",
2725,"“Good, aren’t they?” said Malfoy smoothly. “But perhaps the Gryffindor team will be able",
2726,"to raise some gold and get new brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleansweep",
2727,Fives; I expect a museum would bid for them.”,

2736,"“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” he spat.",
2737,Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad because there was an,
2738,instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George,
2739,"jumping on him, Alicia shrieked, “How dare you!” and Ron plunged his hand into his",
2740,"robes, pulled out his wand, yelling, “You’ll pay for that one, Malfoy!” and pointed it",
2741,furiously under Flint’s arm at Malfoys face.,
2742,A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light shot out of the wrong,
2743,"end of Ron’s wand, hitting him in the stomach and sending him reeling backward onto",
2744,the grass.,
2745,“Ron! Ron! Are you all right?” squealed Hermione.,
2746,"Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead he gave an almighty",
2747,belch and several slugs dribbled out of his mouth onto his lap.,
2748,"The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was doubled up, hanging onto his",
2749,"new broomstick for support. Malfoy was on all fours, banging the ground with his fist.",
2750,"The Gryffindors were gathered around Ron, who kept belching large, glistening slugs.",
2751,Nobody seemed to want to touch him.,

2753,"bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron up by the arms.",
2754,"“What happened, Harry? What happened? Is he ill? But you can cure him, can’t you?”",
2755,Colin had run down from his seat and was now dancing alongside them as they left the,

2766,all right in a minute — almost there —”,
2767,"They were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when the front door opened, but it",
2768,"wasn’t Hagrid who emerged. Gilderoy Lockhart, wearing robes of palest mauve today,",

2770,"“Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a nearby bush. Hermione",
2771,"followed, somewhat reluctantly.",
2772,“It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” Lockhart was saying loudly to,

2775,good-bye!” And he strode away toward the castle.,

2867,In the small vegetable patch behind Hagrid’s house were a dozen of the largest,
2868,pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder.,
2869,"“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily. “Fer the Halloween feast… should be",

2985,The Deathday Party,
2986,"October arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam",
2987,"Pomfrey, the nurse, was kept busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and",
2988,"students. Her Pepperup potion worked instantly, though it left the drinker smoking at",
2989,"the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had been looking pale, was",
2990,bullied into taking some by Percy. The steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the,
2991,impression that her whole head was on fire. Raindrops the size of bullets thundered on,
2992,"the castle windows for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy",
2993,"streams, and Hagrid’s pumpkins swelled to the size of garden sheds. Oliver Wood’s",
2994,"enthusiasm for regular training sessions, however, was not dampened, which was why",
2995,"Harry was to be found, late one stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before",
2996,"Halloween, returning to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to the skin and splattered with mud.",
2997,Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a happy practice session. Fred and,
2998,"George, who had been spying on the Slytherin team, had seen for themselves the speed",
2999,of those new Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones. They reported that the Slytherin team,
3000,"was no more than seven greenish blurs, shooting through the air like missiles. As Harry",
3001,squelched along the deserted corridor he came across somebody who looked just as,
3002,"preoccupied as he was. Nearly Headless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring",
3003,"morosely out of a window, muttering under his breath, “… don’t fulfill their",
3004,"requirements… half an inch, if that…”",
3005,"“Hello, Nick,” said Harry.",
3006,"“Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking round. He wore a dashing,",
3007,"plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that",
3008,"his neck was almost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see",
3009,right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside.,
3010,"“You look troubled, young Potter,” said Nick, folding a transparent letter as he spoke",
3011,and tucking it inside his doublet.,
3012,"“So do you,” said Harry.",
3013,"“Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a matter of no importance… It’s not",
3014,"as though I really wanted to join… Thought I’d apply, but apparently I ‘don’t fulfill",
3015,requirements’,

3021,"In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on his face.",
3022,"“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted suddenly, pulling the letter back out of",
3023,"his pocket, “that getting hit forty-five times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify",
3024,you to join the Headless Hunt?”,
3025,"“Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree.",
3026,"“I mean, nobody wishes more than I do that it had all been quick and clean, and my",
3027,"head had come off properly, I mean, it would have saved me a great deal of pain and",
3028,ridicule. However—” Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously:,
3029,“‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have parted company with their bodies. You,
3030,will appreciate that it would be impossible otherwise for members to participate in hunt,
3031,"activities such as Horseback Head-Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret,",
3032,"therefore, that I must inform you that you do not fulfill our requirements. With very best",

3034,"Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away.",
3035,"“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! Most people would think",
3036,"that’s good and beheaded, but oh, no, it’s not enough for Sir Properly Decapitated-",

3038,"Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in a far calmer tone, “So",
3039,— what’s bothering you? Anything I can do?”,
3040,"“No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can get seven free Nimbus Two",
3041,Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly—”,
3042,The rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched mewling from,
3043,somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and found himself gazing into a pair of,
3044,"lamp-like yellow eyes. It was Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the",
3045,"caretaker, Argus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students.",

3050,"“You’d better get out of here, Harry,” said Nick quickly. “Filch isn’t in a good mood —",
3051,he’s got the flu and some third years accidentally plastered frog brains all over the,
3052,"ceiling in dungeon five. He’s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud",
3053,all over the place —”,
3054,"“Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. Norris, but not quickl",
3055,enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysterious power that seemed to connect him with,
3056,"his foul cat, Argus Filch burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s right, wheezing an",
3057,looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around,
3058,"his head, and his nose was unusually purple.",
3059,"“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, his eyes popping alarmingly as he pointed at the",
3060,muddy puddle that had dripped from Harry’s Quidditch robes. “Mess and muck,
3061,"everywhere! I’ve had enough of it, I tell you! Follow me, Potter!”",
3062,So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and followed Filch back,
3063,"downstairs, doubling the number of muddy footprints on the floor. Harry had never",
3064,been inside Filch’s office before; it was a place most students avoided. The room was,
3065,"dingy and windowless, lit by a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint sme",l
3066,of fried fish lingered about,
3067,"the place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around the walls; from their labels, Harry could",
3068,see that they contained details of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George,
3069,Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished collection of chains and,
3070,manacles hung on the wall behind Filch’s desk. It was common knowledge that he was,
3071,always begging Dumbledore to let him suspend students by their ankles from the,
3072,ceiling.,
3073,Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling around looking for,
3074,parchment.,
3075,"“Dung,” he muttered furiously, “great sizzling dragon bogies… frog brains… rat",
3076,intestines… I’ve had enough of it… make an example… where’s the form… yes…”,
3077,He retrieved a large roll of parchment from his desk drawer and stretched it out in front,

3084,“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry.,
3085,"“It’s only a bit of mud to you, boy, but to me it’s an extra hour scrubbing!” shouted Filch",
3086,a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “Crime… befouling the,
3087,castle… suggested sentence…”,
3088,"Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at Harry who waited with",
3089,bated breath for his sentence to fall.,
3090,"But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the ceiling of the office, which",
3091,made the oil lamp rattle.,
3092,"“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of rage. “I’ll have you this",
3093,"time, I’ll have you!”",
3094,"And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed from the office, Mrs.",
3095,Norris streaking alongside him.,
3096,"Peeves was the school poltergeist, a grinning, airborne menace who lived to cause",
3097,"havoc and distress. Harry didn’t much like Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling grateful for",
3098,"his timing. Hopefully, whatever Peeves had done (and it sounded as though he’d",
3099,wrecked something very big this time) would distract Filch from Harry.,
3100,"Thinking that he should probably wait for Filch to come back, Harry sank into a moth-",
3101,eaten chair next to the desk. There was only one thing on it apart from his half-,
3102,"completed form: a large, glossy, purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With",

3204,"mouth, and its escape into the fire, with accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and",
3205,the Kwikspell envelope from Harry’s mind.,
3206,"By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash promise to go to the",
3207,deathday party. The rest of the school was happily anticipating their Halloween feast;,
3208,"the Great Hall had been decorated with the usual live bats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had",
3209,"been carved into lanterns large enough for three men to sit in, and there were rumors",
3210,that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of dancing skeletons for the entertainment.,
3211,"“A promise is a promise,” Hermione reminded Harry bossily. “You said you’d go to the",
3212,deathday party.”,
3213,"So at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight past the doorway to the",
3214,"packed Great Hall, which was glittering invitingly with gold plates and candles, and",
3215,directed their steps instead toward the dungeons.,
3216,"The passageway leading to Nearly Headless Nick’s party had been lined with candles,",
3217,"too, though the effect was far from cheerful: These were long, thin, jet-black tapers, all",
3218,"burning bright blue, casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The",
3219,temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered and drew his robes,
3220,"tightly around him, he heard what sounded like a thousand fingernails scraping an",
3221,enormous blackboard.,
3222,“Is that supposed to be music?” Ron whispered. They turned a corner and saw Nearly,
3223,Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung with black velvet drapes.,
3224,"“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, welcome… so pleased you could",
3225,come…”,
3226,He swept off his plumed hat and bowed them inside.,

3231,"It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of pearly-white, translucent",
3232,"people, mostly drifting around a crowded dance floor, waltzing to the dreadful,",
3233,"quavering sound of thirty musical saws, played by an orchestra on a raised, black-",
3234,draped platform. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thousand more,
3235,black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; it was like stepping into a freezer.,
3236,"“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested, wanting to warm up his feet.",
3237,"“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron nervously, and they set off around the",
3238,"edge of the dance floor. They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing",
3239,"chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an",
3240,"arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn’t surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a",

3567,"“I know it’s weird,” said Harry. “The whole thing’s weird. What was that writing on the",
3568,wall about? The Chamber Has Been Opened… What’s that supposed to mean?”,
3569,"“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I think someone told me a story",
3570,about a secret chamber at Hogwarts once… might’ve been Bill…”,
3571,“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry.,
3572,"To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger.",
3573,"“Well — it’s not funny really — but as it’s Filch,” he said. “A Squib is someone who was",
3574,born into a wizarding family but hasn’t got any magic powers. Kind of the opposite of,
3575,"Muggle-born wizards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch’s trying to learn magic from",
3576,"a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would explain a lot. Like why he hates",
3577,students so much.” Ron gave a satisfied smile. “He’s bitter.”,
3578,A clock chimed somewhere.,
3579,"“Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before Snape comes along and tries to",
3580,frame us for something else.”,

3582,"it fresh in everyone’s minds by pacing the spot where she had been attacked, as though",
3583,he thought the attacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the message,
3584,"on the wall with Mrs. Skower’s All-Purpose Magical Mess Remover, but to no effect; the",
3585,words still gleamed as brightly as ever on the stone. When Filch wasn’t guarding the,
3586,"scene of the crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out at",
3587,unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for things like “breathing,
3588,loudly’ and “looking happy.”,

3593,"Ginny Weasley seemed very disturbed by Mrs. Norris’s fate. According to Ron, she was a",
3594,great cat lover.,
3595,"“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron told her bracingly. “Honestly, we’r",
3596,much better off without her.” Ginny’s lip trembled. “Stuff like this doesn’t often happen,
3597,"at Hogwarts,” Ron assured her. “They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have him out of",
3598,here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify Filch before he’s expelled. I’m only,
3599,joking —” Ron added hastily as Ginny blanched.,
3600,The attack had also had an effect on Hermione. It was quite usual for Hermione to,
3601,"spend a lot of time reading, but she was now doing almost nothing else. Nor could",
3602,"Harry and Ron get much response from her when they asked what she was up to, and",
3603,not until the following Wednesday did they find out.,
3604,"Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made him stay behind to scrape",
3605,"tubeworms off the desks. After a hurried lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the",
3606,"library, and saw Justin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepuff boy from Herbology, coming",
3607,toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when Justin caught sight of,
3608,"him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the opposite direction.",
3609,"Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his History of Magic homework.",
3610,Professor Binns had asked for a three foot long composition on “The Medieval Assembly,
3611,of European Wizards.”,
3612,"“I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short said Ron furiously, letting go of his",

3625,making his writing as large as possible. “All that junk about Lockhart being so great —”,
3626,Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked irritable and at last,
3627,seemed ready to talk to them.,
3628,"“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,” she said, sitting down next",
3629,to Harry and Ron. “And there’s a two-week waiting list. I wish I hadn’t left my copy at,
3630,"home, but I couldn’t fit it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.”",
3631,“Why do you want it?” said Harry.,
3632,"“The same reason everyone else wants it,” said Hermione, “to read up on the legend of",
3633,the Chamber of Secrets.”,
3634,“What’s that?” said Harry quickly.,
3635,"“That’s just it. I can’t remember,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “And I can’t find the sto",y
3636,anywhere else —”,
3637,"“Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron desperately, checking his watch.",

3639,"“I only need another two inches, come on —”",
3640,"The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of Magic, bickering.",
3641,"History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Professor Binns, who taught",

3646,not varied in the slightest since.,
3647,Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes and began to read in a,

3655,had never happened before. Hermione put up her hand.,

3657,"Warlock Convention of 1289, looked amazed.",
3658,“Miss — er —?”,
3659,"“Granger, Professor. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of",

3674,"“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I suppose.” He peered at",

3682,"at them all, every face turned to his. Harry could tell he was completely thrown by such",
3683,an unusual show of interest.,
3684,"“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see… the Chamber of Secrets…",
3685,"“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago — the",
3686,precise date is uncertain — by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four,
3687,"school Houses are named after them: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena",
3688,"Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, far from prying Muggle",
3689,"eyes, for it was an age when magic was feared by common people, and witches and",
3690,wizards suffered much persecution.”,
3691,"He paused, gazed blearily around the room, and continued.",
3692,"“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, seeking out youngsters who",
3693,showed signs of magic and bringing them to the castle to be educated. But then,
3694,disagreements sprang up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and,
3695,the others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to,
3696,Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. He,
3697,"disliked taking students of Muggle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After",
3698,"a while, there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and Gryffindor,",
3699,and Slytherin left the school.”,
3700,"Professor Binns paused again, pursing his lips, looking like a wrinkled old tortoise.",
3701,"“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these honest facts have been",
3702,obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story goes that Slytherin,
3703,"had built a hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew nothing.",
3704,"“Slytherin, according to the legend, sealed the Chamber of Secrets so that none would",
3705,be able to open it until his own true heir arrived at the school. The heir alone would be,
3706,"able to unseal the Chamber of Secrets, unleash the horror within, and use it to purge the",
3707,school of all who were unworthy to study magic.”,
3708,"There was silence as he finished telling the story, but it wasn’t the usual, sleepy silence",
3709,that filled Professor Binns’s classes. There was unease in the air as everyone continued to,

3778,"As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the end of the very corridor",
3779,where the attack had happened. They stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had,
3780,"been that night, except that there was no stiff cat hanging from the torch bracket, and",
3781,an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message “The Chamber of Secrets has,

3914,“But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly.,
3915,"“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, dropping her voice still further with a",
3916,"quick glance across the room at Percy. “Of course, it would be difficult. And dangerous,",
3917,"very dangerous. We’d be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect —”",
3918,"“If, in a month or so, you feel like explaining, you will let us know, won’t you?” said R",n
3919,irritably.,
3920,"“All right,” said Hermione coldly. “What we’d need to do is to get inside the Slytherin",
3921,common room and ask Malfoy a few questions without him realizing it’s us.”,
3922,"“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed.",
3923,"“No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some Polyjuice Potion.”",
3924,“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together.,
3925,“Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —”,
3926,“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape?” muttered,
3927,Ron.,
3928,“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could change into three of,
3929,the Slytherins. No one would know it was us. Malfoy would probably tell us anything.,
3930,"He’s probably boasting about it in the Slytherin common room right now, if only we",
3931,could hear him.”,
3932,"“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, frowning. “What if we were",
3933,stuck looking like three of the Slytherins forever?”,
3934,"“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand impatiently. “But getting",
3935,hold of the recipe will be very difficult. Snape said it was in a book called Moste Poten,e
3936,Potions and it’s bound to be in the Restricted Section of the library.” There was only on,
3937,way to get out a book from the Restricted Section: You needed a signed note of,
3938,"permission from a teacher. “Hard to see why we’d want the book, really,” said Ron, “if we",
3939,"weren’t going to try and make one of the potions.” “I think,” said Hermione, “that if we",

3948,The Rogue Bludger,
3949,"Since the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart had not brought live",
3950,"creatures to class. Instead, he read passages from his books to them, and sometimes",
3951,reenacted some of the more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with,
3952,"these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a simple Transylvanian",
3953,"villager whom Lockhart had cured of a Babbling Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a",
3954,vampire who had been unable to eat anything except lettuce since Lockhart had dealt,
3955,with him.,
3956,Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next Defense Against the,
3957,"Dark Arts lesson, this time acting a werewolf. If he hadn’t had a very good reason for",
3958,"keeping Lockhart in a good mood, he would have refused to do it.",
3959,"“Nice loud howl, Harry — exactly — and then, if you’ll believe it, I pounced — like this",
3960,"— slammed him to the floor — thus with one hand, I managed to hold him down —",
3961,"with my other, I put my wand to his throat — I then screwed up my remaining strength",
3962,and performed the immensely complex Homorphus Charm - he let out a piteous moan,
3963,"— go on, Harry — higher than that — good — the fur vanished — the fangs shrank —",
3964,"and he turned back into a man. Simple, yet effective — and another village will",
3965,remember me forever as the hero who delivered them from the monthly terror of,
3966,werewolf attacks.”,
3967,The bell rang and Lockhart got to his feet.,
3968,“Homework — compose a poem about my defeat of the Wagga Wagga Werewolf!,
3969,Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the best one!”,

3976,“Ready?” Harry muttered.,
3977,"“Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously. “All right…”",
3978,"She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly in her hand, Harry",
3979,and Ron right behind her.,
3980,“Er — Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I wanted to — to get this book out,
3981,"of the library. Just for background reading.” She held out the piece of paper, her hand",
3982,"shaking slightly. “But the thing is, it’s in the Restricted Section of the library, so I",eed
3983,teacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me understand what you say in Gadding,
3984,with Ghouls about slow-acting venoms.”,
3985,"“Ah, Gadding with Ghouls!” said Lockhart, taking the note from Hermione and smiling",
3986,widely,
3987,at her. “Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?”,
3988,"“Oh, yes,” said Hermione eagerly. “So clever, the way you trapped that last one with the",
3989,teastrainer —”,
3990,"“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra",
3991,"help,” said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out an enormous peacock quill. “Yes, nice,",
3992,"isn’t it?” he said, misreading the revolted look on Ron’s face. “I usually save it for bo",k-
3993,signings.”,
3994,He scrawled an enormous loopy signature on the note and handed it back to Hermione.,
3995,"“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note with fumbling fingers and",
3996,"slipped it into her bag. “Tomorrow’s the first Quidditch match of the season, I believe?",
3997,"Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you’re a useful player. I was a Seeker, t",o. I

4012,“Just because he said you were the best student of the year —”,

4021,"Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though determined to detect a forgery,",
4022,but it passed the test. She stalked away between the lofty shelves and returned several,

4040,It was decorated with drawings of people halfway through transforming into other,
4041,people. Harry sincerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on their,
4042,faces.,
4043,"“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said Hermione as they scanned the",
4044,"recipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, fluxweed, and knotgrass,” she murmured, running her",
4045,"finger down the list of ingredients. “Well, they’re easy enough, they’re in the student",

4058,"“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she said. There were bright pink",
4059,patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter than usual. “I don’t want to break,

4068,"“All right, we’ll do it. But not toenails, okay?”",
4069,"“How long will it take to make, anyway?” said Harry as Hermione, looking happier,",

4071,"“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon and the lacewings have",
4072,"got to be stewed for twenty-one days… I’d say it’d be ready in about a month, if we can",
4073,get all the ingredients.”,
4074,“A month?” said Ron. “Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle-borns in the school,
4075,"by then!” But Hermione’s eyes narrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, “But",
4076,"it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.”",
4077,"However, while Hermione was checking that the coast was clear for them to leave the",
4078,"bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy",
4079,off his broom tomorrow.”,
4080,Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while thinking about the coming,
4081,"Quidditch match. He was nervous, mainly at the thought of what Wood would say if",
4082,"Gryffindor lost, but also at the idea of facing a team mounted on the fastest racing",
4083,brooms gold could buy. He had never wanted to beat Slytherin so badly. After half an,
4084,"hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got up, dressed, and went down to",
4085,"breakfast early, where he found the rest of the Gryffindor team huddled at the long,",
4086,"empty table, all looking uptight and not speaking much.",
4087,"As eleven o’clock approached, the whole school started to make its way down to the",
4088,Quidditch stadium. It was a muggy sort of day with a hint of thunder in the air. Ron and,
4089,Hermione came hurrying over to wish Harry good luck as he entered the locker rooms.,
4090,"The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down to listen to Wood’s",

4107,"Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to see Slytherin beaten, but the Slytherins in the",

4111,"“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch. “Three… two… one…”",

4118,"“Close one, Harry!” said George, streaking past him with his club in his hand, ready to",

4134,"“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, but he was wrong; as though it was magnetically attracted",

4254,"“Ah,” said Lockhart. “Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But the point is, the bones",
4255,"are no longer broken. That’s the thing to bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddle up to the",
4256,"hospital wing — ah, Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, would you escort him? — and Madam",
4257,Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a bit.”,
4258,"As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep breath he looked",
4259,down at his right side. What he saw nearly made him pass out again.,
4260,"Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, flesh-colored rubber",
4261,glove. He tried to move his fingers. Nothing happened.,
4262,Lockhart hadn’t mended Harry’s bones. He had removed them.,
4263,Madam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased.,
4264,"“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, holding up the sad, limp remainder",
4265,"of what, half an hour before, had been a working arm. “I can mend bones in a second —",
4266,but growing them back —”,
4267,"“You will be able to, won’t you?” said Harry desperately.",
4268,"“I’ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly, throwing",
4269,Harry a pair of pajamas. “You’ll have to stay the night…”,
4270,Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry’s bed while Ron helped him,
4271,"into his pajamas. It took a while to stuff the rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve.",
4272,"“How can you stick up for Lockhart now, Hermione, eh?” Ron called through the curtain",
4273,as he pulled Harry’s limp fingers through the cuff. “If Harry had wanted deboning he,
4274,would have asked.”,
4275,"“Anyone can make a mistake,” said Hermione. “And it doesn’t hurt anymore, does it,",
4276,Harry?”,
4277,"“No,” said Harry, getting into bed. “But it doesn’t do anything else either.”",

4282,"As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly.",
4283,Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. Madam Pomfrey was holding,
4284,a large bottle of something labeled Skele-Gro.,
4285,"“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a steaming beakerful and handing it",
4286,to him. “Regrowing bones is a nasty business.”,
4287,"So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry’s mouth and throat as it went down,",
4288,making him cough and splutter. Still tut-tutting about dangerous sports and inept,
4289,"teachers, Madam Pomfrey retreated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp",
4290,"down some water. “We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. “That",
4291,was some catch you made. Malfoy’s face… he looked ready to kill…”,
4292,"“I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said Hermione darkly.",
4293,“We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him when we’ve taken the Polyjuice,
4294,"Potion,” said Harry, sinking back onto his pillows. “I hope it tastes better than this",
4295,stuff…”,
4296,"“If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be joking,” said Ron.",
4297,"The door of the hospital wing burst open at that moment. Filthy and soaking wet, the",
4298,"rest of the Gryffindor team had arrived to see Harry. “Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said",
4299,George. “I’ve just seen Marcus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Something about having the,
4300,Snitch on top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.” They had,
4301,"brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; they gathered around Harry’s bed",
4302,and were just getting started on what promised to be a good party when Madam,
4303,"Pomfrey came storming over, shouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty-three bones",
4304,"to regrow! Out! OUT!” And Harry was left alone, with nothing to distract him from the",
4305,stabbing pains in his limp arm.,
4306,"Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch blackness and gave a",
4307,"small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of large splinters. For a second, he thought that",
4308,was what had woken,
4309,"him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was sponging his forehead in",

4315,"“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “Dobby!”",
4316,The house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry through the darkness. A,
4317,"single tear was running down his long, pointed nose.",
4318,"“Harry Potter came back to school,” he whispered miserably. “Dobby warned and",
4319,"warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn’t you heed Dobby? Why didn’t Harry Potter go",
4320,back home when he missed the train?”,
4321,Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby’s sponge away.,
4322,“What’re you doing here?” he said. “And how did you know I missed the train?”,
4323,Dobby’s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspicion.,
4324,“It was you!” he said slowly. “You stopped the barrier from letting us through!”,
4325,"“Indeed yes, sir,” said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears flapping. “Dobby hid",
4326,and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands,

4345,"“This, sir?” said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. “‘Tis a mark of the house-elf’s",

4349,"Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said suddenly, “Harry Potter must go home!",

4351,"“Your Bludger?” said Harry, anger rising once more. “What d’you mean, your Bludger?",
4352,You made that Bludger try and kill me?”,
4353,"“Not kill you, sir, never kill you!” said Dobby, shocked. “Dobby wants to save Harry",

4356,"“Oh, is that all?” said Harry angrily. “I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you",
4357,wanted me sent home in pieces?”,
4358,"“Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more tears dripping onto his ragged",
4359,"pillowcase. “If he knew what he means to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the",
4360,magical world! Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was,
4361,"at the height of his powers, sir! We house-elves were treated like vermin, sir! Of course,",
4362,"Dobby is still treated like that, sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. “But",
4363,"mostly, sir, life has improved for my kind since you triumphed over He-Who-Must-Not-",

4373,"Dobby froze, horrorstruck, then grabbed Harry’s water jug from his bedside table and",
4374,"cracked it over his own head, toppling out of sight. A second later, he crawled back onto",
4375,"the bed, crosseyed, muttering, “Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby…”",
4376,“So there is a Chamber of Secrets?” Harry whispered. “And did you say it’s been opened,
4377,"before? Tell me, Dobby!”",
4378,He seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched toward the water jug. “But I’m not,
4379,Muggle-born — how can I be in danger from the Chamber?”,
4380,"“Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,” stammered the elf, his eyes huge in",
4381,"the dark. “Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must not be here when",
4382,"they happen — go home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in this,",
4383,"sir, ‘tis too dangerous —”",
4384,"“Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, keeping a firm hold on Dobby’s wrist to stop him from",
4385,hitting himself with the water jug again. “Who’s opened it? Who opened it last time?”,
4386,"“Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!” squealed the elf. “Go home, Harry",
4387,"Potter, go home!”",
4388,“I’m not going anywhere!” said Harry fiercely. “One of my best friends is Muggle-born;,
4389,she’ll be first in line if the Chamber really has been opened —”,
4390,“Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!” moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable,
4391,"ecstasy. “So noble! So valiant! But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not",

4393,"Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, too. There were footsteps",
4394,coming down the passageway outside.,
4395,"“Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud crack, and Harry’s fist was",
4396,"suddenly clenched on thin air. He slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorway",
4397,to the hospital wing as the footsteps drew nearer.,
4398,"Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, wearing a long woolly",

4404,"Professor McGonagall appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved",
4405,it onto a bed.,
4406,"“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and Professor McGonagall hurried past",
4407,"the end of Harry’s bed out of sight. Harry lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He",
4408,"heard urgent voices, and then Professor McGonagall swept back into view, closely",
4409,"followed by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her nightdress. He",
4410,heard a sharp intake of breath.,
4411,"“What happened?” Madam Pomfrey whispered to Dumbledore, bending over the statue",
4412,on the bed.,
4413,"“Another attack,” said Dumbledore. “Minerva found him on the stairs.”",
4414,"“There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said Professor McGonagall. “We think he",
4415,was trying to sneak up here to visit Potter.”,
4416,"Harry’s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he raised himself a few",
4417,inches so he could look at the statue on the bed. A ray of moonlight lay across its,
4418,staring face.,
4419,"It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were stuck up in front of him,",
4420,holding his camera.,
4421,“Petrified?” whispered Madam Pomfrey.,
4422,"“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “But I shudder to think… If Albus hadn’t been on the",

4424,The three of them stared down at Colin. Then Dumbledore leaned forward and,

4449,CHAPTER ELEVEN,
4450,The Dueling Club,
4451,Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight,
4452,"and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin’s bed, but",
4453,it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind,
4454,"yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a",
4455,breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.,
4456,"“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-handed. “When you’ve",
4457,"finished eating, you may leave.”",
4458,"Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to",
4459,"tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren’t there. Harry left to look",
4460,"for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they",
4461,weren’t interested in whether he had his bones back or not.,
4462,"As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, looking in far better spirits",
4463,than last time they’d met.,
4464,"“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excellent flying yesterday, really excellent. Gryffindor has j",st
4465,taken the lead for the House Cup — you earned fifty points!”,
4466,"“You haven’t seen Ron or Hermione, have you?” said Harry.",
4467,"“No, I haven’t,” said Percy, his smile fading. “I hope Ron’s not in another girls’ toilet…”",

4472,"Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for",
4473,Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. He couldn’t see why Ron and Hermione would be in there,
4474,"again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened",
4475,the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.,
4476,"“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp",
4477,from within the stall and he saw Hermione’s eye peering through the keyhole.,
4478,“Harry!” she said. “You gave us such a fright — come in. How’s your arm?”,
4479,"“Fine,” said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet,",
4480,and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up,
4481,"portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione’s.",
4482,"“We’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion,” Ron",
4483,"explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. “We’ve decided this is the safe",t
4484,place to hide it.”,
4485,"Harry started to tell them about Colin, but Hermione interrupted.",
4486,“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling Professor Flitwick this,
4487,morning. That’s why we decided we’d better get going —”,
4488,"“The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,” snarled Ron. “D’you know",
4489,"what I think? He was in such a foul temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on",
4490,Colin.”,
4491,"“There’s something else,” said Harry, watching Hermione tearing bundles of knotgrass",
4492,and throwing them into the potion. “Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.”,
4493,"Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them everything Dobby had told him",
4494,— or hadn’t told him. Hermione and Ron listened with their mouths open.,
4495,“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before?” Hermione said.,
4496,"“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice. “Lucius Malfoy must’ve opened the",
4497,Chamber when he was at school here and now he’s told dear old Draco how to do it. It’s,

4502,"obvious. Wish Dobby’d told you what kind of monster’s in there, though. I want to know",
4503,how come nobody’s noticed it sneaking around the school.”,
4504,"“Maybe it can make itself invisible,” said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of",
4505,the cauldron. “Or maybe it can disguise itself — pretend to be a suit of armor or,
4506,something — I’ve read about Chameleon Ghouls —”,
4507,"“You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the",
4508,leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.,
4509,“So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm.” He shook his,
4510,"head. “You know what, Harry? If he doesn’t stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill",
4511,you.”,
4512,The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the,
4513,hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was,
4514,suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the,
4515,"castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured",
4516,forth alone.,
4517,"Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt",
4518,that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were,
4519,taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind,
4520,"statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to",
4521,write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.,
4522,"Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other",
4523,"protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-",
4524,"smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other",
4525,"Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pure-blood, and",
4526,therefore unlikely to be attacked.,
4527,"“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face fearful. “And everyone knows I’m",
4528,almost a Squib.”,
4529,"In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual,",
4530,"collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and",
4531,"Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as",

4536,very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and,
4537,try to worm a confession out of him.,
4538,"Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the bicorn horn and",
4539,"the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape’s",
4540,private stores. Harry privately felt he’d rather face Slytherin’s legendary monster than le,
4541,Snape catch him robbing his office.,
4542,"“What we need,” said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon’s double Potions lesson",
4543,"loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape’s office and take",
4544,what we need.”,
4545,Harry and Ron looked at her nervously.,
4546,"“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone.",
4547,"“You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I’ve got a clean record.",
4548,So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or,
4549,so.”,
4550,Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s Potions class was about as,
4551,safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the eye.,
4552,Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon’s lesson,
4553,proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden,
4554,"desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the",
4555,"fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors’ work while the Slytherins",
4556,"sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape’s favorite student, kept flicking",
4557,"puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get",
4558,detention faster than you could say “Unfair.”,
4559,"Harry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important",
4560,"things. He was waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened as Snape paused to",
4561,"sneer at his watery potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville,",
4562,Hermione caught Harry’s eye and nodded.,
4563,"Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks",
4564,"out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The firework began to fizz and",

4569,"sputter. Knowing he had only seconds, Harry straightened up, took aim, and lobbed it",
4570,into the air; it landed right on target in Goyle’s cauldron.,
4571,"Goyle’s potion exploded, showering the whole class. People shrieked as splashes of the",
4572,Swelling Solution hit them. Malfoy got a faceful and his nose began to swell like a,
4573,"balloon; Goyle blundered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the",
4574,size of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm and find out what had,
4575,"happened. Through the confusion, Harry",
4576,saw Hermione slip quietly into Snape’s office.,
4577,"“Silence! SILENCE!” Snape roared. “Anyone who has been splashed, come here for a",
4578,Deflating Draft — when I find out who did this —”,
4579,"Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, his head drooping with",
4580,"the weight of a nose like a small melon. As half the class lumbered up to Snape’s desk,",
4581,"some weighted down with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic",
4582,"puffed-up lips, Harry saw Hermione slide back into the dungeon, the front of her robes",
4583,bulging.,
4584,"When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various swellings had subsided,",
4585,Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and scooped out the twisted black remains of the,
4586,firework. There was a sudden hush.,
4587,"“If I ever find out who threw this,” Snape whispered, “I shall make sure that person is",
4588,expelled.”,
4589,Harry arranged his face into what he hoped was a puzzled expression. Snape was,
4590,"looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten minutes later could not have been more",
4591,welcome.,
4592,"“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they hurried back to Moaning",
4593,Myrtle’s bathroom. “I could tell.”,

4940,Harry couldn’t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of the Hufflepuffs had,
4941,been saying about him.,
4942,"“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’d better get going, Hagrid, it’s Transfiguration next and I’",e go
4943,to pick up my books.”,
4944,"He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about him.",
4945,“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he let slip to Potte,he
4946,was Muggle-born…”,
4947,"Harry stamped up the stairs and turned along another corridor, which was particularly",
4948,"dark; the torches had been extinguished by a strong, icy draft that was blowing through",
4949,a loose windowpane. He was halfway down the passage when he tripped headlong over,
4950,something lying on the floor.,
4951,He turned to squint at what he’d fallen over and felt as though his stomach had,
4952,dissolved.,
4953,"Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on",his
4954,"face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn’t all. Next to him was anot",er
4955,"figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.",
4956,"It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and",
4957,"smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off",
4958,and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin’s.,

4963,"Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll",
4964,against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of,
4965,spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the,
4966,muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side.,
4967,"He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. But he couldn’t just",
4968,leave them lying here… He had to get help… Would anyone believe he hadn’t had,
4969,anything to do with this?,
4970,"As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened with a bang. Peeves the",
4971,Poltergeist came shooting out.,
4972,"“Why, it’s potty wee Potter!” cackled Peeves, knocking Harry’s glasses askew as he",
4973,bounced,
4974,past him. “What’s Potter up to? Why’s Potter lurking —”,
4975,"Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin",
4976,"and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry",
4977,"could stop him,",
4978,"screamed, “ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE!",
4979,RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! ATTAAAACK!”,
4980,Crash — crash — crash — door after door flew open along the corridor and people,
4981,"flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin",
4982,was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick.,
4983,Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor,
4984,"McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-",
4985,"white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and",
4986,ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat,
4987,"than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.",
4988,"“Caught in the act!” Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing his finger dramatically",at
4989,Harry.,
4990,"“That will do, Macmillan!” said Professor McGonagall sharply.",
4991,"Peeves was bobbing overhead, now grinning wickedly, surveying the scene; Peeves",
4992,"always loved chaos. As the teachers bent over Justin and Nearly Headless Nick,",
4993,"examining them, Peeves broke into song:",

4998,"“Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, You’re killing off’ students, you think it’",
4999,good fun —”,
5000,"“That’s enough Peeves!” barked Professor McGonagall, and Peeves zoomed away",
5001,"backward, with his tongue out at Harry.",
5002,Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of,
5003,"the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly",
5004,"Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air,",
5005,which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This,
5006,"Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor",
5007,McGonagall alone together.,
5008,"“This way, Potter,” she said.",
5009,"“Professor,” said Harry at once, “I swear I didn’t —”",
5010,"“This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall curtly.",
5011,They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before a large and extremely,
5012,ugly stone gargoyle.,
5013,"“Lemon drop!” she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang",
5014,suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread,
5015,"for what was coming, Harry couldn’t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral",
5016,"staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor",
5017,"McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose",
5018,"upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming",
5019,"oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.",
5020,He knew now where he was being taken. This must be where Dumbledore lived.,

5030,The Polyjuice Potion,
5031,"They stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor McGonagall rapped on",
5032,the door. It opened silently and they entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait,
5033,"and left him there, alone.",
5034,Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ offices Harry had visited,
5035,"so far this year, Dumbledore’s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn’t been scared",
5036,"out of his wits that he was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very",
5037,pleased to have a chance to look around it.,
5038,"It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little noises. A number of curious",
5039,"silver instruments stood on spindle legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of",
5040,"smoke. The walls were covered with portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses, all",
5041,"of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an enormous, claw-footed",
5042,"desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a shabby, tattered wizard’s hat — the Sorting Hat.",
5043,Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches and wizards on the,
5044,walls. Surely it couldn’t hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? Just to see…,
5045,just to make sure it had put him in the right House.,
5046,"He walked quietly around the desk, lifted the hat from its shelf, and lowered it slowly",
5047,"onto his head. It was much too large and slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done",
5048,"the last time he’d put it on. Harry stared at the black inside of the hat, waiting. Then a",
5049,"small voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?”",
5050,"“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you — I wanted to ask —”",
5051,"“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,” said the hat smartly.",
5052,“Yes… you were particularly difficult to place. But I stand by what I said before —”,
5053,Harry’s heart leapt — “you would have done well in Slytherin —”,
5054,Harry’s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat and pulled it off. It hung,
5055,"limply in his hand, grubby and faded. Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick.",

5060,"“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn’t move. Harry backed",
5061,"away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging noise behind him made him wheel around.",
5062,He wasn’t alone after all. Standing on a golden perch behind the door was a decrepit-,
5063,looking bird that resembled a half-plucked turkey. Harry stared at it and the bird looked,
5064,"balefully back, making its gagging noise again. Harry thought it looked very ill. Its eyes",
5065,"were dull and, even as Harry watched, a couple more feathers fell out of its tail.",
5066,Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore’s pet bird to die while he,
5067,"was alone in the office with it, when the bird burst into flames.",
5068,Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked feverishly around in,
5069,"case there was a glass of water somewhere but couldn’t see one; the bird, meanwhile,",
5070,had become a fireball; it gave one loud shriek and next second there was nothing but a,
5071,smoldering pile of ash on the floor.,
5072,"The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very somber.",
5073,"“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird — I couldn’t do anything — he just caught fire —”",
5074,"To Harry’s astonishment, Dumbledore smiled.",
5075,"“About time, too,” he said. “He’s been looking dreadful for days; I’ve been telling him to",
5076,get a move on.”,
5077,He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face.,
5078,"“Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die",
5079,and are reborn from the ashes. Watch him…”,
5080,"Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird poke its head out of the",
5081,ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one.,
5082,"“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,” said Dumbledore, seating himself",
5083,"behind his desk. “He’s really very handsome most of the time, wonderful red and gold",

5088,"plumage. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their",
5089,"tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.”",
5090,"In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what he was there for, but it all",
5091,came back to him as Dumbledore settled himself in the high chair behind the desk and,
5092,"fixed Harry with his penetrating, light-blue stare.",
5093,"Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the door of the office flew",
5094,"open with an almighty bang and Hagrid burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava",
5095,perched on top of his shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his,
5096,hand.,
5097,"“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledore!” said Hagrid urgently. “I was talkin’ ter him",
5098,"seconds before that kid was found, he never had time, sir —”",
5099,"Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting on, waving the rooster",
5100,"around in his agitation, sending feathers everywhere.",
5101,"“it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swear it in front o’ the Ministry o’ Magic if I have to.”",
5102,"“Hagrid, I —”",
5103,"“— yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never —”",
5104,“Hagrid!” said Dumbledore loudly. “I do not think that Harry attacked those people.”,
5105,"“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster falling limply at his side. “Right. I’ll wait outside then,",
5106,Headmaster.”,
5107,And he stomped out looking embarrassed.,
5108,"“You don’t think it was me, Professor?” Harry repeated hopefully as Dumbledore",
5109,brushed rooster feathers off his desk.,
5110,"“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Dumbledore, though his face was somber again. “But I still",
5111,want to talk to you.”,

5116,"Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the tips of his long fingers",
5117,together.,
5118,"“I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you’d like to tell me,” he said gently.",
5119,“Anything at all.”,
5120,"Harry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, “You’ll be next,",
5121,Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuice Potion simmering away in Moaning Myrtle’s,
5122,bathroom. Then he thought of the disembodied voice he had heard twice and,
5123,"remembered what Ron had said: “Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign,",
5124,"even in the wizarding world.” He thought, too, about what everyone was saying about",
5125,"him, and his growing dread that he was somehow connected with Salazar Slytherin…",
5126,"“No,” said Harry. “There isn’t anything, Professor…”",
5127,The double attack on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick turned what had hitherto been,
5128,"nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it was Nearly Headless Nick’s fate that seemed to",
5129,worry people most. What could possibly do that to a ghost? people asked each other;,
5130,what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? There was almost a,
5131,stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Express so that students could go home for,
5132,Christmas.,
5133,"“At this rate, we’ll be the only ones left,” Ron told Harry and Hermione. “Us, Malfoy,",
5134,"Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday it’s going to be.”",
5135,"Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had signed up to stay over the",
5136,"holidays, too. But Harry was glad that most people were leaving. He was tired of people",
5137,"skirting around him in the corridors, as though he was about to sprout fangs or spit",
5138,"poison; tired of all the muttering, pointing, and hissing as he passed.",
5139,"Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went out of their way to",
5140,"march ahead of Harry down the corridors, shouting, “Make way for the Heir of Slytherin,",
5141,seriously evil wizard coming through…”,
5142,Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior.,

5148,"“Oh, get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred. “Harry’s in a hurry.”",
5149,"“Yeah, he’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his fanged servant,” said",
5150,"George, chortling.",
5151,Ginny didn’t find it amusing either.,
5152,"“Oh, don’t,” she wailed every time Fred asked Harry loudly who he was planning to",
5153,"attack next, or when George pretended to ward Harry off with a large clove of garlic",
5154,when they met.,
5155,"Harry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and George, at least, thought the",
5156,idea of his being Slytherin’s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be,
5157,"aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it.",
5158,"“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said Ron knowingly. “You know how he",
5159,"hates anyone beating him at anything, and you’re getting all the credit for his dirty",
5160,work.”,
5161,"“Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The Polyjuice Potion’s nearly ready.",
5162,We’ll be getting the truth out of him any day now.”,
5163,"At last the term ended, and a silence deep as the snow on the grounds descended on",
5164,"the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather than gloomy, and enjoyed the fact that he,",
5165,"Hermione, and the Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could",
5166,"play Exploding Snap loudly without bothering anyone, and practice dueling in private.",
5167,"Fred, George, and Ginny had chosen to stay at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with",
5168,"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish",
5169,"behavior, didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had already told",
5170,them pompously that he was only staying over Christmas because it was his duty as a,
5171,prefect to support the teachers during this troubled time.,
5172,"Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, the only ones left in their",
5173,"dormitory, were woken very early by Hermione, who burst in, fully dressed and carrying",
5174,presents for them both.,

5180,"“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here —” said Ron, shielding his eyes against",
5181,the light.,
5182,"“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione, throwing him his present. “I’ve been up",
5183,"for nearly an hour, adding more lacewings to the potion. It’s ready.”",
5184,"Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake.",
5185,“Are you sure?”,
5186,"“Positive,” said Hermione, shifting Scabbers the rat so that she could sit down on the",
5187,"end of Ron’s four-poster. “If we’re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.”",
5188,"At that moment, Hedwig swooped into the room, carrying a very small package in her",
5189,beak.,
5190,"“Hello,” said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. “Are you speaking to me again?”",
5191,"She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far better present than",
5192,"the one that she had brought him, which turned out to be from the Dursleys. They had",
5193,sent Harry a toothpick and a note telling him to find out whether he’d be able to stay at,
5194,"Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too.",
5195,The rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more satisfactory. Hagrid had sent him a,
5196,"large tin of treacle fudge, which Harry decided to soften by the fire before eating; Ron",
5197,"had given him a book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts about",
5198,"his favorite Quidditch team, and Hermione had bought him a luxurious eagle-feather",
5199,"quill. Harry opened the last present to find a new, hand-knitted sweater from Mrs.",
5200,"Weasley and a large plum cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking",
5201,about Mr. Weasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash with the Whomping,
5202,"Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron were planning next.",
5203,"No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, could fail to enjoy",

5209,The Great Hall looked magnificent. Not only were there a dozen frost-covered Christmas,
5210,"trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted",
5211,"snow was falling, warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of his",
5212,"favorite carols, Hagrid booming more and more loudly with every goblet of eggnog he",
5213,"consumed. Percy, who hadn’t noticed that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that",
5214,"it now read “Pinhead,” kept asking them all what they were sniggering at. Harry didn’t",
5215,"even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remark about his new sweater from",
5216,"the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, Malfoy would be getting his comeuppance in a",
5217,few hours’ time.,
5218,Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of Christmas pudding when,
5219,Hermione ushered them out of the hall to finalize their plans for the evening.,
5220,"“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said Hermione matter-of-factly,",
5221,as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. “And,
5222,"obviously, it’ll be best if you can get something of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoys",
5223,"best friends, he’ll tell",
5224,them anything. And we also need to make sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’t burst in,
5225,on us while we’re interrogating him.,
5226,"“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly, ignoring Harry’s and Ron’s stupefied",
5227,faces. She held up two plump chocolate cakes. “I’ve filled these with a simple Sleeping,
5228,Draught. All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them. You know how,
5229,"greedy they are, they’re bound to eat them. Once they’re asleep, pull out a few of their",
5230,hairs and hide them in a broom closet.”,
5231,Harry and Ron looked incredulously at each other.,
5232,"“Hermione, I don’t think —”",
5233,“That could go seriously wrong —”,
5234,But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one Professor McGonagall,
5235,sometimes had.,
5236,"“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair,” she said sternly. “You do",
5237,"want to investigate Malfoy, don’t you?”",

5242,"“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about you? Whose hair are you ripping",
5243,out?”,
5244,"“I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny bottle out of her pocket",
5245,and showing them the single hair inside it. “Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with,
5246,me at the Dueling Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me!,
5247,And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just have to tell the Slytherins I’ve decide,
5248,to come back.”,
5249,"When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Potion again, Ron turned to",
5250,Harry with a doom-laden expression.,
5251,“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong?”,
5252,"But to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one of the operation went just as",
5253,smoothly as,
5254,"Hermione had said. They lurked in the deserted entrance hall after Christmas tea,",
5255,"waiting for Crabbe and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shoveling",
5256,down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the chocolate cakes on the end of the,
5257,"banisters. When they spotted Crabbe and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and",
5258,Ron hid quickly behind a suit of armor next to the front door.,
5259,“How thick can you get?” Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe gleefully pointed out the,
5260,"cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grinning stupidly, they stuffed the cakes whole into",
5261,"their large mouths. For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on",
5262,"their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over",
5263,backward onto the floor.,
5264,By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the hall. Once they were,
5265,"safely stowed among the buckets and mops, Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles that",
5266,covered Goyle’s forehead and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe’s hairs. They also stole their,
5267,"shoes, because their own were far too small for Crabbe - and Goyle-size feet. Then, still",
5268,"stunned at what they had just done, they sprinted up to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom.",

5274,"was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked",
5275,softly on the door.,
5276,“Hermione?”,
5277,"They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, shiny-faced and looking",
5278,"anxious. Behind her they heard the gloop gloop of the bubbling, glutinous potion. Three",
5279,glass tumblers stood ready on the toilet seat.,
5280,“Did you get them?” Hermione asked breathlessly.,
5281,Harry showed her Goyle’s hair.,
5282,"“Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,” Hermione said, holding up",
5283,a small sack. “You’ll need bigger sizes once you’re Crabbe and Goyle.”,
5284,"The three of them stared into the cauldron. Close up, the potion looked like thick, dark",

5686,"“Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention,” said Ron",

6182,would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn’t get,
6183,any guidance: Percy Weasley was eager to share his experience.,

6360,"had wandered the castle at night several times before, had never seen it so crowded",
6361,"after sunset. Teachers, prefects, and ghosts were marching the corridors in pairs, staring",
6362,around for any unusual activity. Their Invisibility Cloak didn’t stop them making any,
6363,"noise, and there was a particularly tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards",
6364,"from the spot where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at almost",
6365,exactly the moment Ron swore. It was with relief that they reached the oak front doors,
6366,and eased them open.,
6367,"It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows of Hagrid’s house and",
6368,pulled off the cloak only when they were right outside his front door.,

6380,"“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice.",

6694,"“We’ve come this far,” said Ron.",
6695,So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn’t move,
6696,"very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the",
6697,"near blackness. Harry could feel Fang’s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they",
6698,"had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.",
6699,"They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their robes snagging on low-",
6700,"slung branches and brambles. After a while, they noticed that the ground seemed to be",
6701,"sloping downward, though the trees were as thick as ever.",
6702,"Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making both Harry and Ron jump",
6703,out of their skins.,
6704,"“What?” said Ron loudly, looking around into the pitch-dark, and gripping Harry’s elbow",
6705,very hard.,
6706,"“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Listen… sounds like something",
6707,big…”,
6708,"They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big was snapping branches as",
6709,it carved a path through the trees.,
6710,"“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —”",

6715,"“Shut up,” said Harry frantically. “It’ll hear you.”",
6716,“Hear me?” said Ron in an unnaturally high voice. “It’s already heard Fang!”,
6717,"The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they stood, terrified, waiting.",
6718,There was a strange rumbling noise and then silence.,
6719,“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry.,
6720,"“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron.",
6721,"They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move.",
6722,“D’you think it’s gone?” Harry whispered.,
6723,“Dunno —”,
6724,"Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in the darkness that both of",
6725,"them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got",
6726,lodged in a tangle of thorns and yelped even louder.,
6727,"“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice breaking with relief “Harry, it’s our car!”",
6728,“What?”,
6729,“Come on!”,
6730,"Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and tripping, and a moment later",
6731,they had emerged into a clearing.,
6732,"Mr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle of thick trees under a",
6733,"roof of dense branches, its headlights ablaze. As Ron walked, open-mouthed, toward it,",
6734,"it moved slowly toward him, exactly like a large, turquoise dog greeting its owner.",
6735,"“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly, walking around the car. “Look at it.",

6741,The sides of the car were scratched and smeared with mud. Apparently it had taken to,
6742,trundling around the forest on its own. Fang didn’t seem at all keen on it; he kept clos,
6743,"to Harry, who could feel him quivering. His breathing slowing down again, Harry stuffed",
6744,his wand back into his robes.,
6745,"“And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, leaning against the car and",
6746,patting it. “I wondered where it had gone!”,
6747,"Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more spiders, but they had all",
6748,scuttled away from the glare of the headlights.,
6749,"“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find them.”",
6750,Ron didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed on a point some ten feet above,
6751,"the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face was livid with terror.",
6752,Harry didn’t even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and,
6753,suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off,
6754,"the ground, so that he was hanging facedown. Struggling, terrified, he heard more",
6755,"clicking, and saw Ron’s legs leave the ground, too, heard Fang whimpering and howling",
6756,"— next moment, he was being swept away into the dark trees.",
6757,"Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was marching on six immensely",
6758,"long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him tightly below a pair of shining black pinc",rs.
6759,"Behind him, he could hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were",
6760,moving into the very heart of the forest. Harry could hear Fang fighting to free himself,
6761,"from a third monster, whining loudly, but Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had",
6762,wanted to; he seemed to have left his voice back with the car in the clearing.,
6763,He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he only knew that the,
6764,darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now,
6765,"swarming with spiders. Craning his neck sideways, he realized that they had reached the",
6766,"ridge of a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the stars shone",
6767,brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on.,
6768,Spiders. Not tiny spiders like those surging over the leaves below. Spiders the size of,
6769,"carthorses, eight-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, gigantic. The massive specimen that",

6775,"the very center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, clicking their",
6776,pincers excitedly at the sight of its load.,
6777,Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded,
6778,"down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron",
6779,looked exactly like Harry felt. His mouth was stretched wide in a kind of silent scream,
6780,and his eyes were popping.,
6781,Harry suddenly realized that the spider that had dropped him was saying something. It,
6782,"had been hard to tell, because he clicked his pincers with every word he spoke.",
6783,“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!”,
6784,"And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size of a small elephant",
6785,"emerged, very slowly. There was gray in the black of his body and legs, and each of the",
6786,"eyes on his ugly, pincered head was milky white. He was blind.",
6787,"“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly.",
6788,"“Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry.",
6789,"“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes wandering vaguely.",
6790,"“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron.",
6791,"“Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping…”",
6792,"“We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to have left his chest to",
6793,pound in his throat.,
6794,"Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the hollow.",

6801,"“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harry, breathing very fast. “That’s why we’ve come.”",
6802,"“In trouble?” said the aged spider, and Harry thought he heard concern beneath the",
6803,clicking pincers. “But why has he sent you?”,
6804,Harry thought of getting to his feet but decided against it; he didn’t think his legs would,
6805,"support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could.",
6806,"“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a — a — something on",
6807,students. They’ve taken him to Azkaban.”,
6808,"Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hollow the sound was echoed by",
6809,"the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn’t usually make Harry feel",
6810,sick with fear.,
6811,"“But that was years ago,” said Aragog fretfully. “Years and years ago. I remember it well.",
6812,That’s why they made him leave the school. They believed that I was the monster that,
6813,dwells in what they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had opened,
6814,the Chamber and set me free.”,
6815,"“And you… you didn’t come from the Chamber of Secrets?” said Harry, who could feel",
6816,cold sweat on his forehead.,
6817,"“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in the castle. I come from a distant",
6818,"land. A traveler gave me to Hagrid when I was an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he",
6819,"cared for me, hidden in a cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table.",
6820,"Hagrid is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and blamed for the",
6821,"death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in the forest ever since, where Hagrid",
6822,"still visits me. He even found me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown,",
6823,all through Hagrid’s goodness…”,
6824,Harry summoned what remained of his courage.,
6825,“So you never — never attacked anyone?”,

6837,legs shifting angrily; large black shapes shifted all around him.,

6841,“What is it?” said Harry urgently.,
6842,"More loud clicking, more rustling; the spiders seemed to be closing in.",
6843,“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name it! I never even told,

6862,blaze of light flamed through the hollow.,
6863,"Mr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, headlights glaring, its horn",
6864,"screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were thrown onto their backs, their endless",
6865,legs waving in the air. The car screeched to a halt in front of Harry and Ron and the,
6866,doors flew open.,
6867,"“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around",
6868,"the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car — the doors slammed shut",
6869,— Ron didn’t touch the accelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine roared and,
6870,"they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they",
6871,"were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car",
6872,"wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.",
6873,"Harry looked sideways at Ron. His mouth was still open in the silent scream, but his eyes",
6874,weren’t popping anymore.,
6875,“Are you okay?”,
6876,"Ron stared straight ahead, unable to speak.",
6877,"They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howling loudly in the back seat,",
6878,and Harry saw the side mirror snap off as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten,
6879,"noisy, rocky minutes, the trees thinned, and Harry could again see patches of sky.",
6880,The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had,
6881,reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get,
6882,"out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house,",
6883,"tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain",
6884,"the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a",
6885,grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.,
6886,Harry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the Invisibility Cloak. Fang was trembling,
6887,"under a blanket in his basket. When Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violent",
6888,sick in the pumpkin patch.,

6895,"“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn’t hurt friends of his,” said Harry.",
6896,"“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem!” said Ron, thumping the wall of the cabin. “He always",
6897,"thinks monsters aren’t as bad as they’re made out, and look where it’s got him! A cell in",
6898,Azkaban!” He was shivering uncontrollably now. “What was the point of sending us in,
6899,"there? What have we found out, I’d like to know?”",
6900,"“That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets,” said Harry, throwing the cloak over",
6901,Ron and prodding him in the arm to make him walk. “He was innocent.”,
6902,"Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard wasn’t his idea of",
6903,being innocent.,
6904,As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were,
6905,"hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the",
6906,"entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors",
6907,where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor,

6909,cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.,

6965,“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school running as normally as,

6969,slippers. What had he learned so far this year? He couldn’t seem to think of anything,
6970,that would be useful in an exam.,

7089,"“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified. person,” she said, and they had to admit she",
7090,had a point when they’d taken their seats next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione,
7091,"didn’t have the faintest inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tel",
7092,her bedside cabinet not to worry for all the good it would do.,
7093,"“Wonder if she did see the attacker, though?” said Ron, looking sadly at Hermione’s",

7095,But Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was more interested in her right hand.,
7096,"It lay clenched on top of her blankets, and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper",
7097,was scrunched inside her fist.,
7098,"Making sure that Madam Pomfrey was nowhere near, he pointed this out to Ron.",

7106,"Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While Ron kept watch he tugged and twisted,",
7107,"and at last, after several tense minutes, the paper came free.",
7108,It was a page torn from a very old library book. Harry smoothed it out eagerly and Ron,

7400,"“Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart, with a shadow of his old smile. “I’ll",

7402,"He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both pointed their wands at him.",
7403,"“You can go first,” Ron snarled.",
7404,"White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening.",
7405,"“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will it do?”",
7406,Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his legs into the pipe.,
7407,"“I really don’t think —” he started to say, but Ron gave him a push, and he slid out of",
7408,"sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered himself slowly into the pipe, then let go.",
7409,"It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could see more pipes",
7410,"branching off in all directions, but none as large as theirs, which twisted and turned,",
7411,"sloping steeply downward, and he knew that he was falling deeper below the school",
7412,"than even the dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the curves.",
7413,"And then, just as he had begun to worry about what would happen when he hit the",
7414,"ground, the pipe leveled out, and he shot out of the end with a wet thud, landing on the",
7415,damp floor of a dark stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his,
7416,"feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry stood aside as Ron",
7417,"came whizzing out of the pipe, too.",
7418,"“We must be miles under the school,” said Harry, his voice echoing in the black tunnel.",
7419,"“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting around at the dark, slimy walls.",
7420,All three of them turned to stare into the darkness ahead.,

7425,"“Lumos!” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. “C’mon,” he said to Ron and",
7426,"Lockhart, and off they went, their footsteps slapping loudly on the wet floor.",
7427,The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance ahead. Their shadows,
7428,on the wet walls looked monstrous in the wandlight.,
7429,"“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously forward, “any sign of",
7430,"movement, close your eyes right away…”",
7431,"But the tunnel was quiet as the grave, and the first unexpected sound they heard was a",
7432,loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned out to be a rat’s skull. Harry lowered his,
7433,wand to look at the floor and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying,
7434,"very hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, Harry led the way",
7435,"forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel.",
7436,"“Harry — there’s something up there —” said Ron hoarsely, grabbing Harry’s shoulder.",
7437,"They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of something huge and curved,",
7438,lying right across the tunnel. It wasn’t moving.,
7439,"“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the other two. Lockhart’s hands were",
7440,"pressed over his eyes. Harry turned back to look at the thing, his heart beating so fast",t
7441,hurt.,
7442,"Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still see, Harry edged",
7443,"forward, his wand held high.",
7444,"The light slid over a gigantic snake skin, of a vivid, poisonous green, lying curled and",
7445,empty across the tunnel floor. The creature that had shed it must have been twenty feet,
7446,long at least.,
7447,"“Blimey,” said Ron weakly.",
7448,There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lockhart’s knees had given way.,
7449,"“Get up,” said Ron sharply, pointing his wand at Lockhart.",

7454,"Lockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron, knocking him to the ground.",
7455,"Harry jumped forward, but too late — Lockhart was straightening up, panting, Ron’s",
7456,wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face.,
7457,"“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take a bit of this skin back up to the",
7458,"school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your",
7459,minds at the sight of her mangled body — say good-bye to your memories!”,
7460,"He raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, “Obliviate!”",
7461,The wand exploded with the force of a small bomb. Harry flung his arms over his head,
7462,"and ran, slipping over the coils of snake skin, out of the way of great chunks of tunnel",
7463,"ceiling that were thundering to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing",
7464,at a solid wall of broken rock.,
7465,“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!”,
7466,“I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the rockfall. “I’m okay — this git’s not,
7467,though — he got blasted by the wand —”,
7468,There was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as though Ron had just kicked,
7469,Lockhart in the shins.,
7470,"“What now?” Ron’s voice said, sounding desperate. “We can’t get through — it’ll take",
7471,ages…”,
7472,Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had appeared in it. He had never,
7473,"tried to break apart anything as large as these rocks by magic, and now didn’t seem a",
7474,good moment to try — what if the whole tunnel caved in?,
7475,There was another thud and another “ow!” from behind the rocks. They were wasting,
7476,time. Ginny had already been in the Chamber of Secrets for hours… Harry knew there,
7477,was only one thing to do.,
7478,"“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll go on… If I’m not back in an",

7485,"seemed to be trying to keep his voice steady. “So you can — can get back through. And,",
7486,Harry —”,
7487,"“See you in a bit,” said Harry, trying to inject some confidence into his shaking voice",
7488,And he set off alone past the giant snake skin.,
7489,Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was gone. The tunnel turned,
7490,and turned again. Every nerve in Harry’s body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the,
7491,"tunnel to end, yet dreaded what he’d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept",
7492,"around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two entwined serpents",
7493,"were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting emeralds.",
7494,"Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to pretend these stone snakes",
7495,were real; their eyes looked strangely alive.,

7510,"beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill silence. Could the basilisk be lurking",
7511,"in a shadowy corner, behind a pillar? And where was Ginny?",
7512,He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every,
7513,"careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready",
7514,to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the,
7515,"stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach,",
7516,he thought he saw one stir.,
7517,"Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself",
7518,"loomed into view, standing against the back wall.",
7519,Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and,
7520,"monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard’s",
7521,"sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber",
7522,"floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red",
7523,hair.,
7524,"“Ginny!” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his knees. “Ginny — don’t be",
7525,"dead — please don’t be dead —” He flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny’s shoulders,",
7526,"and turned her over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were",
7527,"closed, so she wasn’t Petrified. But then she must be…",
7528,"“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately, shaking her. Ginny’s head lolled",
7529,hopelessly from side to side.,
7530,"“She won’t wake,” said a soft voice.",
7531,Harry jumped and spun around on his knees.,
7532,"A tall, black-haired boy was leaning against the nearest pillar, watching. He was",
7533,"strangely blurred around the edges, as though Harry were looking at him through a",
7534,misted window. But there was no mistaking him.,
7535,“Tom — Tom Riddle?”,

7542,"“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.”",
7543,"Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he",
7544,"stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen.",
7545,“Are you a ghost?” Harry said uncertainly.,
7546,"“A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary for fifty years.”",
7547,He pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying open there was the littl,
7548,"black diary Harry had found in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. For a second, Harry",
7549,wondered how it had got there — but there were more pressing matters to deal with.,
7550,"“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising Ginny’s head again. “We’ve got to get",

7560,"A smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He continued to stare at Harry, twirling t",e

7585,spilled all her secrets to an invisible stranger.”,
7586,“What are you talking about?” said Harry.,

7745,"“And that —” said Riddle, now eyeing the ragged thing that Fawkes had dropped,",
7746,“that’s the old school Sorting Hat —”,
7747,"So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at Harry’s feet.",
7748,"Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark chamber rang with it, as",
7749,though ten Riddles were laughing at once.,

7755,"brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?”",

7758,mounting.,
7759,"“To business, Harry,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly. “Twice — in your past, in my",
7760,future — we have met. And twice I failed to kill you. How did you survive? Tell me,
7761,"everything. The longer you talk,” he added softly, “the longer you stay alive.”",
7762,"Harry was thinking fast, weighing his chances. Riddle had the wand. He, Harry, had",
7763,"Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, neither of which would be much good in a duel. It looked",
7764,"bad, all right… but the longer Riddle stood there, the more life was dwindling out of",
7765,"Ginny… and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s outline was becoming",
7766,"clearer, more solid… If it had to be a fight between him and Riddle, better sooner than",
7767,later.,
7768,"“No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me,” said Harry abruptly. “I",
7769,don’t know myself. But I know why you couldn’t kill me. Because my mother died to save,
7770,"me. My common Muggle-born mother,” he added, shaking with suppressed rage. “She",
7771,"stopped you killing me. And I’ve seen the real you, I saw you last year. You’re a wreck.",
7772,"You’re barely alive. That’s where all your power got you. You’re in hiding. You’re ugly,",
7773,you’re foul —”,
7774,Riddle’s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. “So. Your mother died to,
7775,"save you. Yes, that’s a powerful countercharm. I can see now… there is nothing special",
7776,"about you, after all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after",
7777,"all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, raised by Muggles. Probably",
7778,the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself. We,
7779,"even look something alike… but after all, it was merely a lucky chance that saved you",
7780,from me. That’s all I wanted to know.”,

7819,He couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough to squint at what was going on.,
7820,"The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak trunk, had raised itself",

7823,"Fawkes was soaring around its head, and the basilisk was snapping furiously at him with",

7827,"into its face and saw that its eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been",
7828,"punctured by the phoenix; blood was streaming to the floor, and the snake was spitting",
7829,in agony.,

7919,He had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and there was silence. Silence,
7920,except for the steady drip drip of ink still oozing from the diary. The basilisk venom had,

8027,"For a moment there was silence as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and Lockhart stood in the",
8028,"doorway, covered in muck and slime and (in Harry’s case) blood. Then there was a",
8029,scream.,
8030,“Ginny!”,
8031,"It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the fire. She leapt to her",
8032,"feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both of them flung themselves on their",

8034,"Harry, however, was looking past them. Professor Dumbledore was standing by the",

8044,Then he started telling them everything. For nearly a quarter of an hour he spoke into,

8051,"the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last victim of the",
8052,"basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning Myrtle had been the victim, and",
8053,that the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets might be in her bathroom…,
8054,"“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, “so you found out",

8057,"So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, told them about Fawkes’s",
8058,timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He,
8059,had so far avoided mentioning Riddle’s diary — or Ginny. She was standing with her,
8060,"head against Mrs. Weasley’s shoulder, and tears were still coursing silently down her",
8061,cheeks. What if they expelled her? Harry thought in panic. Riddle’s diary didn’t work,
8062,anymore… How could they prove it had been he who’d made her do it all?,

8099,Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort.” He strode,

8101,"chocolate. I always find that cheers me up,” he added, twinkling kindly down at her. “You",
8102,will find that Madam Pomfrey is still awake. She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I,

8114,"deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?”",
8115,"“Certainly,” said Dumbledore.",
8116,"She left, and Harry and Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. What exactly had",

8125,Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine flowers and closed his mouth again.,
8126,“But one of us seems to be keeping mightily quiet about his part in this dangerous,
8127,"adventure,” Dumbledore added. “Why so modest, Gilderoy?”",
8128,Harry gave a start. He had completely forgotten about Lockhart. He turned and saw that,
8129,"Lockhart was standing in a corner of the room, still wearing his vague smile. When",
8130,"Dumbledore addressed him, Lockhart looked over his shoulder to see who he was",
8131,talking to.,

8143,"“Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!”",

8145,at Harry. “He’ll lend you one.”,
8146,"“Would you mind taking Professor Lockhart up to the infirmary, too?” Dumbledore said",

8151,"“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably nervous.",
8152,"“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said Dumbledore, eyes twinkling again. “You",

8172,speak Parseltongue…”,
8173,"“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly, “because Lord Voldemort",
8174,— who is the last remaining ancestor of Salazar Slytherin — can speak Parseltongue.,
8175,"Unless I’m much mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night he",

8183,"rare gift, Parseltongue — resourcefulness — determination — a certain disregard for",
8184,"rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting Hat placed you in",
8185,Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.”,
8186,"“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I asked not to go",
8187,in Slytherin…”,
8188,"“Exactly, “said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes you very different from",
8189,"Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our",
