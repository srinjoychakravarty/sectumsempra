111,CHAPTER ONE
112,THE OTHER MINISTER
113,I    t was nearing midnight and the Prime Minister was sitting
114,"alone in his office, reading a long memo that was slipping"
115,through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning be-
116,hind. He was waiting for a call from the President of a far distant
117,"country, and between wondering when the wretched man would"
118,"telephone, and trying to suppress unpleasant memories of what had"
119,"been a very long, tiring, and difficult week, there was not much"
120,space in his head for anything else. The more he attempted to focus
121,"on the print on the page before him, the more clearly the Prime"
122,Minister could see the gloating face of one of his political oppo-
123,nents. This particular opponent had appeared on the news that very
124,"day, not only to enumerate all the terrible things that had happened"
125,in the last week (as though anyone needed reminding) but also to
126,explain why each and every one of them was the government’s fault.
127,The Prime Minister’s pulse quickened at the very thought of
128,"these accusations, for they were neither fair nor true. How on earth"
129,  1  
130,CHAPTER ONE
131,was his government supposed to have stopped that bridge collaps-
132,ing? It was outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not
133,spending enough on bridges. The bridge was fewer than ten years
134,"old, and the best experts were at a loss to explain why it had"
135,"snapped cleanly in two, sending a dozen cars into the watery"
136,depths of the river below. And how dare anyone suggest that it was
137,lack of policemen that had resulted in those two very nasty and
138,well-publicized murders? Or that the government should have
139,somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the West Country that
140,had caused so much damage to both people and property? And was
141,"it his fault that one of his Junior Ministers, Herbert Chorley, had"
142,chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he was now going to be
143,spending a lot more time with his family?
144,"“A grim mood has gripped the country,” the opponent had con-"
145,"cluded, barely concealing his own broad grin."
146,"And unfortunately, this was perfectly true. The Prime Minister"
147,felt it himself; people really did seem more miserable than usual.
148,Even the weather was dismal; all this chilly mist in the middle of
149,"July. . . . It wasn’t right, it wasn’t normal. . . ."
150,"He turned over the second page of the memo, saw how much"
151,"longer it went on, and gave it up as a bad job. Stretching his arms"
152,above his head he looked around his office mournfully. It was a
153,"handsome room, with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash"
154,"windows, firmly closed against the unseasonable chill. With a slight"
155,"shiver, the Prime Minister got up and moved over to the window,"
156,looking out at the thin mist that was pressing itself against the
157,"glass. It was then, as he stood with his back to the room, that he"
158,heard a soft cough behind him.
159,"He froze, nose to nose with his own scared-looking reflection in"
160, 2  
161,THE OTHER MINISTER
162,the dark glass. He knew that cough. He had heard it before. He
163,turned very slowly to face the empty room.
164,"“Hello?” he said, trying to sound braver than he felt."
165,For a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that
166,"nobody would answer him. However, a voice responded at once, a"
167,"crisp, decisive voice that sounded as though it were reading a pre-"
168,pared statement. It was coming — as the Prime Minister had
169,known at the first cough — from the froglike little man wearing a
170,"long silver wig who was depicted in a small, dirty oil painting in the"
171,far corner of the room.
172,“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Urgent we meet. Kindly re-
173,"spond immediately. Sincerely, Fudge.”"
174,The man in the painting looked inquiringly at the Prime Minister.
175,"“Er,” said the Prime Minister, “listen. . . . It’s not a very good"
176,"time for me. . . . I’m waiting for a telephone call, you see . . . from"
177,the President of —”
178,"“That can be rearranged,” said the portrait at once. The Prime"
179,Minister’s heart sank. He had been afraid of that.
180,“But I really was rather hoping to speak —”
181,“We shall arrange for the President to forget to call. He will tele-
182,"phone tomorrow night instead,” said the little man. “Kindly re-"
183,spond immediately to Mr. Fudge.”
184,"“I . . . oh . . . very well,” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Yes,"
185,I’ll see Fudge.”
186,"He hurried back to his desk, straightening his tie as he went. He"
187,"had barely resumed his seat, and arranged his face into what he"
188,"hoped was a relaxed and unfazed expression, when bright green"
189,flames burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble man-
190,"telpiece. He watched, trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or"
191, 3 
192,CHAPTER ONE
193,"alarm, as a portly man appeared within the flames, spinning as fast"
194,"as a top. Seconds later, he had climbed out onto a rather fine an-"
195,"tique rug, brushing ash from the sleeves of his long pin-striped"
196,"cloak, a lime-green bowler hat in his hand."
197,"“Ah . . . Prime Minister,” said Cornelius Fudge, striding forward"
198,with his hand outstretched. “Good to see you again.”
199,"The Prime Minister could not honestly return this compliment,"
200,"so said nothing at all. He was not remotely pleased to see Fudge,"
201,"whose occasional appearances, apart from being downright alarm-"
202,"ing in themselves, generally meant that he was about to hear some"
203,"very bad news. Furthermore, Fudge was looking distinctly care-"
204,"worn. He was thinner, balder, and grayer, and his face had a crum-"
205,pled look. The Prime Minister had seen that kind of look in
206,"politicians before, and it never boded well."
207,"“How can I help you?” he said, shaking Fudge’s hand very briefly"
208,and gesturing toward the hardest of the chairs in front of the desk.
209,"“Difficult to know where to begin,” muttered Fudge, pulling up"
210,"the chair, sitting down, and placing his green bowler upon his"
211,"knees. “What a week, what a week . . .”"
212,"“Had a bad one too, have you?” asked the Prime Minister stiffly,"
213,hoping to convey by this that he had quite enough on his plate al-
214,ready without any extra helpings from Fudge.
215,"“Yes, of course,” said Fudge, rubbing his eyes wearily and look-"
216,ing morosely at the Prime Minister. “I’ve been having the same
217,"week you have, Prime Minister. The Brockdale Bridge . . . the"
218,Bones and Vance murders . . . not to mention the ruckus in the
219,West Country . . .”
220,"“You — er — your — I mean to say, some of your people"
221,"were — were involved in those — those things, were they?”"
222, 4 
223,THE OTHER MINISTER
224,Fudge fixed the Prime Minister with a rather stern look. “Of
225,"course they were,” he said. “Surely you’ve realized what’s going on?”"
226,“I . . .” hesitated the Prime Minister.
227,It was precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike
228,"Fudge’s visits so much. He was, after all, the Prime Minister and"
229,did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy.
230,"But of course, it had been like this from his very first meeting with"
231,Fudge on his very first evening as Prime Minister. He remembered
232,it as though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until
233,his dying day.
234,"He had been standing alone in this very office, savoring the tri-"
235,"umph that was his after so many years of dreaming and scheming,"
236,"when he had heard a cough behind him, just like tonight, and turned"
237,"to find that ugly little portrait talking to him, announcing that the"
238,Minister of Magic was about to arrive and introduce himself.
239,"Naturally, he had thought that the long campaign and the strain"
240,of the election had caused him to go mad. He had been utterly ter-
241,"rified to find a portrait talking to him, though this had been noth-"
242,ing to how he felt when a self-proclaimed wizard had bounced out
243,of the fireplace and shaken his hand. He had remained speechless
244,throughout Fudge’s kindly explanation that there were witches and
245,wizards still living in secret all over the world and his reassurances
246,that he was not to bother his head about them as the Ministry of
247,Magic took responsibility for the whole Wizarding community and
248,prevented the non-magical population from getting wind of them.
249,"It was, said Fudge, a difficult job that encompassed everything"
250,from regulations on responsible use of broomsticks to keeping
251,the dragon population under control (the Prime Minister remem-
252,bered clutching the desk for support at this point). Fudge had then
253, 5  
254,CHAPTER ONE
255,patted the shoulder of the still-dumbstruck Prime Minister in a fa-
256,therly sort of way.
257,"“Not to worry,” he had said, “it’s odds-on you’ll never see me"
258,again. I’ll only bother you if there’s something really serious going
259,"on our end, something that’s likely to affect the Muggles — the"
260,"non-magical population, I should say. Otherwise, it’s live and let"
261,"live. And I must say, you’re taking it a lot better than your prede-"
262,"cessor. He tried to throw me out the window, thought I was a hoax"
263,planned by the opposition.”
264,"At this, the Prime Minister had found his voice at last."
265,"“You’re — you’re not a hoax, then?”"
266,"It had been his last, desperate hope."
267,"“No,” said Fudge gently. “No, I’m afraid I’m not. Look.”"
268,And he had turned the Prime Minister’s teacup into a gerbil.
269,"“But,” said the Prime Minister breathlessly, watching his teacup"
270,"chewing on the corner of his next speech, “but why — why has no-"
271,body told me — ?”
272,“The Minister of Magic only reveals him- or herself to the Mug-
273,"gle Prime Minister of the day,” said Fudge, poking his wand back"
274,inside his jacket. “We find it the best way to maintain secrecy.”
275,"“But then,” bleated the Prime Minister, “why hasn’t a former"
276,Prime Minister warned me — ?”
277,"At this, Fudge had actually laughed."
278,"“My dear Prime Minister, are you ever going to tell anybody?”"
279,"Still chortling, Fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace,"
280,"stepped into the emerald flames, and vanished with a whooshing"
281,"sound. The Prime Minister had stood there, quite motionless, and re-"
282,"alized that he would never, as long as he lived, dare mention this en-"
283,"counter to a living soul, for who in the wide world would believe him?"
284, 6  
285,THE OTHER MINISTER
286,"The shock had taken a little while to wear off. For a time, he had"
287,tried to convince himself that Fudge had indeed been a hallucina-
288,tion brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election cam-
289,paign. In a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminders of this
290,"uncomfortable encounter, he had given the gerbil to his delighted"
291,niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait
292,of the ugly little man who had announced Fudge’s arrival. To the
293,"Prime Minister’s dismay, however, the portrait had proved impossi-"
294,"ble to remove. When several carpenters, a builder or two, an art"
295,"historian, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had all tried unsuc-"
296,"cessfully to prise it from the wall, the Prime Minister had aban-"
297,doned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing
298,remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office.
299,Occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his
300,"eye the occupant of the painting yawning, or else scratching his"
301,"nose; even, once or twice, simply walking out of his frame and leav-"
302,ing nothing but a stretch of muddy-brown canvas behind. How-
303,"ever, he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much,"
304,and always to tell himself firmly that his eyes were playing tricks on
305,him when anything like this happened.
306,"Then, three years ago, on a night very like tonight, the Prime"
307,Minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once
308,"again announced the imminent arrival of Fudge, who had burst out"
309,"of the fireplace, sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic."
310,Before the Prime Minister could ask why he was dripping all over
311,"the Axminster, Fudge had started ranting about a prison the Prime"
312,"Minister had never heard of, a man named “Serious” Black, some-"
313,"thing that sounded like “Hogwarts,” and a boy called Harry Potter,"
314,none of which made the remotest sense to the Prime Minister.
315, 7 
316,CHAPTER ONE
317,"“. . . I’ve just come from Azkaban,” Fudge had panted, tipping"
318,a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his
319,"pocket. “Middle of the North Sea, you know, nasty flight . . . the"
320,dementors are in uproar” — he shuddered — “they’ve never had
321,"a breakout before. Anyway, I had to come to you, Prime Minister."
322,Black’s a known Muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin You-
323,"Know-Who. . . . But of course, you don’t even know who You-"
324,Know-Who is!” He had gazed hopelessly at the Prime Minister for
325,"a moment, then said, “Well, sit down, sit down, I’d better fill you"
326,in. . . . Have a whiskey . . .”
327,The Prime Minister rather resented being told to sit down in his
328,"own office, let alone offered his own whiskey, but he sat neverthe-"
329,"less. Fudge pulled out his wand, conjured two large glasses full of"
330,"amber liquid out of thin air, pushed one of them into the Prime"
331,"Minister’s hand, and drew up a chair."
332,"Fudge had talked for more than an hour. At one point, he had"
333,refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece
334,"of parchment, which he had thrust into the Prime Minister’s"
335,"whiskey-free hand. When at last Fudge had stood up to leave, the"
336,Prime Minister had stood up too.
337,“So you think that . . .” He had squinted down at the name in
338,his left hand. “Lord Vol —”
339,“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named !” snarled Fudge.
340,“I’m sorry. . . . You think that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is
341,"still alive, then?”"
342,"“Well, Dumbledore says he is,” said Fudge, as he had fastened"
343,"his pin-striped cloak under his chin, “but we’ve never found him."
344,"If you ask me, he’s not dangerous unless he’s got support, so it’s"
345,"Black we ought to be worrying about. You’ll put out that warning,"
346, 8 
347,THE OTHER MINISTER
348,"then? Excellent. Well, I hope we don’t see each other again, Prime"
349,Minister! Good night.”
350,But they had seen each other again. Less than a year later a
351,harassed-looking Fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet
352,room to inform the Prime Minister that there had been a spot of
353,bother at the Kwidditch (or that was what it had sounded like)
354,"World Cup and that several Muggles had been “involved,” but that"
355,"the Prime Minister was not to worry, the fact that You-Know-"
356,Who’s Mark had been seen again meant nothing; Fudge was sure it
357,"was an isolated incident, and the Muggle Liaison Office was deal-"
358,ing with all memory modifications as they spoke.
359,"“Oh, and I almost forgot,” Fudge had added. “We’re importing"
360,"three foreign dragons and a sphinx for the Triwizard Tournament,"
361,"quite routine, but the Department for the Regulation and Control"
362,of Magical Creatures tells me that it’s down in the rule book that
363,we have to notify you if we’re bringing highly dangerous creatures
364,into the country.”
365,“I — what — dragons?” spluttered the Prime Minister.
366,"“Yes, three,” said Fudge. “And a sphinx. Well, good day to you.”"
367,The Prime Minister had hoped beyond hope that dragons and
368,"sphinxes would be the worst of it, but no. Less than two years later,"
369,"Fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again, this time with the news"
370,that there had been a mass breakout from Azkaban.
371,“A mass breakout?” repeated the Prime Minister hoarsely.
372,"“No need to worry, no need to worry!” shouted Fudge, already"
373,with one foot in the flames. “We’ll have them rounded up in no
374,time — just thought you ought to know!”
375,"And before the Prime Minister could shout, “Now, wait just one"
376,moment!” Fudge had vanished in a shower of green sparks.
377, 9  
378,CHAPTER ONE
379,"Whatever the press and the opposition might say, the Prime Min-"
380,"ister was not a foolish man. It had not escaped his notice that, de-"
381,"spite Fudge’s assurances at their first meeting, they were now seeing"
382,"rather a lot of each other, nor that Fudge was becoming more flus-"
383,tered with each visit. Little though he liked to think about the Min-
384,"ister of Magic (or, as he always called Fudge in his head, the Other"
385,"Minister), the Prime Minister could not help but fear that the next"
386,"time Fudge appeared it would be with graver news still. The sight,"
387,"therefore, of Fudge stepping out of the fire once more, looking di-"
388,sheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the Prime Minister
389,"did not know exactly why he was there, was about the worst thing"
390,that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week.
391,“How should I know what’s going on in the — er — Wizarding
392,community?” snapped the Prime Minister now. “I have a country
393,to run and quite enough concerns at the moment without —”
394,"“We have the same concerns,” Fudge interrupted. “The Brock-"
395,dale Bridge didn’t wear out. That wasn’t really a hurricane. Those
396,murders were not the work of Muggles. And Herbert Chorley’s
397,family would be safer without him. We are currently making
398,arrangements to have him transferred to St. Mungo’s Hospital for
399,Magical Maladies and Injuries. The move should be effected
400,tonight.”
401,“What do you . . . I’m afraid I . . . What?” blustered the Prime
402,Minister.
403,"Fudge took a great, deep breath and said, “Prime Minister, I am"
404,very sorry to have to tell you that he’s back. He-Who-Must-Not-
405,Be-Named is back.”
406,“Back? When you say ‘back’ . . . he’s alive? I mean —”
407,The Prime Minister groped in his memory for the details of that
408, 10  
409,THE OTHER MINISTER
410,"horrible conversation of three years previously, when Fudge had"
411,"told him about the wizard who was feared above all others, the wiz-"
412,ard who had committed a thousand terrible crimes before his mys-
413,terious disappearance fifteen years earlier.
414,"“Yes, alive,” said Fudge. “That is — I don’t know — is a man"
415,"alive if he can’t be killed? I don’t really understand it, and Dumble-"
416,"dore won’t explain properly — but anyway, he’s certainly got a"
417,"body and is walking and talking and killing, so I suppose, for the"
418,"purposes of our discussion, yes, he’s alive.”"
419,"The Prime Minister did not know what to say to this, but a per-"
420,sistent habit of wishing to appear well-informed on any subject
421,that came up made him cast around for any details he could re-
422,member of their previous conversations.
423,“Is Serious Black with — er — He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
424,"“Black? Black?” said Fudge distractedly, turning his bowler"
425,"rapidly in his fingers. “Sirius Black, you mean? Merlin’s beard, no."
426,Black’s dead. Turns out we were — er — mistaken about Black.
427,He was innocent after all. And he wasn’t in league with He-Who-
428,"Must-Not-Be-Named either. I mean,” he added defensively, spin-"
429,"ning the bowler hat still faster, “all the evidence pointed — we had"
430,"more than fifty eyewitnesses — but anyway, as I say, he’s dead."
431,"Murdered, as a matter of fact. On Ministry of Magic premises."
432,"There’s going to be an inquiry, actually. . . .”"
433,"To his great surprise, the Prime Minister felt a fleeting stab of"
434,"pity for Fudge at this point. It was, however, eclipsed almost im-"
435,"mediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient"
436,though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fire-

440,CHAPTER ONE
441,While the Prime Minister surreptitiously touched the wood of
442,"his desk, Fudge continued, “But Black’s by-the-by now. The point"
443,"is, we’re at war, Prime Minister, and steps must be taken.”"
444,“At war?” repeated the Prime Minister nervously. “Surely that’s a
445,little bit of an overstatement?”
446,“He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has now been joined by those
447,"of his followers who broke out of Azkaban in January,” said Fudge,"
448,speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that
449,"it was a lime-green blur. “Since they have moved into the open,"
450,"they have been wreaking havoc. The Brockdale Bridge — he did it,"
451,"Prime Minister, he threatened a mass Muggle killing unless I stood"
452,aside for him and —”
453,"“Good grief, so it’s your fault those people were killed and I’m"
454,having to answer questions about rusted rigging and corroded ex-
455,pansion joints and I don’t know what else!” said the Prime Minis-
456,ter furiously.
457,"“My fault!” said Fudge, coloring up. “Are you saying you would"
458,have caved in to blackmail like that?”
459,"“Maybe not,” said the Prime Minister, standing up and striding"
460,"about the room, “but I would have put all my efforts into catching"
461,the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity!”
462,“Do you really think I wasn’t already making every effort?” de-
463,manded Fudge heatedly. “Every Auror in the Ministry was — and
464,"is — trying to find him and round up his followers, but we happen"
465,"to be talking about one of the most powerful wizards of all time, a"
466,wizard who has eluded capture for almost three decades!”
467,“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in
468,"the West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising"
469,with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason
470, 12  
471,THE OTHER MINISTER
472,"for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public,"
473,almost worse than it being the government’s fault after all.
474,"“That was no hurricane,” said Fudge miserably."
475,"“Excuse me!” barked the Prime Minister, now positively stamp-"
476,"ing up and down. “Trees uprooted, roofs ripped off, lampposts"
477,"bent, horrible injuries —”"
478,"“It was the Death Eaters,” said Fudge. “He-Who-Must-Not-Be-"
479,Named’s followers. And . . . and we suspect giant involvement.”
480,The Prime Minister stopped in his tracks as though he had hit
481,an invisible wall. “What involvement?”
482,"Fudge grimaced. “He used giants last time, when he wanted to"
483,"go for the grand effect,” he said. “The Office of Misinformation"
484,"has been working around the clock, we’ve had teams of Obliviators"
485,out trying to modify the memories of all the Muggles who saw
486,"what really happened, we’ve got most of the Department for the"
487,Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures running around
488,"Somerset, but we can’t find the giant — it’s been a disaster.”"
489,“You don’t say!” said the Prime Minister furiously.
490,"“I won’t deny that morale is pretty low at the Ministry,” said"
491,"Fudge. “What with all that, and then losing Amelia Bones.”"
492,“Losing who?”
493,“Amelia Bones. Head of the Department of Magical Law En-
494,forcement. We think He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may have
495,"murdered her in person, because she was a very gifted witch and —"
496,and all the evidence was that she put up a real fight.”
497,"Fudge cleared his throat and, with an effort, it seemed, stopped"
498,spinning his bowler hat.
499,"“But that murder was in the newspapers,” said the Prime Minis-"
500,"ter, momentarily diverted from his anger. “Our newspapers. Amelia"
501, 13 
502,CHAPTER ONE
503,Bones . . . it just said she was a middle-aged woman who lived
504,"alone. It was a — a nasty killing, wasn’t it? It’s had rather a lot of"
505,"publicity. The police are baffled, you see.”"
506,"Fudge sighed. “Well, of course they are,” he said. “Killed in a"
507,"room that was locked from the inside, wasn’t she? We, on the other"
508,"hand, know exactly who did it, not that that gets us any further to-"
509,"ward catching him. And then there was Emmeline Vance, maybe"
510,you didn’t hear about that one —”
511,“Oh yes I did!” said the Prime Minister. “It happened just
512,"around the corner from here, as a matter of fact. The papers had a"
513,"field day with it, ‘breakdown of law and order in the Prime Minis-"
514,ter’s backyard —’ ”
515,"“And as if all that wasn’t enough,” said Fudge, barely listening to"
516,"the Prime Minister, “we’ve got dementors swarming all over the"
517,"place, attacking people left, right, and center. . . .”"
518,Once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unin-
519,"telligible to the Prime Minister, but he was wiser now."
520,"“I thought dementors guard the prisoners in Azkaban,” he said"
521,cautiously.
522,"“They did,” said Fudge wearily. “But not anymore. They’ve"
523,deserted the prison and joined He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I
524,won’t pretend that wasn’t a blow.”
525,"“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror,"
526,“didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happi-
527,ness out of people?”
528,“That’s right. And they’re breeding. That’s what’s causing all this
529,mist.”
530,"The Prime Minister sank, weak-kneed, into the nearest chair."
531,The idea of invisible creatures swooping through the towns and
532, 14  
533,THE OTHER MINISTER
534,"countryside, spreading despair and hopelessness in his voters, made"
535,him feel quite faint.
536,"“Now see here, Fudge — you’ve got to do something! It’s your"
537,responsibility as Minister of Magic!”
538,"“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Min-"
539,ister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole
540,Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a
541,fortnight. I’ve never known them so united in my whole term of
542,"office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile."
543,The Prime Minister was momentarily lost for words. Despite his
544,"indignation at the position into which he had been placed, he still"
545,rather felt for the shrunken-looking man sitting opposite him.
546,"“I’m very sorry,” he said finally. “If there’s anything I can do?”"
547,"“It’s very kind of you, Prime Minister, but there is nothing. I was"
548,sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent events and to in-
549,"troduce you to my successor. I rather thought he’d be here by now,"
550,"but of course, he’s very busy at the moment, with so much going on.”"
551,Fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wear-
552,"ing the long curly silver wig, who was digging in his ear with the"
553,"point of a quill. Catching Fudge’s eye, the portrait said, “He’ll be"
554,"here in a moment, he’s just finishing a letter to Dumbledore.”"
555,"“I wish him luck,” said Fudge, sounding bitter for the first time."
556,"“I’ve been writing to Dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight,"
557,"but he won’t budge. If he’d just been prepared to persuade the boy,"
558,"I might still be . . . Well, maybe Scrimgeour will have more success.”"
559,"Fudge subsided into what was clearly an aggrieved silence, but it"
560,"was broken almost immediately by the portrait, which suddenly"
561,"spoke in its crisp, official voice."
562,“To the Prime Minister of Muggles. Requesting a meeting.
563,  15  
564,CHAPTER ONE
565,"Urgent. Kindly respond immediately. Rufus Scrimgeour, Minister"
566,of Magic.”
567,"“Yes, yes, fine,” said the Prime Minister distractedly, and he"
568,barely flinched as the flames in the grate turned emerald green
569,"again, rose up, and revealed a second spinning wizard in their"
570,"heart, disgorging him moments later onto the antique rug."
571,"Fudge got to his feet and, after a moment’s hesitation, the Prime"
572,"Minister did the same, watching the new arrival straighten up, dust"
573,"down his long black robes, and look around."
574,"The Prime Minister’s first, foolish thought was that Rufus"
575,Scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion. There were streaks of
576,gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrows; he had
577,keen yellowish eyes behind a pair of wire-rimmed spectacles and a
578,"certain rangy, loping grace even though he walked with a slight"
579,limp. There was an immediate impression of shrewdness and
580,toughness; the Prime Minister thought he understood why the
581,Wizarding community preferred Scrimgeour to Fudge as a leader
582,in these dangerous times.
583,"“How do you do?” said the Prime Minister politely, holding out"
584,his hand.
585,"Scrimgeour grasped it briefly, his eyes scanning the room, then"
586,pulled out a wand from under his robes.
587,"“Fudge told you everything?” he asked, striding over to the door"
588,and tapping the keyhole with his wand. The Prime Minister heard
589,the lock click.
590,"“Er — yes,” said the Prime Minister. “And if you don’t mind, I’d"
591,rather that door remained unlocked.”
592,"“I’d rather not be interrupted,” said Scrimgeour shortly, “or"
593,"watched,” he added, pointing his wand at the windows, so that the"
594, 16   
595,THE OTHER MINISTER
596,"curtains swept across them. “Right, well, I’m a busy man, so let’s"
597,"get down to business. First of all, we need to discuss your security.”"
598,The Prime Minister drew himself up to his fullest height and
599,"replied, “I am perfectly happy with the security I’ve already got,"
600,thank you very —”
601,"“Well, we’re not,” Scrimgeour cut in. “It’ll be a poor lookout for"
602,the Muggles if their Prime Minister gets put under the Imperius
603,Curse. The new secretary in your outer office —”
604,"“I’m not getting rid of Kingsley Shacklebolt, if that’s what you’re"
605,"suggesting!” said the Prime Minister hotly. “He’s highly efficient,"
606,gets through twice the work the rest of them —”
607,"“That’s because he’s a wizard,” said Scrimgeour, without a flicker"
608,"of a smile. “A highly trained Auror, who has been assigned to you"
609,for your protection.”
610,"“Now, wait a moment!” declared the Prime Minister. “You can’t"
611,"just put your people into my office, I decide who works for me —”"
612,“I thought you were happy with Shacklebolt?” said Scrimgeour
613,coldly.
614,"“I am — that’s to say, I was —”"
615,"“Then there’s no problem, is there?” said Scrimgeour."
616,"“I . . . well, as long as Shacklebolt’s work continues to be . . . er"
617,". . . excellent,” said the Prime Minister lamely, but Scrimgeour"
618,barely seemed to hear him.
619,"“Now, about Herbert Chorley, your Junior Minister,” he contin-"
620,ued. “The one who has been entertaining the public by imperson-
621,ating a duck.”
622,“What about him?” asked the Prime Minister.
623,"“He has clearly reacted to a poorly performed Imperius Curse,” said"
624,"Scrimgeour. “It’s addled his brains, but he could still be dangerous.”"
625, 17  
626,CHAPTER ONE
627,“He’s only quacking!” said the Prime Minister weakly. “Surely a
628,bit of a rest . . . Maybe go easy on the drink . . .”
629,“A team of Healers from St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Mal-
630,adies and Injuries are examining him as we speak. So far he has at-
631,"tempted to strangle three of them,” said Scrimgeour. “I think it"
632,best that we remove him from Muggle society for a while.”
633,"“I . . . well . . . He’ll be all right, won’t he?” said the Prime Min-"
634,ister anxiously.
635,"Scrimgeour merely shrugged, already moving back toward the"
636,fireplace.
637,"“Well, that’s really all I had to say. I will keep you posted of de-"
638,"velopments, Prime Minister — or, at least, I shall probably be too"
639,"busy to come personally, in which case I shall send Fudge here. He"
640,has consented to stay on in an advisory capacity.”
641,"Fudge attempted to smile, but was unsuccessful; he merely"
642,looked as though he had a toothache. Scrimgeour was already rum-
643,maging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire
644,green. The Prime Minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for
645,"a moment, then the words he had fought to suppress all evening"
646,burst from him at last.
647,“But for heaven’s sake — you’re wizards! You can do magic !
648,Surely you can sort out — well — anything!”
649,Scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incred-
650,"ulous look with Fudge, who really did manage a smile this time as"
651,"he said kindly, “The trouble is, the other side can do magic too,"
652,Prime Minister.”
653,"And with that, the two wizards stepped one after the other into"
654,the bright green fire and vanished.

658,M              any miles away the chilly mist that had pressed against
659,the Prime Minister’s windows drifted over a dirty
660,"river that wound between overgrown, rubbish-strewn banks. An"
661,"immense chimney, relic of a disused mill, reared up, shadowy and"
662,ominous. There was no sound apart from the whisper of the black
663,water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk
664,down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fish-and-chip wrap-
665,pings in the tall grass.
666,"But then, with a very faint pop, a slim, hooded figure appeared"
667,"out of thin air on the edge of the river. The fox froze, wary eyes"
668,fixed upon this strange new phenomenon. The figure seemed to
669,"take its bearings for a few moments, then set off with light, quick"
670,"strides, its long cloak rustling over the grass."
671,"With a second and louder pop, another hooded figure materi-"
672,alized.
673,“Wait!”
674, 19  
675,CHAPTER TWO
676,"The harsh cry startled the fox, now crouching almost flat in the"
677,undergrowth. It leapt from its hiding place and up the bank. There
678,"was a flash of green light, a yelp, and the fox fell back to the"
679,"ground, dead."
680,The second figure turned over the animal with its toe.
681,"“Just a fox,” said a woman’s voice dismissively from under the"
682,"hood. “I thought perhaps an Auror — Cissy, wait!”"
683,"But her quarry, who had paused and looked back at the flash of"
684,"light, was already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen"
685,down.
686,“Cissy — Narcissa — listen to me —”
687,"The second woman caught the first and seized her arm, but the"
688,other wrenched it away.
689,"“Go back, Bella!”"
690,“You must listen to me!”
691,“I’ve listened already. I’ve made my decision. Leave me alone!”
692,"The woman named Narcissa gained the top of the bank, where"
693,"a line of old railings separated the river from a narrow, cobbled"
694,"street. The other woman, Bella, followed at once. Side by side they"
695,stood looking across the road at the rows and rows of dilapidated
696,"brick houses, their windows dull and blind in the darkness."
697,“He lives here?” asked Bella in a voice of contempt. “Here? In
698,this Muggle dunghill? We must be the first of our kind ever to set
699,foot —”
700,But Narcissa was not listening; she had slipped through a gap in
701,the rusty railings and was already hurrying across the road.
702,"“Cissy, wait!”"
703,"Bella followed, her cloak streaming behind, and saw Narcissa"
704,"darting through an alley between the houses into a second, almost"
705, 20 
706,SPINNER’S END
707,identical street. Some of the streetlamps were broken; the two
708,women were running between patches of light and deep darkness.
709,The pursuer caught up with her prey just as she turned another
710,"corner, this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swing-"
711,ing her around so that they faced each other.
712,"“Cissy, you must not do this, you can’t trust him —”"
713,"“The Dark Lord trusts him, doesn’t he?”"
714,"“The Dark Lord is . . . I believe . . . mistaken,” Bella panted,"
715,and her eyes gleamed momentarily under her hood as she looked
716,"around to check that they were indeed alone. “In any case, we were"
717,told not to speak of the plan to anyone. This is a betrayal of the
718,Dark Lord’s —”
719,"“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa, and she drew a wand from be-"
720,"neath her cloak, holding it threateningly in the other’s face. Bella"
721,merely laughed.
722,"“Cissy, your own sister? You wouldn’t —”"
723,"“There is nothing I wouldn’t do anymore!” Narcissa breathed, a"
724,"note of hysteria in her voice, and as she brought down the wand"
725,"like a knife, there was another flash of light. Bella let go of her sis-"
726,ter’s arm as though burned.
727,“Narcissa!”
728,"But Narcissa had rushed ahead. Rubbing her hand, her pursuer"
729,"followed again, keeping her distance now, as they moved deeper"
730,"into the deserted labyrinth of brick houses. At last, Narcissa hur-"
731,"ried up a street named Spinner’s End, over which the towering mill"
732,chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger. Her foot-
733,steps echoed on the cobbles as she passed boarded and broken win-
734,"dows, until she reached the very last house, where a dim light"
735,glimmered through the curtains in a downstairs room.
736, 21  
737,CHAPTER TWO
738,"She had knocked on the door before Bella, cursing under her"
739,"breath, had caught up. Together they stood waiting, panting"
740,"slightly, breathing in the smell of the dirty river that was carried to"
741,"them on the night breeze. After a few seconds, they heard move-"
742,ment behind the door and it opened a crack. A sliver of a man
743,"could be seen looking out at them, a man with long black hair"
744,parted in curtains around a sallow face and black eyes.
745,Narcissa threw back her hood. She was so pale that she seemed
746,to shine in the darkness; the long blonde hair streaming down her
747,back gave her the look of a drowned person.
748,"“Narcissa!” said the man, opening the door a little wider, so that"
749,the light fell upon her and her sister too. “What a pleasant sur-
750,prise!
751,"“Severus,” she said in a strained whisper. “May I speak to you?"
752,It’s urgent.”
753,“But of course.”
754,He stood back to allow her to pass him into the house. Her still-
755,hooded sister followed without invitation.
756,"“Snape,” she said curtly as she passed him."
757,"“Bellatrix,” he replied, his thin mouth curling into a slightly"
758,mocking smile as he closed the door with a snap behind them.
759,"They had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room, which had"
760,"the feeling of a dark, padded cell. The walls were completely cov-"
761,"ered in books, most of them bound in old black or brown leather;"
762,"a threadbare sofa, an old armchair, and a rickety table stood"
763,grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candle-filled lamp
764,"hung from the ceiling. The place had an air of neglect, as though it"
765,was not usually inhabited.
766,"Snape gestured Narcissa to the sofa. She threw off her cloak, cast"
767, 22 
768,SPINNER’S END
769,"it aside, and sat down, staring at her white and trembling hands"
770,clasped in her lap. Bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly. Dark as
771,"her sister was fair, with heavily lidded eyes and a strong jaw, she did"
772,not take her gaze from Snape as she moved to stand behind
773,Narcissa.
774,"“So, what can I do for you?” Snape asked, settling himself in the"
775,armchair opposite the two sisters.
776,"“We . . . we are alone, aren’t we?” Narcissa asked quietly."
777,"“Yes, of course. Well, Wormtail’s here, but we’re not counting"
778,"vermin, are we?”"
779,He pointed his wand at the wall of books behind him and with
780,"a bang, a hidden door flew open, revealing a narrow staircase upon"
781,which a small man stood frozen.
782,"“As you have clearly realized, Wormtail, we have guests,” said"
783,Snape lazily.
784,"The man crept, hunchbacked, down the last few steps and"
785,"moved into the room. He had small, watery eyes, a pointed nose,"
786,and wore an unpleasant simper. His left hand was caressing his
787,"right, which looked as though it was encased in a bright silver"
788,glove.
789,"“Narcissa!” he said, in a squeaky voice. “And Bellatrix! How"
790,charming —”
791,"“Wormtail will get us drinks, if you’d like them,” said Snape."
792,“And then he will return to his bedroom.”
793,Wormtail winced as though Snape had thrown something at
794,him.
795,"“I am not your servant!” he squeaked, avoiding Snape’s eye."
796,“Really? I was under the impression that the Dark Lord placed
797,you here to assist me.”
798,  23 
799,CHAPTER TWO
800,"“To assist, yes — but not to make you drinks and — and clean"
801,your house!”
802,"“I had no idea, Wormtail, that you were craving more dangerous"
803,"assignments,” said Snape silkily. “This can be easily arranged: I"
804,shall speak to the Dark Lord —”
805,“I can speak to him myself if I want to!”
806,"“Of course you can,” said Snape, sneering. “But in the mean-"
807,"time, bring us drinks. Some of the elf-made wine will do.”"
808,"Wormtail hesitated for a moment, looking as though he might"
809,"argue, but then turned and headed through a second hidden door."
810,They heard banging and a clinking of glasses. Within seconds he
811,"was back, bearing a dusty bottle and three glasses upon a tray. He"
812,dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their pres-
813,"ence, slamming the book-covered door behind him."
814,Snape poured out three glasses of bloodred wine and handed
815,"two of them to the sisters. Narcissa murmured a word of thanks,"
816,"whilst Bellatrix said nothing, but continued to glower at Snape."
817,"This did not seem to discompose him; on the contrary, he looked"
818,rather amused.
819,"“The Dark Lord,” he said, raising his glass and draining it."
820,The sisters copied him. Snape refilled their glasses. As Narcissa
821,"took her second drink she said in a rush, “Severus, I’m sorry to"
822,"come here like this, but I had to see you. I think you are the only"
823,one who can help me —”
824,"Snape held up a hand to stop her, then pointed his wand again"
825,"at the concealed staircase door. There was a loud bang and a squeal,"
826,followed by the sound of Wormtail scurrying back up the stairs.
827,"“My apologies,” said Snape. “He has lately taken to listening at"
828, 24  
829,SPINNER’S END
830,"doors, I don’t know what he means by it. . . . You were saying,"
831,Narcissa?”
832,"She took a great, shuddering breath and started again."
833,"“Severus, I know I ought not to be here, I have been told to say"
834,"nothing to anyone, but —”"
835,“Then you ought to hold your tongue!” snarled Bellatrix. “Par-
836,ticularly in present company!”
837,“ ‘Present company’?” repeated Snape sardonically. “And what
838,"am I to understand by that, Bellatrix?”"
839,"“That I don’t trust you, Snape, as you very well know!”"
840,Narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and cov-
841,ered her face with her hands. Snape set his glass down upon the
842,"table and sat back again, his hands upon the arms of his chair, smil-"
843,ing into Bellatrix’s glowering face.
844,"“Narcissa, I think we ought to hear what Bellatrix is bursting to"
845,"say; it will save tedious interruptions. Well, continue, Bellatrix,”"
846,said Snape. “Why is it that you do not trust me?”
847,"“A hundred reasons!” she said loudly, striding out from behind"
848,the sofa to slam her glass upon the table. “Where to start! Where
849,were you when the Dark Lord fell? Why did you never make any
850,attempt to find him when he vanished? What have you been doing
851,all these years that you’ve lived in Dumbledore’s pocket? Why did
852,you stop the Dark Lord procuring the Sorcerer’s Stone? Why
853,did you not return at once when the Dark Lord was reborn? Where
854,were you a few weeks ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy
855,"for the Dark Lord? And why, Snape, is Harry Potter still alive,"
856,when you have had him at your mercy for five years?”
857,"She paused, her chest rising and falling rapidly, the color high in"

860,"her cheeks. Behind her, Narcissa sat motionless, her face still hid-"
861,den in her hands.
862,Snape smiled.
863,"“Before I answer you — oh yes, Bellatrix, I am going to answer!"
864,You can carry my words back to the others who whisper behind my
865,"back, and carry false tales of my treachery to the Dark Lord! Before"
866,"I answer you, I say, let me ask a question in turn. Do you really"
867,think that the Dark Lord has not asked me each and every one of
868,"those questions? And do you really think that, had I not been able"
869,"to give satisfactory answers, I would be sitting here talking to you?”"
870,She hesitated.
871,"“I know he believes you, but . . .”"
872,“You think he is mistaken? Or that I have somehow hoodwinked
873,"him? Fooled the Dark Lord, the greatest wizard, the most accom-"
874,plished Legilimens the world has ever seen?”
875,"Bellatrix said nothing, but looked, for the first time, a little dis-"
876,comfited. Snape did not press the point. He picked up his drink
877,"again, sipped it, and continued, “You ask where I was when the"
878,"Dark Lord fell. I was where he had ordered me to be, at Hogwarts"
879,"School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, because he wished me to spy"
880,"upon Albus Dumbledore. You know, I presume, that it was on the"
881,Dark Lord’s orders that I took up the post?”
882,"She nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth,"
883,but Snape forestalled her.
884,“You ask why I did not attempt to find him when he vanished.
885,"For the same reason that Avery, Yaxley, the Carrows, Greyback, Lu-"
886,cius” — he inclined his head slightly to Narcissa — “and many
887,others did not attempt to find him. I believed him finished. I am
888,"not proud of it, I was wrong, but there it is. . . . If he had not"

891,"forgiven we who lost faith at that time, he would have very few fol-"
892,lowers left.”
893,"“He’d have me!” said Bellatrix passionately. “I, who spent many"
894,years in Azkaban for him!”
895,"“Yes, indeed, most admirable,” said Snape in a bored voice. “Of"
896,"course, you weren’t a lot of use to him in prison, but the gesture"
897,was undoubtedly fine —”
898,“Gesture!” she shrieked; in her fury she looked slightly mad.
899,"“While I endured the dementors, you remained at Hogwarts, com-"
900,fortably playing Dumbledore’s pet!”
901,"“Not quite,” said Snape calmly. “He wouldn’t give me the De-"
902,"fense Against the Dark Arts job, you know. Seemed to think it"
903,"might, ah, bring about a relapse . . . tempt me into my old ways.”"
904,"“This was your sacrifice for the Dark Lord, not to teach your fa-"
905,"vorite subject?” she jeered. “Why did you stay there all that time,"
906,Snape? Still spying on Dumbledore for a master you believed
907,dead?”
908,"“Hardly,” said Snape, “although the Dark Lord is pleased that I"
909,never deserted my post: I had sixteen years of information on
910,"Dumbledore to give him when he returned, a rather more useful"
911,welcome-back present than endless reminiscences of how unpleas-
912,ant Azkaban is. . . .”
913,“But you stayed —”
914,"“Yes, Bellatrix, I stayed,” said Snape, betraying a hint of impa-"
915,tience for the first time. “I had a comfortable job that I preferred to
916,"a stint in Azkaban. They were rounding up the Death Eaters, you"
917,know. Dumbledore’s protection kept me out of jail; it was most
918,convenient and I used it. I repeat: The Dark Lord does not com-
919,"plain that I stayed, so I do not see why you do."

921,CHAPTER TWO
922,"“I think you next wanted to know,” he pressed on, a little more"
923,"loudly, for Bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting, “why I"
924,stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer’s Stone. That is eas-
925,ily answered. He did not know whether he could trust me. He
926,"thought, like you, that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to"
927,"Dumbledore’s stooge. He was in a pitiable condition, very weak,"
928,sharing the body of a mediocre wizard. He did not dare reveal him-
929,self to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore
930,or the Ministry. I deeply regret that he did not trust me. He would
931,"have returned to power three years sooner. As it was, I saw only"
932,"greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and, I"
933,"admit, I did all I could to thwart him.”"
934,Bellatrix’s mouth twisted as though she had taken an unpleasant
935,dose of medicine.
936,"“But you didn’t return when he came back, you didn’t fly back to"
937,him at once when you felt the Dark Mark burn —”
938,“Correct. I returned two hours later. I returned on Dumble-
939,dore’s orders.”
940,"“On Dumbledore’s — ?” she began, in tones of outrage."
941,"“Think!” said Snape, impatient again. “Think! By waiting two"
942,"hours, just two hours, I ensured that I could remain at Hogwarts as a"
943,spy! By allowing Dumbledore to think that I was only returning
944,"to the Dark Lord’s side because I was ordered to, I have been able"
945,to pass information on Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix
946,"ever since! Consider, Bellatrix: The Dark Mark had been growing"
947,"stronger for months. I knew he must be about to return, all the Death"
948,Eaters knew! I had plenty of time to think about what I wanted to
949,"do, to plan my next move, to escape like Karkaroff, didn’t I?"
950,“The Dark Lord’s initial displeasure at my lateness vanished

953,"entirely, I assure you, when I explained that I remained faithful, al-"
954,"though Dumbledore thought I was his man. Yes, the Dark Lord"
955,"thought that I had left him forever, but he was wrong.”"
956,“But what use have you been?” sneered Bellatrix. “What useful
957,information have we had from you?”
958,"“My information has been conveyed directly to the Dark Lord,”"
959,said Snape. “If he chooses not to share it with you —”
960,"“He shares everything with me!” said Bellatrix, firing up at once."
961,"“He calls me his most loyal, his most faithful —”"
962,"“Does he?” said Snape, his voice delicately inflected to suggest"
963,"his disbelief. “Does he still, after the fiasco at the Ministry?”"
964,"“That was not my fault!” said Bellatrix, flushing. “The Dark"
965,"Lord has, in the past, entrusted me with his most precious — if"
966,Lucius hadn’t —”
967,“Don’t you dare — don’t you dare blame my husband!” said
968,"Narcissa, in a low and deadly voice, looking up at her sister."
969,"“There is no point apportioning blame,” said Snape smoothly."
970,"“What is done, is done.”"
971,"“But not by you!” said Bellatrix furiously. “No, you were once"
972,"again absent while the rest of us ran dangers, were you not, Snape?”"
973,"“My orders were to remain behind,” said Snape. “Perhaps you"
974,"disagree with the Dark Lord, perhaps you think that Dumbledore"
975,would not have noticed if I had joined forces with the Death Eaters
976,to fight the Order of the Phoenix? And — forgive me — you speak
977,"of dangers . . . you were facing six teenagers, were you not?”"
978,"“They were joined, as you very well know, by half of the Order"
979,"before long!” snarled Bellatrix. “And, while we are on the subject of"
980,"the Order, you still claim you cannot reveal the whereabouts"
981,"of their headquarters, don’t you?”"
982, 29  
983,CHAPTER TWO
984,“I am not the Secret-Keeper; I cannot speak the name of the
985,"place. You understand how the enchantment works, I think? The"
986,Dark Lord is satisfied with the information I have passed him on
987,"the Order. It led, as perhaps you have guessed, to the recent capture"
988,"and murder of Emmeline Vance, and it certainly helped dispose of"
989,"Sirius Black, though I give you full credit for finishing him off.”"
990,He inclined his head and toasted her. Her expression did not
991,soften.
992,"“You are avoiding my last question, Snape. Harry Potter. You"
993,could have killed him at any point in the past five years. You have
994,not done it. Why?”
995,“Have you discussed this matter with the Dark Lord?” asked
996,Snape.
997,"“He . . . lately, we . . . I am asking you, Snape!”"
998,"“If I had murdered Harry Potter, the Dark Lord could not have"
999,"used his blood to regenerate, making him invincible —”"
1000,“You claim you foresaw his use of the boy!” she jeered.
1001,“I do not claim it; I had no idea of his plans; I have already con-
1002,fessed that I thought the Dark Lord dead. I am merely trying to ex-
1003,"plain why the Dark Lord is not sorry that Potter survived, at least"
1004,until a year ago. . . .”
1005,“But why did you keep him alive?”
1006,“Have you not understood me? It was only Dumbledore’s pro-
1007,tection that was keeping me out of Azkaban! Do you disagree that
1008,murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me?
1009,But there was more to it than that. I should remind you that when
1010,Potter first arrived at Hogwarts there were still many stories circu-
1011,"lating about him, rumors that he himself was a great Dark wizard,"
1012,"which was how he had survived the Dark Lord’s attack. Indeed,"
1013, 30  
1014,SPINNER’S END
1015,many of the Dark Lord’s old followers thought Potter might be a
1016,"standard around which we could all rally once more. I was curious,"
1017,"I admit it, and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set"
1018,foot in the castle.
1019,"“Of course, it became apparent to me very quickly that he had"
1020,no extraordinary talent at all. He has fought his way out of a num-
1021,ber of tight corners by a simple combination of sheer luck and
1022,"more talented friends. He is mediocre to the last degree, though as"
1023,obnoxious and self-satisfied as was his father before him. I have
1024,"done my utmost to have him thrown out of Hogwarts, where I be-"
1025,"lieve he scarcely belongs, but kill him, or allow him to be killed in"
1026,front of me? I would have been a fool to risk it with Dumbledore
1027,close at hand.”
1028,“And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore
1029,has never suspected you?” asked Bellatrix. “He has no idea of your
1030,"true allegiance, he trusts you implicitly still?”"
1031,"“I have played my part well,” said Snape. “And you overlook"
1032,Dumbledore’s greatest weakness: He has to believe the best of peo-
1033,"ple. I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff,"
1034,"fresh from my Death Eater days, and he embraced me with open"
1035,"arms — though, as I say, never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts"
1036,"than he could help. Dumbledore has been a great wizard — oh yes,"
1037,"he has,” (for Bellatrix had made a scathing noise), “the Dark Lord"
1038,"acknowledges it. I am pleased to say, however, that Dumbledore is"
1039,growing old. The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him.
1040,He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are
1041,"slower than they once were. But through all these years, he has"
1042,"never stopped trusting Severus Snape, and therein lies my great"
1043,value to the Dark Lord.”

1048,turned to her sister.
1049,"“Now . . . you came to ask me for help, Narcissa?”"
1050,"Narcissa looked up at him, her face eloquent with despair."
1051,"“Yes, Severus. I — I think you are the only one who can help"
1052,"me, I have nowhere else to turn. Lucius is in jail and . . .”"
1053,She closed her eyes and two large tears seeped from beneath her

1055,"“The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it,” Narcissa con-"

1057,It is . . . very secret. But —”
1058,"“If he has forbidden it, you ought not to speak,” said Snape at"
1059,once. “The Dark Lord’s word is law.”
1060,Narcissa gasped as though he had doused her with cold water.
1061,Bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the
1062,house.
1063,“There!” she said triumphantly to her sister. “Even Snape says
1064,"so: You were told not to talk, so hold your silence!”"
1065,"But Snape had gotten to his feet and strode to the small window,"
1066,"peered through the curtains at the deserted street, then closed them"
1067,"again with a jerk. He turned around to face Narcissa, frowning."
1068,"“It so happens that I know of the plan,” he said in a low voice."
1069,"“I am one of the few the Dark Lord has told. Nevertheless, had I"

1071,great treachery to the Dark Lord.”

1078,"“Certainly,” said Snape. “But what help do you require, Nar-"
1079,cissa? If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change
1080,"his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.”"
1081,"“Severus,” she whispered, tears sliding down her pale cheeks."
1082,“My son . . . my only son . . .”
1083,"“Draco should be proud,” said Bellatrix indifferently. “The Dark"
1084,Lord is granting him a great honor. And I will say this for Draco:
1085,"He isn’t shrinking away from his duty, he seems glad of a chance to"
1086,"prove himself, excited at the prospect —”"
1087,"Narcissa began to cry in earnest, gazing beseechingly all the"
1088,while at Snape.
1089,“That’s because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store!
1090,"Why, Severus? Why my son? It is too dangerous! This is vengeance"

1092,Snape said nothing. He looked away from the sight of her tears
1093,"as though they were indecent, but he could not pretend not to hear"
1094,her.
1095,"“That’s why he’s chosen Draco, isn’t it?” she persisted. “To pun-"

1099,"“But he won’t succeed!” sobbed Narcissa. “How can he, when"

1109,"“The Dark Lord will not be persuaded, and I am not stupid"
1110,"enough to attempt it,” said Snape flatly. “I cannot pretend that the"
1111,Dark Lord is not angry with Lucius. Lucius was supposed to be in

1113,"failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain. Yes, the Dark Lord"
1114,"is angry, Narcissa, very angry indeed.”"
1115,"“Then I am right, he has chosen Draco in revenge!” choked"
1116,"Narcissa. “He does not mean him to succeed, he wants him to be"

1118,"When Snape said nothing, Narcissa seemed to lose what little"
1119,"self-restraint she still possessed. Standing up, she staggered to Snape"
1120,"and seized the front of his robes. Her face close to his, her tears"

1122,"instead of Draco, Severus. You would succeed, of course you would,"
1123,and he would reward you beyond all of us —”
1124,Snape caught hold of her wrists and removed her clutching

1126,"intends me to do it in the end, I think. But he is determined that"
1127,"Draco should try first. You see, in the unlikely event that Draco"
1128,"succeeds, I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer, ful-"

1130,"“In other words, it doesn’t matter to him if Draco is killed!”"
1131,"“The Dark Lord is very angry,” repeated Snape quietly. “He"

1252,A second newspaper lay beside the first. This one bore the
1253,headline:
1254,SCRIMGEOUR SUCCEEDS FUDGE
1255,Most of this front page was taken up with a large black-and-
1256,white picture of a man with a lionlike mane of thick hair and a
1257,rather ravaged face. The picture was moving — the man was wav-
1258,ing at the ceiling.
1259,"Rufus Scrimgeour, previously Head of the Auror"
1260,office in the Department of Magical Law Enforce-
1261,"ment, has succeeded Cornelius Fudge as Minister of"
1262,Magic. The appointment has largely been greeted
1263,"with enthusiasm by the Wizarding community,"
1264,though rumors of a rift between the new Minister
1265,"and Albus Dumbledore, newly reinstated Chief"
1266,"Warlock of the Wizengamot, surfaced within hours"
1267,of Scrimgeour taking office.
1268,Scrimgeour’s representatives admitted that he
1269,had met with Dumbledore at once upon taking
1270,"possession of the top job, but refused to com-"
1271,ment on the topics under discussion. Albus Dum-
1272,"bledore is known to (ctd. page 3, column 2)"
1273,"To the left of this paper sat another, which had been folded so"
1274,that a story bearing the title ministry guarantees students’
1275,safety was visible.
1276, 40  
1277,WILL AND WON’T
1278,"Newly appointed Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrim-"
1279,"geour, spoke today of the tough new measures"
1280,taken by his Ministry to ensure the safety of stu-
1281,dents returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft
1282,and Wizardry this autumn.
1283,"“For obvious reasons, the Ministry will not be"
1284,going into detail about its stringent new security
1285,"plans,” said the Minister, although an insider con-"
1286,firmed that measures include defensive spells and
1287,"charms, a complex array of countercurses, and a"
1288,small task force of Aurors dedicated solely to the
1289,protection of Hogwarts School.
1290,Most seem reassured by the new Minister’s
1291,tough stand on student safety. Said Mrs. Augusta
1292,"Longbottom, “My grandson, Neville — a good"
1293,"friend of Harry Potter’s, incidentally, who fought"
1294,the Death Eaters alongside him at the Ministry in
1295,June and —
1296,But the rest of this story was obscured by the large birdcage
1297,standing on top of it. Inside it was a magnificent snowy owl. Her
1298,"amber eyes surveyed the room imperiously, her head swiveling"
1299,occasionally to gaze at her snoring master. Once or twice she
1300,"clicked her beak impatiently, but Harry was too deeply asleep to"
1301,hear her.
1302,A large trunk stood in the very middle of the room. Its lid was
1303,open; it looked expectant; yet it was almost empty but for a residue
1304,"of old underwear, sweets, empty ink bottles, and broken quills that"
1305, 41   

1307,"coated the very bottom. Nearby, on the floor, lay a purple leaflet"
1308,emblazoned with the words:
1309,— issued on behalf of —
1310,The Ministry of Magic
1311,PROTECTING YOUR HOME AND FAMILY
1312,AGAINST DARK FORCES
1313,The Wizarding community is currently under threat from an orga-
1314,nization calling itself the Death Eaters. Observing the following
1315,"simple security guidelines will help protect you, your family, and"
1316,your home from attack.
1317,1. You are advised not to leave the house alone.
1318,2. Particular care should be taken during the hours of dark-
1319,"ness. Wherever possible, arrange to complete journeys be-"
1320,fore night has fallen.
1321,"3. Review the security arrangements around your house,"
1322,making sure that all family members are aware of emer-
1323,gency measures such as Shield and Disillusionment
1324,"Charms, and, in the case of underage family members,"
1325,Side-Along-Apparition.
1326,4. Agree on security questions with close friends and family
1327,so as to detect Death Eaters masquerading as others by use
1328,of the Polyjuice Potion (see page 2).
1329,"5. Should you feel that a family member, colleague, friend, or"
1330,"neighbor is acting in a strange manner, contact the Magi-"
1331,cal Law Enforcement Squad at once. They may have been
1332,put under the Imperius Curse (see page 4).
1333,  42 
1334,WILL AND WON’T
1335,6. Should the Dark Mark appear over any dwelling place or
1336,"other building, DO NOT ENTER, but contact the Auror"
1337,office immediately.
1338,7. Unconfirmed sightings suggest that the Death Eaters may
1339,now be using Inferi (see page 10). Any sighting of an In-
1340,"ferius, or encounter with same, should be reported to the"
1341,Ministry IMMEDIATELY.
1342,Harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an
1343,"inch or so, making his glasses still more lopsided, but he did not"
1344,"wake up. An alarm clock, repaired by Harry several years ago,"
1345,"ticked loudly on the sill, showing one minute to eleven. Beside it,"
1346,"held in place by Harry’s relaxed hand, was a piece of parchment"
1347,"covered in thin, slanting writing. Harry had read this letter so often"
1348,since its arrival three days ago that although it had been delivered
1349,"in a tightly furled scroll, it now lay quite flat."
1350,"Dear Harry,"
1351,"If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet"
1352,Drive this coming Friday at eleven P.M. to escort you to the
1353,"Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder"
1354,of your school holidays.
1355,"If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance"
1356,in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the
1357,Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you.
1358,Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to
1359,"see you this Friday,"
1360,"I am, yours most sincerely,"
1361,Albus Dumbledore
1362,  43  
1363,CHAPTER THREE
1364,"Though he already knew it by heart, Harry had been stealing"
1365,glances at this missive every few minutes since seven o’clock that
1366,"evening, when he had first taken up his position beside his bed-"
1367,"room window, which had a reasonable view of both ends of Privet"
1368,Drive. He knew it was pointless to keep rereading Dumbledore’s
1369,"words; Harry had sent back his “yes” with the delivering owl, as re-"
1370,"quested, and all he could do now was wait: Either Dumbledore was"
1371,"going to come, or he was not."
1372,But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true
1373,that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fort-
1374,night of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that
1375,something was going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore’s let-
1376,ter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from
1377,collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumble-
1378,"dore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to"
1379,face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again.
1380,The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to
1381,"shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage."
1382,The minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve
1383,"and, at that precise moment, the streetlamp outside the window"
1384,went out.
1385,Harry awoke as though the sudden darkness were an alarm.
1386,Hastily straightening his glasses and unsticking his cheek from the
1387,"glass, he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted"
1388,"down at the pavement. A tall figure in a long, billowing cloak was"
1389,walking up the garden path.
1390,"Harry jumped up as though he had received an electric shock,"
1391,"knocked over his chair, and started snatching anything and every-"
1392, 44  
1393,WILL AND WON’T
1394,thing within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk.
1395,"Even as he lobbed a set of robes, two spellbooks, and a packet of"
1396,"crisps across the room, the doorbell rang. Downstairs in the living"
1397,"room his Uncle Vernon shouted, “Who the blazes is calling at this"
1398,time of night?”
1399,Harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of
1400,trainers in the other. He had completely forgotten to warn the
1401,Dursleys that Dumbledore might be coming. Feeling both panicky
1402,"and close to laughter, he clambered over the trunk and wrenched"
1403,"open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say, “Good"
1404,evening. You must be Mr. Dursley. I daresay Harry has told you I
1405,would be coming for him?”
1406,"Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt"
1407,"halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught"
1408,him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible.
1409,"There in the doorway stood a tall, thin man with waist-length sil-"
1410,ver hair and beard. Half-moon spectacles were perched on his
1411,"crooked nose, and he was wearing a long black traveling cloak and"
1412,"a pointed hat. Vernon Dursley, whose mustache was quite as bushy"
1413,"as Dumbledore’s, though black, and who was wearing a puce dress-"
1414,"ing gown, was staring at the visitor as though he could not believe"
1415,his tiny eyes.
1416,"“Judging by your look of stunned disbelief, Harry did not warn"
1417,"you that I was coming,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. “However, let"
1418,us assume that you have invited me warmly into your house. It is
1419,unwise to linger overlong on doorsteps in these troubled times.”
1420,He stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door
1421,behind him.
1422, 45   
1423,CHAPTER THREE
1424,"“It is a long time since my last visit,” said Dumbledore, peering"
1425,"down his crooked nose at Uncle Vernon. “I must say, your agapan-"
1426,thus are flourishing.”
1427,Vernon Dursley said nothing at all. Harry did not doubt that
1428,"speech would return to him, and soon — the vein pulsing in his"
1429,uncle’s temple was reaching danger point — but something about
1430,Dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath. It
1431,"might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it"
1432,"might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that"
1433,here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully.
1434,"“Ah, good evening Harry,” said Dumbledore, looking up at him"
1435,through his half-moon glasses with a most satisfied expression.
1436,"“Excellent, excellent.”"
1437,These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as
1438,"far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say"
1439,“excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye.
1440,"“I don’t mean to be rude —” he began, in a tone that threatened"
1441,rudeness in every syllable.
1442,"“— yet, sadly, accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often,”"
1443,Dumbledore finished the sentence gravely. “Best to say nothing at
1444,"all, my dear man. Ah, and this must be Petunia.”"
1445,"The kitchen door had opened, and there stood Harry’s aunt,"
1446,"wearing rubber gloves and a housecoat over her nightdress, clearly"
1447,halfway through her usual pre-bedtime wipe-down of all the kitchen
1448,surfaces. Her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock.
1449,"“Albus Dumbledore,” said Dumbledore, when Uncle Vernon"
1450,"failed to effect an introduction. “We have corresponded, of course.”"
1451,Harry thought this an odd way of reminding Aunt Petunia that he
1452, 46  
1453,WILL AND WON’T
1454,"had once sent her an exploding letter, but Aunt Petunia did not"
1455,"challenge the term. “And this must be your son, Dudley?”"
1456,Dudley had that moment peered round the living room door.
1457,"His large, blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajamas"
1458,"looked oddly disembodied, his mouth gaping in astonishment and"
1459,"fear. Dumbledore waited a moment or two, apparently to see"
1460,"whether any of the Dursleys were going to say anything, but as the"
1461,silence stretched on he smiled.
1462,“Shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting
1463,room?
1464,Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him.
1465,"Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last"
1466,"few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in"
1467,the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings
1468,with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordi-
1469,narily out of place.
1470,"“Aren’t — aren’t we leaving, sir?” Harry asked anxiously."
1471,"“Yes, indeed we are, but there are a few matters we need to dis-"
1472,"cuss first,” said Dumbledore. “And I would prefer not to do so in"
1473,the open. We shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle’s hospitality
1474,only a little longer.”
1475,"“You will, will you?”"
1476,"Vernon Dursley had entered the room, Petunia at his shoulder,"
1477,and Dudley skulking behind them both.
1478,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore simply, “I shall.”"
1479,He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a ca-
1480,"sual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out"
1481,from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it
1482, 47   
1483,CHAPTER THREE
1484,in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to
1485,its original position.
1486,"“We may as well be comfortable,” said Dumbledore pleasantly."
1487,"As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand"
1488,was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been
1489,burned away.
1490,“Sir — what happened to your — ?”
1491,"“Later, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Please sit down.”"
1492,"Harry took the remaining armchair, choosing not to look at the"
1493,"Dursleys, who seemed stunned into silence."
1494,"“I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,”"
1495,"Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but the evidence so far sug-"
1496,gests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.”
1497,"A third twitch of the wand, and a dusty bottle and five glasses"
1498,appeared in midair. The bottle tipped and poured a generous mea-
1499,"sure of honey-colored liquid into each of the glasses, which then"
1500,floated to each person in the room.
1501,"“Madam Rosmerta’s finest oak-matured mead,” said Dumble-"
1502,"dore, raising his glass to Harry, who caught hold of his own and"
1503,"sipped. He had never tasted anything like it before, but enjoyed"
1504,"it immensely. The Dursleys, after quick, scared looks at one an-"
1505,"other, tried to ignore their glasses completely, a difficult feat, as"
1506,they were nudging them gently on the sides of their heads. Harry
1507,could not suppress a suspicion that Dumbledore was rather enjoy-
1508,ing himself.
1509,"“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, turning toward him, “a diffi-"
1510,"culty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us. By us,"
1511,I mean the Order of the Phoenix. But first of all I must tell you that
1512, 48  
1513,WILL AND WON’T
1514,Sirius’s will was discovered a week ago and that he left you every-
1515,thing he owned.”
1516,"Over on the sofa, Uncle Vernon’s head turned, but Harry did"
1517,"not look at him, nor could he think of anything to say except, “Oh."
1518,Right.”
1519,"“This is, in the main, fairly straightforward,” Dumbledore went"
1520,on. “You add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at
1521,"Gringotts, and you inherit all of Sirius’s personal possessions. The"
1522,slightly problematic part of the legacy —”
1523,“His godfather’s dead?” said Uncle Vernon loudly from the sofa.
1524,Dumbledore and Harry both turned to look at him. The glass of
1525,mead was now knocking quite insistently on the side of Vernon’s
1526,head; he attempted to beat it away. “He’s dead? His godfather?”
1527,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. He did not ask Harry why he had not"
1528,"confided in the Dursleys. “Our problem,” he continued to Harry,"
1529,"as if there had been no interruption, “is that Sirius also left you"
1530,"number twelve, Grimmauld Place.”"
1531,"“He’s been left a house?” said Uncle Vernon greedily, his small"
1532,"eyes narrowing, but nobody answered him."
1533,"“You can keep using it as headquarters,” said Harry. “I don’t"
1534,"care. You can have it, I don’t really want it.” Harry never wanted to"
1535,"set foot in number twelve, Grimmauld Place again if he could help"
1536,it. He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of
1537,"Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within"
1538,the place he had wanted so desperately to leave.
1539,"“That is generous,” said Dumbledore. “We have, however, va-"
1540,cated the building temporarily.”
1541,“Why?”
1542,  49  
1543,CHAPTER THREE
1544,"“Well,” said Dumbledore, ignoring the mutterings of Uncle"
1545,"Vernon, who was now being rapped smartly over the head by the"
1546,"persistent glass of mead, “Black family tradition decreed that"
1547,"the house was handed down the direct line, to the next male with the"
1548,name of ‘Black.’ Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger
1549,"brother, Regulus, predeceased him and both were childless. While"
1550,"his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house,"
1551,it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been
1552,set upon the place to ensure that it cannot be owned by anyone
1553,other than a pureblood.”
1554,"A vivid image of the shrieking, spitting portrait of Sirius’s"
1555,"mother that hung in the hall of number twelve, Grimmauld Place"
1556,"flashed into Harry’s mind. “I bet there has,” he said."
1557,"“Quite,” said Dumbledore. “And if such an enchantment exists,"
1558,then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest
1559,"of Sirius’s living relatives, which would mean his cousin, Bellatrix"
1560,Lestrange.”
1561,"Without realizing what he was doing, Harry sprang to his feet;"
1562,the telescope and trainers in his lap rolled across the floor. Bellatrix
1563,"Lestrange, Sirius’s killer, inherit his house?"
1564,"“No,” he said."
1565,"“Well, obviously we would prefer that she didn’t get it either,”"
1566,said Dumbledore calmly. “The situation is fraught with complica-
1567,tions. We do not know whether the enchantments we ourselves
1568,"have placed upon it, for example, making it Unplottable, will hold"
1569,now that ownership has passed from Sirius’s hands. It might be that
1570,Bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment. Naturally we
1571,had to move out until such time as we have clarified the position.”
1572,“But how are you going to find out if I’m allowed to own it?”
1573, 50   
1574,WILL AND WON’T
1575,"“Fortunately,” said Dumbledore, “there is a simple test.”"
1576,"He placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair, but"
1577,"before he could do anything else, Uncle Vernon shouted, “Will you"
1578,get these ruddy things off us?”
1579,Harry looked around; all three of the Dursleys were cowering
1580,with their arms over their heads as their glasses bounced up and
1581,"down on their skulls, their contents flying everywhere."
1582,"“Oh, I’m so sorry,” said Dumbledore politely, and he raised his"
1583,wand again. All three glasses vanished. “But it would have been
1584,"better manners to drink it, you know.”"
1585,It looked as though Uncle Vernon was bursting with any num-
1586,"ber of unpleasant retorts, but he merely shrank back into the cush-"
1587,"ions with Aunt Petunia and Dudley and said nothing, keeping his"
1588,small piggy eyes on Dumbledore’s wand.
1589,"“You see,” Dumbledore said, turning back to Harry and again"
1590,"speaking as though Uncle Vernon had not uttered, “if you have in-"
1591,"deed inherited the house, you have also inherited —”"
1592,"He flicked his wand for a fifth time. There was a loud crack, and"
1593,"a house-elf appeared, with a snout for a nose, giant bat’s ears, and"
1594,"enormous bloodshot eyes, crouching on the Dursleys’ shag carpet"
1595,and covered in grimy rags. Aunt Petunia let out a hair-raising
1596,shriek; nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory.
1597,"Dudley drew his large, bare, pink feet off the floor and sat with"
1598,"them raised almost above his head, as though he thought the crea-"
1599,"ture might run up his pajama trousers, and Uncle Vernon bel-"
1600,"lowed, “What the hell is that?”"
1601,"“Kreacher,” finished Dumbledore."
1602,"“Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t, Kreacher won’t!” croaked the"
1603,"house-elf, quite as loudly as Uncle Vernon, stamping his long,"
1604, 51 
1605,CHAPTER THREE
1606,gnarled feet and pulling his ears. “Kreacher belongs to Miss Bella-
1607,"trix, oh yes, Kreacher belongs to the Blacks, Kreacher wants his"
1608,"new mistress, Kreacher won’t go to the Potter brat, Kreacher won’t,"
1609,"won’t, won’t —”"
1610,"“As you can see, Harry,” said Dumbledore loudly, over Kreacher’s"
1611,"continued croaks of “won’t, won’t, won’t,” “Kreacher is showing a"
1612,certain reluctance to pass into your ownership.”
1613,"“I don’t care,” said Harry again, looking with disgust at the"
1614,"writhing, stamping house-elf. “I don’t want him.”"
1615,"“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”"
1616,“You would prefer him to pass into the ownership of Bellatrix
1617,Lestrange? Bearing in mind that he has lived at the headquarters of
1618,the Order of the Phoenix for the past year?”
1619,"“Won’t, won’t, won’t, won’t —”"
1620,Harry stared at Dumbledore. He knew that Kreacher could not
1621,"be permitted to go and live with Bellatrix Lestrange, but the idea of"
1622,"owning him, of having responsibility for the creature that had be-"
1623,"trayed Sirius, was repugnant."
1624,"“Give him an order,” said Dumbledore. “If he has passed into"
1625,"your ownership, he will have to obey. If not, then we shall have to"
1626,think of some other means of keeping him from his rightful mis-
1627,tress.”
1628,"“Won’t, won’t, won’t, WON’T !”"
1629,Kreacher’s voice had risen to a scream. Harry could think of
1630,"nothing to say, except, “Kreacher, shut up!”"
1631,It looked for a moment as though Kreacher was going to choke.
1632,"He grabbed his throat, his mouth still working furiously, his eyes"
1633,"bulging. After a few seconds of frantic gulping, he threw himself"
1634,face forward onto the carpet (Aunt Petunia whimpered) and beat
1635, 52  
1636,WILL AND WON’T
1637,"the floor with his hands and feet, giving himself over to a violent,"
1638,"but entirely silent, tantrum."
1639,"“Well, that simplifies matters,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “It"
1640,seems that Sirius knew what he was doing. You are the rightful
1641,"owner of number twelve, Grimmauld Place and of Kreacher.”"
1642,"“Do I — do I have to keep him with me?” Harry asked, aghast,"
1643,as Kreacher thrashed around at his feet.
1644,"“Not if you don’t want to,” said Dumbledore. “If I might make"
1645,"a suggestion, you could send him to Hogwarts to work in the"
1646,"kitchen there. In that way, the other house-elves could keep an eye"
1647,on him.”
1648,"“Yeah,” said Harry in relief, “yeah, I’ll do that. Er — Kreacher —"
1649,I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with
1650,the other house-elves.”
1651,"Kreacher, who was now lying flat on his back with his arms and"
1652,"legs in the air, gave Harry one upside-down look of deepest"
1653,"loathing and, with another loud crack, vanished."
1654,"“Good,” said Dumbledore. “There is also the matter of the hip-"
1655,"pogriff, Buckbeak. Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius"
1656,"died, but Buckbeak is yours now, so if you would prefer to make"
1657,different arrangements —”
1658,"“No,” said Harry at once, “he can stay with Hagrid. I think"
1659,Buckbeak would prefer that.”
1660,"“Hagrid will be delighted,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “He was"
1661,"thrilled to see Buckbeak again. Incidentally, we have decided, in"
1662,"the interests of Buckbeak’s safety, to rechristen him ‘Witherwings’"
1663,"for the time being, though I doubt that the Ministry would ever"
1664,"guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death. Now,"
1665,"Harry, is your trunk packed?”"

1668,“Erm . . .”
1669,“Doubtful that I would turn up?” Dumbledore suggested
1670,shrewdly.
1671,"“I’ll just go and — er — finish off,” said Harry hastily, hurrying"
1672,to pick up his fallen telescope and trainers.
1673,It took him a little over ten minutes to track down everything he
1674,needed; at last he had managed to extract his Invisibility Cloak
1675,"from under the bed, screwed the top back on his jar of color-"
1676,"change ink, and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron."
1677,"Then, heaving his trunk in one hand and holding Hedwig’s cage in"
1678,"the other, he made his way back downstairs."
1679,He was disappointed to discover that Dumbledore was not wait-
1680,"ing in the hall, which meant that he had to return to the living"
1681,room.
1682,"Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, appar-"
1683,"ently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold"
1684,"custard, and Harry did not dare look at the Dursleys as he said,"
1685,“Professor — I’m ready now.”
1686,"“Good,” said Dumbledore. “Just one last thing, then.” And he"
1687,turned to speak to the Dursleys once more.
1688,"“As you will no doubt be aware, Harry comes of age in a year’s"
1689,time —”
1690,"“No,” said Aunt Petunia, speaking for the first time since Dum-"
1691,bledore’s arrival.
1692,“I’m sorry?” said Dumbledore politely.
1693,"“No, he doesn’t. He’s a month younger than Dudley, and Dudders"
1694,doesn’t turn eighteen until the year after next.”
1695,"“Ah,” said Dumbledore pleasantly, “but in the Wizarding world,"
1696,we come of age at seventeen.”

1698,WILL AND WON’T
1699,"Uncle Vernon muttered, “Preposterous,” but Dumbledore ig-"
1700,nored him.
1701,"“Now, as you already know, the wizard called Lord Voldemort"
1702,has returned to this country. The Wizarding community is cur-
1703,"rently in a state of open warfare. Harry, whom Lord Voldemort has"
1704,"already attempted to kill on a number of occasions, is in even"
1705,greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your
1706,"doorstep fifteen years ago, with a letter explaining about his par-"
1707,ents’ murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him
1708,as though he were your own.”
1709,"Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and"
1710,"calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of"
1711,chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very
1712,slightly closer together.
1713,“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a
1714,son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your
1715,hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the
1716,appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sit-
1717,ting between you.”
1718,Both Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked around instinc-
1719,"tively, as though expecting to see someone other than Dudley"
1720,squeezed between them.
1721,“Us — mistreat Dudders? What d’you — ?” began Uncle Ver-
1722,"non furiously, but Dumbledore raised his finger for silence, a si-"
1723,lence which fell as though he had struck Uncle Vernon dumb.
1724,“The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has pow-
1725,erful protection while he can still call this house ‘home.’ However
1726,"miserable he has been here, however unwelcome, however badly"
1727,"treated, you have at least, grudgingly, allowed him houseroom. This"
1728, 55  
1729,CHAPTER THREE
1730,magic will cease to operate the moment that Harry turns seventeen;
1731,"in other words, at the moment he becomes a man. I ask only this:"
1732,"that you allow Harry to return, once more, to this house, before his"
1733,"seventeenth birthday, which will ensure that the protection contin-"
1734,ues until that time.”
1735,None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning
1736,"slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever"
1737,been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something
1738,"stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed."
1739,"“Well, Harry . . . time for us to be off,” said Dumbledore at last,"
1740,standing up and straightening his long black cloak. “Until we meet
1741,"again,” he said to the Dursleys, who looked as though that moment"
1742,"could wait forever as far as they were concerned, and after doffing"
1743,"his hat, he swept from the room."
1744,"“Bye,” said Harry hastily to the Dursleys, and followed Dum-"
1745,"bledore, who paused beside Harry’s trunk, upon which Hedwig’s"
1746,cage was perched.
1747,"“We do not want to be encumbered by these just now,” he said,"
1748,pulling out his wand again. “I shall send them to the Burrow to
1749,"await us there. However, I would like you to bring your Invisibility"
1750,Cloak . . . just in case.”
1751,"Harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty,"
1752,trying not to show Dumbledore the mess within. When he had
1753,"stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket, Dumbledore waved"
1754,"his wand and the trunk, cage, and Hedwig vanished. Dumbledore"
1755,"then waved his wand again, and the front door opened onto cool,"
1756,misty darkness.
1757,"“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that"
1758,"flighty temptress, adventure.”"

1762,D       espite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of
1763,the past few days hoping desperately that Dumbledore
1764,"would indeed come to fetch him, Harry felt distinctly awkward as"
1765,they set off down Privet Drive together. He had never had a proper
1766,conversation with the headmaster outside of Hogwarts before;
1767,there was usually a desk between them. The memory of their last
1768,"face-to-face encounter kept intruding too, and it rather heightened"
1769,Harry’s sense of embarrassment; he had shouted a lot on that occa-
1770,"sion, not to mention done his best to smash several of Dumble-"
1771,dore’s most prized possessions.
1772,"Dumbledore, however, seemed completely relaxed."
1773,"“Keep your wand at the ready, Harry,” he said brightly."
1774,"“But I thought I’m not allowed to use magic outside school, sir?”"
1775,"“If there is an attack,” said Dumbledore, “I give you permission"
1776,"to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you. However,"
1777,I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight.”
1778, 57 
1779,CHAPTER FOUR
1780,"“Why not, sir?”"
1781,"“You are with me,” said Dumbledore simply. “This will do,"
1782,Harry.”
1783,He came to an abrupt halt at the end of Privet Drive.
1784,"“You have not, of course, passed your Apparition Test,” he said."
1785,"“No,” said Harry. “I thought you had to be seventeen?”"
1786,"“You do,” said Dumbledore. “So you will need to hold on to my"
1787,"arm very tightly. My left, if you don’t mind — as you have noticed,"
1788,my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment.”
1789,Harry gripped Dumbledore’s proffered forearm.
1790,"“Very good,” said Dumbledore. “Well, here we go.”"
1791,Harry felt Dumbledore’s arm twist away from him and redou-
1792,"bled his grip; the next thing he knew, everything went black; he"
1793,was being pressed very hard from all directions; he could not
1794,"breathe, there were iron bands tightening around his chest; his eye-"
1795,balls were being forced back into his head; his eardrums were being
1796,pushed deeper into his skull and then —
1797,He gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his
1798,streaming eyes. He felt as though he had just been forced through
1799,a very tight rubber tube. It was a few seconds before he realized that
1800,Privet Drive had vanished. He and Dumbledore were now stand-
1801,"ing in what appeared to be a deserted village square, in the center"
1802,of which stood an old war memorial and a few benches. His com-
1803,"prehension catching up with his senses, Harry realized that he had"
1804,just Apparated for the first time in his life.
1805,"“Are you all right?” asked Dumbledore, looking down at him so-"
1806,licitously. “The sensation does take some getting used to.”
1807,"“I’m fine,” said Harry, rubbing his ears, which felt as though"
1808, 58  
1809,HORACE SLUGHORN
1810,they had left Privet Drive rather reluctantly. “But I think I might
1811,prefer brooms. . . .”
1812,"Dumbledore smiled, drew his traveling cloak a little more"
1813,"tightly around his neck, and said, “This way.”"
1814,"He set off at a brisk pace, past an empty inn and a few houses."
1815,"According to a clock on a nearby church, it was almost midnight."
1816,"“So tell me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “Your scar . . . has it been"
1817,hurting at all?”
1818,Harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed
1819,the lightning-shaped mark.
1820,"“No,” he said, “and I’ve been wondering about that. I thought it"
1821,would be burning all the time now Voldemort’s getting so power-
1822,ful again.”
1823,He glanced up at Dumbledore and saw that he was wearing a
1824,satisfied expression.
1825,"“I, on the other hand, thought otherwise,” said Dumbledore."
1826,“Lord Voldemort has finally realized the dangerous access to his
1827,thoughts and feelings you have been enjoying. It appears that he is
1828,now employing Occlumency against you.”
1829,"“Well, I’m not complaining,” said Harry, who missed neither"
1830,the disturbing dreams nor the startling flashes of insight into
1831,Voldemort’s mind.
1832,"They turned a corner, passing a telephone box and a bus shelter."
1833,Harry looked sideways at Dumbledore again. “Professor?”
1834,“Harry?”
1835,“Er — where exactly are we?”
1836,"“This, Harry, is the charming village of Budleigh Babberton.”"
1837,“And what are we doing here?”
1838, 59  
1839,CHAPTER FOUR
1840,"“Ah yes, of course, I haven’t told you,” said Dumbledore. “Well,"
1841,I have lost count of the number of times I have said this in recent
1842,"years, but we are, once again, one member of staff short. We are"
1843,here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retire-
1844,ment and return to Hogwarts.”
1845,"“How can I help with that, sir?”"
1846,"“Oh, I think we’ll find a use for you,” said Dumbledore vaguely."
1847,"“Left here, Harry.”"
1848,"They proceeded up a steep, narrow street lined with houses. All"
1849,the windows were dark. The odd chill that had lain over Privet
1850,"Drive for two weeks persisted here too. Thinking of dementors,"
1851,Harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassur-
1852,ingly in his pocket.
1853,"“Professor, why couldn’t we just Apparate directly into your old"
1854,colleague’s house?”
1855,“Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front
1856,"door,” said Dumbledore. “Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow"
1857,"wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. In any case, most"
1858,Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Ap-
1859,"parators. At Hogwarts, for instance —”"
1860,“— you can’t Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or
1861,"grounds,” said Harry quickly. “Hermione Granger told me.”"
1862,“And she is quite right. We turn left again.”
1863,The church clock chimed midnight behind them. Harry won-
1864,dered why Dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old
1865,"colleague so late, but now that conversation had been established,"
1866,he had more pressing questions to ask.
1867,"“Sir, I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked. . . .”"
1868,"“Correct,” said Dumbledore, now turning up a steep side street."
1869, 60  

1871,"“He has been replaced, as I am sure you also saw, by Rufus Scrim-"
1872,"geour, who used to be Head of the Auror office.”"
1873,“Is he . . . Do you think he’s good?” asked Harry.
1874,"“An interesting question,” said Dumbledore. “He is able, cer-"
1875,tainly. A more decisive and forceful personality than Cornelius.”
1876,"“Yes, but I meant —”"
1877,"“I know what you meant. Rufus is a man of action and, having"
1878,"fought Dark wizards for most of his working life, does not under-"
1879,estimate Lord Voldemort.”
1880,"Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not say anything about the"
1881,"disagreement with Scrimgeour that the Daily Prophet had reported,"
1882,"and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject, so he changed"
1883,it. “And . . . sir . . . I saw about Madam Bones.”
1884,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore quietly. “A terrible loss. She was a great"
1885,"witch. Just up here, I think — ouch.”"
1886,He had pointed with his injured hand.
1887,"“Professor, what happened to your — ?”"
1888,"“I have no time to explain now,” said Dumbledore. “It is a"
1889,"thrilling tale, I wish to do it justice.”"
1890,"He smiled at Harry, who understood that he was not being"
1891,"snubbed, and that he had permission to keep asking questions."
1892,"“Sir — I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl, about security"
1893,measures we should all take against the Death Eaters. . . .”
1894,"“Yes, I received one myself,” said Dumbledore, still smiling."
1895,“Did you find it useful?”
1896,“Not really.”
1897,"“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is"
1898,"my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor"
1899,Dumbledore and not an impostor.”
1900, 61 
1901,CHAPTER FOUR
1902,"“I didn’t . . .” Harry began, not entirely sure whether he was be-"
1903,ing reprimanded or not.
1904,"“For future reference, Harry, it is raspberry . . . although of"
1905,"course, if I were a Death Eater, I would have been sure to research"
1906,my own jam preferences before impersonating myself.”
1907,"“Er . . . right,” said Harry. “Well, on that leaflet, it said some-"
1908,thing about Inferi. What exactly are they? The leaflet wasn’t very
1909,clear.”
1910,"“They are corpses,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Dead bodies that"
1911,have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard’s bidding. Inferi have not
1912,"been seen for a long time, however, not since Voldemort was last"
1913,"powerful. . . . He killed enough people to make an army of them,"
1914,"of course. This is the place, Harry, just here. . . .”"
1915,"They were nearing a small, neat stone house set in its own gar-"
1916,den. Harry was too busy digesting the horrible idea of Inferi to
1917,"have much attention left for anything else, but as they reached the"
1918,"front gate, Dumbledore stopped dead and Harry walked into him."
1919,"“Oh dear. Oh dear, dear, dear.”"
1920,Harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and
1921,felt his heart sink. The front door was hanging off its hinges.
1922,Dumbledore glanced up and down the street. It seemed quite
1923,deserted.
1924,"“Wand out and follow me, Harry,” he said quietly."
1925,He opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the gar-
1926,"den path, Harry at his heels, then pushed the front door very slowly,"
1927,his wand raised and at the ready.
1928,“Lumos.”

1933,"nated wand aloft, Dumbledore walked into the sitting room with"
1934,Harry right behind him.
1935,A scene of total devastation met their eyes. A grandfather clock
1936,"lay splintered at their feet, its face cracked, its pendulum lying a lit-"
1937,"tle farther away like a dropped sword. A piano was on its side, its"
1938,keys strewn across the floor. The wreckage of a fallen chandelier
1939,"glittered nearby. Cushions lay deflated, feathers oozing from slashes"
1940,in their sides; fragments of glass and china lay like powder over
1941,"everything. Dumbledore raised his wand even higher, so that its"
1942,"light was thrown upon the walls, where something darkly red and"
1943,glutinous was spattered over the wallpaper. Harry’s small intake of
1944,breath made Dumbledore look around.
1945,"“Not pretty, is it?” he said heavily. “Yes, something horrible has"
1946,happened here.”
1947,"Dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room, scru-"
1948,"tinizing the wreckage at his feet. Harry followed, gazing around,"
1949,half-scared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the pi-
1950,"ano or the overturned sofa, but there was no sign of a body."
1951,"“Maybe there was a fight and — and they dragged him off, Pro-"
1952,"fessor?” Harry suggested, trying not to imagine how badly"
1953,wounded a man would have to be to leave those stains spattered
1954,halfway up the walls.
1955,"“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore quietly, peering behind an"
1956,overstuffed armchair lying on its side.
1957,“You mean he’s — ?”
1958,“Still here somewhere? Yes.”
1959,"And without warning, Dumbledore swooped, plunging the tip of"
1960,"his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair, which yelled,"
1961,“Ouch!”

1963,CHAPTER FOUR
1964,"“Good evening, Horace,” said Dumbledore, straightening up"
1965,again.
1966,Harry’s jaw dropped. Where a split second before there had been
1967,"an armchair, there now crouched an enormously fat, bald, old man"
1968,who was massaging his lower belly and squinting up at Dumble-
1969,dore with an aggrieved and watery eye.
1970,"“There was no need to stick the wand in that hard,” he said"
1971,"gruffly, clambering to his feet. “It hurt.”"
1972,"The wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate, his prominent eyes,"
1973,"his enormous, silver, walruslike mustache, and the highly polished"
1974,buttons on the maroon velvet jacket he was wearing over a pair of
1975,lilac silk pajamas. The top of his head barely reached Dumbledore’s
1976,chin.
1977,"“What gave it away?” he grunted as he staggered to his feet, still"
1978,rubbing his lower belly. He seemed remarkably unabashed for a
1979,man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair.
1980,"“My dear Horace,” said Dumbledore, looking amused, “if the"
1981,"Death Eaters really had come to call, the Dark Mark would have"
1982,been set over the house.”
1983,The wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead.
1984,"“The Dark Mark,” he muttered. “Knew there was something"
1985,". . . ah well. Wouldn’t have had time anyway, I’d only just put the"
1986,finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room.”
1987,He heaved a great sigh that made the ends of his mustache
1988,flutter.
1989,“Would you like my assistance clearing up?” asked Dumbledore
1990,politely.
1991,"“Please,” said the other."

1994,"They stood back to back, the tall thin wizard and the short"

1997,The furniture flew back to its original places; ornaments re-
1998,"formed in midair, feathers zoomed into their cushions; torn books"

2004,"“What kind of blood was that, incidentally?” asked Dumbledore"

2007,"“On the walls? Dragon,” shouted the wizard called Horace, as,"
2008,"with a deafening grinding and tinkling, the chandelier screwed it-"

2010,"There was a final plunk from the piano, and silence."
2011,"“Yes, dragon,” repeated the wizard conversationally. “My last"
2012,"bottle, and prices are sky-high at the moment. Still, it might be"
2013,reusable.”
2014,He stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a
2015,"sideboard and held it up to the light, examining the thick liquid"
2016,within.
2017,“Hmm. Bit dusty.”
2018,He set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed. It was then
2019,that his gaze fell upon Harry.

2027,"Slughorn turned on Dumbledore, his expression shrewd. “So"

2037,"not unlike the one that Slughorn had so recently impersonated,"
2038,which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly
2039,glowing oil lamp. Harry took the seat with the distinct impression
2040,"that Dumbledore, for some reason, wanted to keep him as visible"
2041,"as possible. Certainly when Slughorn, who had been busy with de-"

2054,"Rheumatism too. Can’t move like I used to. Well, that’s to be ex-"
2055,pected. Old age. Fatigue.”
2056,“And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a
2057,"welcome for us at such short notice,” said Dumbledore. “You can’t"
2058,have had more than three minutes’ warning?”
2059,"Slughorn said, half irritably, half proudly, “Two. Didn’t hear my"
2060,"Intruder Charm go off, I was taking a bath. Still,” he added sternly,"
2061,"seeming to pull himself back together again, “the fact remains that"
2062,"I’m an old man, Albus. A tired old man who’s earned the right to a"
2063,quiet life and a few creature comforts.”
2064,"He certainly had those, thought Harry, looking around the"
2065,"room. It was stuffy and cluttered, yet nobody could say it was un-"
2066,"comfortable; there were soft chairs and footstools, drinks and"
2067,"books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. If Harry had not"
2068,"known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old"
2069,lady.
2070,"“You’re not yet as old as I am, Horace,” said Dumbledore."
2071,"“Well, maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself,”"
2072,said Slughorn bluntly. His pale gooseberry eyes had found Dum-
2073,"bledore’s injured hand. “Reactions not what they were, I see.”"
2074,"“You’re quite right,” said Dumbledore serenely, shaking back his"
2075,sleeve to reveal the tips of those burned and blackened fingers; the
2076,sight of them made the back of Harry’s neck prickle unpleasantly.
2077,“I am undoubtedly slower than I was. But on the other hand . . .”
2078,"He shrugged and spread his hands wide, as though to say that"
2079,"age had its compensations, and Harry noticed a ring on his unin-"
2080,jured hand that he had never seen Dumbledore wear before: It was
2081,"large, rather clumsily made of what looked like gold, and was set"
2082,  67  
2083,CHAPTER FOUR
2084,with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle.
2085,"Slughorn’s eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry"
2086,saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead.
2087,"“So, all these precautions against intruders, Horace . . . are they"
2088,"for the Death Eaters’ benefit, or mine?” asked Dumbledore."
2089,“What would the Death Eaters want with a poor broken-down
2090,old buffer like me?” demanded Slughorn.
2091,“I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable
2092,"talents to coercion, torture, and murder,” said Dumbledore. “Are"
2093,you really telling me that they haven’t come recruiting yet?”
2094,"Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then mut-"
2095,"tered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve been on the move for"
2096,a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Mug-
2097,gle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holi-
2098,"day in the Canary Islands — it’s been very pleasant, I’ll be sorry to"
2099,"leave. It’s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing"
2100,Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneako-
2101,scopes and make sure the neighbors don’t spot you bringing in the
2102,piano.”
2103,"“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “But it sounds a rather tiring ex-"
2104,"istence for a broken-down old buffer in search of a quiet life. Now,"
2105,if you were to return to Hogwarts —”
2106,“If you’re going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that
2107,"pestilential school, you can save your breath, Albus! I might have"
2108,"been in hiding, but some funny rumors have reached me since Do-"
2109,lores Umbridge left! If that’s how you treat teachers these days —”
2110,"“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said Dum-"
2111,"bledore. “I think you, Horace, would have known better than to"
2112, 68   
2113,HORACE SLUGHORN
2114,stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-
2115,breeds.’ ”
2116,"“That’s what she did, did she?” said Slughorn. “Idiotic woman."
2117,Never liked her.”
2118,Harry chuckled and both Dumbledore and Slughorn looked
2119,round at him.
2120,"“Sorry,” Harry said hastily. “It’s just — I didn’t like her either.”"
2121,Dumbledore stood up rather suddenly.
2122,"“Are you leaving?” asked Slughorn at once, looking hopeful."
2123,"“No, I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom,” said"
2124,Dumbledore.
2125,"“Oh,” said Slughorn, clearly disappointed. “Second on the left"
2126,down the hall.”
2127,Dumbledore strode from the room. Once the door had closed
2128,"behind him, there was silence. After a few moments, Slughorn got"
2129,to his feet but seemed uncertain what to do with himself. He shot a
2130,"furtive look at Harry, then crossed to the fire and turned his back"
2131,"on it, warming his wide behind."
2132,"“Don’t think I don’t know why he’s brought you,” he said"
2133,abruptly.
2134,Harry merely looked at Slughorn. Slughorn’s watery eyes slid
2135,"over Harry’s scar, this time taking in the rest of his face."
2136,“You look very like your father.”
2137,"“Yeah, I’ve been told,” said Harry."
2138,“Except for your eyes. You’ve got —”
2139,"“My mother’s eyes, yeah.” Harry had heard it so often he found"
2140,it a bit wearing.
2141,"“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher, of"
2142,  69   
2143,CHAPTER FOUR
2144,"course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,” Slughorn added, in"
2145,answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the bright-
2146,"est I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell"
2147,her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I
2148,used to get back too.”
2149,“Which was your House?”
2150,"“I was Head of Slytherin,” said Slughorn. “Oh, now,” he went"
2151,"on quickly, seeing the expression on Harry’s face and wagging a"
2152,"stubby finger at him, “don’t go holding that against me! You’ll be"
2153,"Gryffindor like her, I suppose? Yes, it usually goes in families. Not"
2154,"always, though. Ever heard of Sirius Black? You must have done —"
2155,been in the papers for the last couple of years — died a few weeks
2156,ago —”
2157,It was as though an invisible hand had twisted Harry’s intestines
2158,and held them tight.
2159,"“Well, anyway, he was a big pal of your father’s at school. The"
2160,"whole Black family had been in my House, but Sirius ended up"
2161,"in Gryffindor! Shame — he was a talented boy. I got his brother,"
2162,"Regulus, when he came along, but I’d have liked the set.”"
2163,He sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid
2164,"at auction. Apparently lost in memories, he gazed at the opposite"
2165,"wall, turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside."
2166,"“Your mother was Muggle-born, of course. Couldn’t believe it"
2167,"when I found out. Thought she must have been pure-blood, she"
2168,was so good.”
2169,"“One of my best friends is Muggle-born,” said Harry, “and she’s"
2170,the best in our year.”
2171,"“Funny how that sometimes happens, isn’t it?” said Slughorn."
2172, 70  
2173,HORACE SLUGHORN
2174,"“Not really,” said Harry coldly."
2175,Slughorn looked down at him in surprise. “You mustn’t think
2176,"I’m prejudiced!” he said. “No, no, no! Haven’t I just said your"
2177,mother was one of my all-time favorite students? And there was
2178,Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too — now Head of the Gob-
2179,"lin Liaison Office, of course — another Muggle-born, a very gifted"
2180,"student, and still gives me excellent inside information on the"
2181,goings-on at Gringotts!”
2182,"He bounced up and down a little, smiling in a self-satisfied way,"
2183,and pointed at the many glittering photograph frames on the
2184,"dresser, each peopled with tiny moving occupants."
2185,"“All ex-students, all signed. You’ll notice Barnabas Cuffe, editor"
2186,"of the Daily Prophet, he’s always interested to hear my take on the"
2187,"day’s news. And Ambrosius Flume, of Honeydukes — a hamper"
2188,"every birthday, and all because I was able to give him an introduc-"
2189,"tion to Ciceron Harkiss, who gave him his first job! And at the"
2190,back — you’ll see her if you just crane your neck — that’s Gwenog
2191,"Jones, who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies. . . . People"
2192,are always astonished to hear I’m on first-name terms with the
2193,"Harpies, and free tickets whenever I want them!”"
2194,This thought seemed to cheer him up enormously.
2195,"“And all these people know where to find you, to send you"
2196,"stuff?” asked Harry, who could not help wondering why the Death"
2197,"Eaters had not yet tracked down Slughorn if hampers of sweets,"
2198,"Quidditch tickets, and visitors craving his advice and opinions"
2199,could find him.
2200,The smile slid from Slughorn’s face as quickly as the blood from
2201,his walls.
2202, 71  
2203,CHAPTER FOUR
2204,"“Of course not,” he said, looking down at Harry. “I have been"
2205,out of touch with everybody for a year.”
2206,Harry had the impression that the words shocked Slughorn him-
2207,self; he looked quite unsettled for a moment. Then he shrugged.
2208,“Still . . . the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times.
2209,"All very well for Dumbledore to talk, but taking up a post at Hog-"
2210,warts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public alle-
2211,giance to the Order of the Phoenix! And while I’m sure they’re very
2212,"admirable and brave and all the rest of it, I don’t personally fancy"
2213,the mortality rate —”
2214,"“You don’t have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts,” said"
2215,"Harry, who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice:"
2216,It was hard to sympathize with Slughorn’s cosseted existence when
2217,"he remembered Sirius, crouching in a cave and living on rats."
2218,"“Most of the teachers aren’t in it, and none of them has ever been"
2219,"killed — well, unless you count Quirrell, and he got what he de-"
2220,served seeing as he was working with Voldemort.”
2221,Harry had been sure Slughorn would be one of those wizards
2222,"who could not bear to hear Voldemort’s name spoken aloud, and"
2223,was not disappointed: Slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of
2224,"protest, which Harry ignored."
2225,“I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumble-
2226,dore’s headmaster; he’s supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever
2227,"feared, isn’t he?” Harry went on."
2228,Slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two: He seemed to
2229,be thinking over Harry’s words.
2230,"“Well, yes, it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has"
2231,"never sought a fight with Dumbledore,” he muttered grudgingly."
2232, 72 
2233,HORACE SLUGHORN
2234,“And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death
2235,"Eaters, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a"
2236,"friend . . . in which case, I might well be safer a little closer to Albus."
2237,. . . I cannot pretend that Amelia Bones’s death did not shake
2238,"me. . . . If she, with all her Ministry contacts and protection . . .”"
2239,Dumbledore reentered the room and Slughorn jumped as
2240,though he had forgotten he was in the house.
2241,"“Oh, there you are, Albus,” he said. “You’ve been a very long"
2242,time. Upset stomach?”
2243,"“No, I was merely reading the Muggle magazines,” said Dum-"
2244,"bledore. “I do love knitting patterns. Well, Harry, we have tres-"
2245,passed upon Horace’s hospitality quite long enough; I think it is
2246,time for us to leave.”
2247,"Not at all reluctant to obey, Harry jumped to his feet. Slughorn"
2248,seemed taken aback.
2249,“You’re leaving?”
2250,"“Yes, indeed. I think I know a lost cause when I see one.”"
2251,“Lost. . . ?”
2252,Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidg-
2253,"eted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and"
2254,Harry zip up his jacket.
2255,"“Well, I’m sorry you don’t want the job, Horace,” said Dumble-"
2256,"dore, raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute. “Hogwarts"
2257,would have been glad to see you back again. Our greatly increased
2258,"security notwithstanding, you will always be welcome to visit,"
2259,should you wish to.”
2260,“Yes . . . well . . . very gracious . . . as I say . . .”
2261,"“Good-bye, then.”"
2262, 73   
2263,CHAPTER FOUR
2264,"“Bye,” said Harry."
2265,They were at the front door when there was a shout from behind
2266,them.
2267,"“All right, all right, I’ll do it!”"
2268,Dumbledore turned to see Slughorn standing breathless in the
2269,doorway to the sitting room.
2270,“You will come out of retirement?”
2271,"“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, but yes.”"
2272,"“Wonderful,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Then, Horace, we"
2273,shall see you on the first of September.”
2274,"“Yes, I daresay you will,” grunted Slughorn."
2275,"As they set off down the garden path, Slughorn’s voice floated af-"
2276,"ter them, “I’ll want a pay rise, Dumbledore!”"
2277,Dumbledore chuckled. The garden gate swung shut behind
2278,"them, and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the"
2279,swirling mist.
2280,"“Well done, Harry,” said Dumbledore."
2281,"“I didn’t do anything,” said Harry in surprise."
2282,“Oh yes you did. You showed Horace exactly how much he
2283,stands to gain by returning to Hogwarts. Did you like him?”
2284,“Er . . .”
2285,Harry wasn’t sure whether he liked Slughorn or not. He sup-
2286,"posed he had been pleasant in his way, but he had also seemed vain"
2287,"and, whatever he said to the contrary, much too surprised that a"
2288,Muggle-born should make a good witch.
2289,"“Horace,” said Dumbledore, relieving Harry of the responsibil-"
2290,"ity to say any of this, “likes his comfort. He also likes the company"
2291,"of the famous, the successful, and the powerful. He enjoys the feel-"
2292,ing that he influences these people. He has never wanted to occupy
2293, 74 
2294,HORACE SLUGHORN
2295,the throne himself; he prefers the backseat — more room to spread
2296,"out, you see. He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts, some-"
2297,"times for their ambition or their brains, sometimes for their charm"
2298,"or their talent, and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those"
2299,who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields.
2300,Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the
2301,"center, making introductions, forging useful contacts between"
2302,"members, and always reaping some kind of benefit in return,"
2303,whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the
2304,chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin
2305,Liaison Office.”
2306,Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen
2307,"spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there"
2308,to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer.
2309,"“I tell you all this,” Dumbledore continued, “not to turn you"
2310,"against Horace — or, as we must now call him, Professor Slug-"
2311,horn — but to put you on your guard. He will undoubtedly try to
2312,"collect you, Harry. You would be the jewel of his collection; ‘the"
2313,"Boy Who Lived’ . . . or, as they call you these days, ‘the Chosen"
2314,One.’ ”
2315,"At these words, a chill that had nothing to do with the sur-"
2316,rounding mist stole over Harry. He was reminded of words he had
2317,"heard a few weeks ago, words that had a horrible and particular"
2318,meaning to him: Neither can live while the other survives . . .
2319,"Dumbledore had stopped walking, level with the church they"
2320,had passed earlier.
2321,"“This will do, Harry. If you will grasp my arm.”"
2322,"Braced this time, Harry was ready for the Apparition, but still"
2323,found it unpleasant. When the pressure disappeared and he found
2324, 75    
2325,CHAPTER FOUR
2326,"himself able to breathe again, he was standing in a country lane"
2327,beside Dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of
2328,his second favorite building in the world: the Burrow. In spite of
2329,"the feeling of dread that had just swept through him, his spirits"
2330,could not help but lift at the sight of it. Ron was in there . . . and
2331,"so was Mrs. Weasley, who could cook better than anyone he"
2332,knew. . . .
2333,"“If you don’t mind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, as they passed"
2334,"through the gate, “I’d like a few words with you before we part. In"
2335,private. Perhaps in here?”
2336,Dumbledore pointed toward a run-down stone outhouse where
2337,"the Weasleys kept their broomsticks. A little puzzled, Harry fol-"
2338,lowed Dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little
2339,smaller than the average cupboard. Dumbledore illuminated the
2340,"tip of his wand, so that it glowed like a torch, and smiled down at"
2341,Harry.
2342,"“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am"
2343,pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after
2344,everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I
2345,think Sirius would have been proud of you.”
2346,Harry swallowed; his voice seemed to have deserted him. He did
2347,not think he could stand to discuss Sirius; it had been painful
2348,enough to hear Uncle Vernon say “His godfather’s dead?” and even
2349,worse to hear Sirius’s name thrown out casually by Slughorn.
2350,"“It was cruel,” said Dumbledore softly, “that you and Sirius had"
2351,such a short time together. A brutal ending to what should have
2352,been a long and happy relationship.”
2353,"Harry nodded, his eyes fixed resolutely on the spider now climb-"
2354,"ing Dumbledore’s hat. He could tell that Dumbledore understood,"
2355, 76 
2356,HORACE SLUGHORN
2357,"that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived, Harry had"
2358,"spent nearly all his time at the Dursleys’ lying on his bed, refusing"
2359,"meals, and staring at the misted window, full of the chill emptiness"
2360,that he had come to associate with dementors.
2361,"“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to realize he"
2362,won’t write to me again.”
2363,His eyes burned suddenly and he blinked. He felt stupid for ad-
2364,"mitting it, but the fact that he had had someone outside Hogwarts"
2365,"who cared what happened to him, almost like a parent, had been"
2366,one of the best things about discovering his godfather . . . and now
2367,the post owls would never bring him that comfort again. . . .
2368,“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known
2369,"before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, the loss is devastat-"
2370,ing. . . .”
2371,"“But while I was at the Dursleys’ . . .” interrupted Harry, his"
2372,"voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t shut myself away or — or"
2373,"crack up. Sirius wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? And anyway,"
2374,"life’s too short. . . . Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline"
2375,"Vance. . . . It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” he said"
2376,"fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleam-"
2377,"ing in the wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters"
2378,"with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.”"
2379,“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true
2380,"godson!” said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry’s back."
2381,"“I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid of"
2382,showering you in spiders.
2383,"“And now, Harry, on a closely related subject . . . I gather that"
2384,you have been taking the Daily Prophet over the last two weeks?”
2385,"“Yes,” said Harry, and his heart beat a little faster."
2386,  77  
2387,CHAPTER FOUR
2388,“Then you will have seen that there have been not so much leaks
2389,as floods concerning your adventure in the Hall of Prophecy?”
2390,"“Yes,” said Harry again. “And now everyone knows that I’m the"
2391,one —”
2392,"“No, they do not,” interrupted Dumbledore. “There are only"
2393,two people in the whole world who know the full contents of the
2394,"prophecy made about you and Lord Voldemort, and they are both"
2395,"standing in this smelly, spidery broom shed. It is true, however,"
2396,"that many have guessed, correctly, that Voldemort sent his Death"
2397,"Eaters to steal a prophecy, and that the prophecy concerned you."
2398,"“Now, I think I am correct in saying that you have not told any-"
2399,body that you know what the prophecy said?”
2400,"“No,” said Harry."
2401,"“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. “Although I"
2402,"think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald"
2403,"Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,” he continued, when"
2404,"Harry looked startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a"
2405,disservice by not confiding something this important to them.”
2406,“I didn’t want —”
2407,"“— to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, surveying"
2408,"Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “Or perhaps, to"
2409,confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need
2410,"your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have"
2411,wanted you to shut yourself away.”
2412,"Harry said nothing, but Dumbledore did not seem to require an"
2413,"answer. He continued, “On a different, though related, subject, it"
2414,is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year.”
2415, 78  
2416,HORACE SLUGHORN
2417,"“Private — with you?” said Harry, surprised out of his preoccu-"
2418,pied silence.
2419,“Yes. I think it is time that I took a greater hand in your educa-
2420,tion.”
2421,"“What will you be teaching me, sir?”"
2422,"“Oh, a little of this, a little of that,” said Dumbledore airily."
2423,"Harry waited hopefully, but Dumbledore did not elaborate, so"
2424,he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly.
2425,"“If I’m having lessons with you, I won’t have to do Occlumency"
2426,"lessons with Snape, will I?”"
2427,"“Professor Snape, Harry — and no, you will not.”"
2428,"“Good,” said Harry in relief, “because they were a —”"
2429,"He stopped, careful not to say what he really thought."
2430,"“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” said Dum-"
2431,"bledore, nodding."
2432,Harry laughed.
2433,"“Well, that means I won’t see much of Professor Snape from now"
2434,"on,” he said, “because he won’t let me carry on Potions unless I get"
2435,"‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L., which I know I haven’t.”"
2436,"“Don’t count your owls before they are delivered,” said Dumble-"
2437,"dore gravely. “Which, now I think of it, ought to be some time later"
2438,"today. Now, two more things, Harry, before we part."
2439,"“Firstly, I wish you to keep your Invisibility Cloak with you at all"
2440,times from this moment onward. Even within Hogwarts itself. Just
2441,"in case, you understand me?”"
2442,Harry nodded.
2443,"“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the"
2444, 79  
2445,CHAPTER FOUR
2446,highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures
2447,have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and
2448,"Molly — all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Min-"
2449,"istry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for"
2450,"their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repay-"
2451,ment if you risked your neck while staying with them.”
2452,"“I understand,” said Harry quickly."
2453,"“Very well, then,” said Dumbledore, pushing open the broom"
2454,shed door and stepping out into the yard. “I see a light in the
2455,kitchen. Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to de-
2456,plore how thin you are.”

2460,H           arry and Dumbledore approached the back door of the
2461,"Burrow, which was surrounded by the familiar litter of"
2462,old Wellington boots and rusty cauldrons; Harry could hear the
2463,soft clucking of sleepy chickens coming from a distant shed. Dum-
2464,bledore knocked three times and Harry saw sudden movement be-
2465,hind the kitchen window.
2466,“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs.
2467,Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!”
2468,"“It is I, Dumbledore, bringing Harry.”"
2469,"The door opened at once. There stood Mrs. Weasley, short,"
2470,"plump, and wearing an old green dressing gown."
2471,"“Harry, dear! Gracious, Albus, you gave me a fright, you said not"
2472,to expect you before morning!”
2473,"“We were lucky,” said Dumbledore, ushering Harry over the"
2474,threshold. “Slughorn proved much more persuadable than I had
2475,"expected. Harry’s doing, of course. Ah, hello, Nymphadora!”"
2476, 81 
2477,CHAPTER FIVE
2478,"Harry looked around and saw that Mrs. Weasley was not alone,"
2479,"despite the lateness of the hour. A young witch with a pale, heart-"
2480,shaped face and mousy brown hair was sitting at the table clutch-
2481,ing a large mug between her hands.
2482,"“Hello, Professor,” she said. “Wotcher, Harry.”"
2483,"“Hi, Tonks.”"
2484,"Harry thought she looked drawn, even ill, and there was some-"
2485,thing forced in her smile. Certainly her appearance was less color-
2486,ful than usual without her customary shade of bubble-gum-pink
2487,hair.
2488,"“I’d better be off,” she said quickly, standing up and pulling her"
2489,"cloak around her shoulders. “Thanks for the tea and sympathy,"
2490,Molly.”
2491,"“Please don’t leave on my account,” said Dumbledore courte-"
2492,"ously, “I cannot stay, I have urgent matters to discuss with Rufus"
2493,Scrimgeour.”
2494,"“No, no, I need to get going,” said Tonks, not meeting Dum-"
2495,bledore’s eyes. “ ’Night —”
2496,"“Dear, why not come to dinner at the weekend, Remus and"
2497,Mad-Eye are coming — ?”
2498,"“No, really, Molly . . . thanks anyway . . . Good night, every-"
2499,one.
2500,Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few
2501,"paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished"
2502,into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.
2503,"“Well, I shall see you at Hogwarts, Harry,” said Dumbledore."
2504,"“Take care of yourself. Molly, your servant.”"
2505,"He made Mrs. Weasley a bow and followed Tonks, vanishing at"
2506,precisely the same spot. Mrs. Weasley closed the door on the empty
2507, 82  
2508,AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
2509,yard and then steered Harry by the shoulders into the full glow of
2510,the lantern on the table to examine his appearance.
2511,"“You’re like Ron,” she sighed, looking him up and down. “Both"
2512,of you look as though you’ve had Stretching Jinxes put on you. I
2513,swear Ron’s grown four inches since I last bought him school robes.
2514,"Are you hungry, Harry?”"
2515,"“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, suddenly realizing just how hungry he"
2516,was.
2517,"“Sit down, dear, I’ll knock something up.”"
2518,"As Harry sat down, a furry ginger cat with a squashed face"
2519,"jumped onto his knees and settled there, purring."
2520,“So Hermione’s here?” he asked happily as he tickled Crook-
2521,shanks behind the ears.
2522,"“Oh yes, she arrived the day before yesterday,” said Mrs. Weas-"
2523,"ley, rapping a large iron pot with her wand. It bounced onto the"
2524,stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once. “Everyone’s in
2525,"bed, of course, we didn’t expect you for hours. Here you are —”"
2526,"She tapped the pot again; it rose into the air, flew toward Harry,"
2527,and tipped over; Mrs. Weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in
2528,"time to catch the stream of thick, steaming onion soup."
2529,"“Bread, dear?”"
2530,"“Thanks, Mrs. Weasley.”"
2531,She waved her wand over her shoulder; a loaf of bread and a
2532,knife soared gracefully onto the table; as the loaf sliced itself and
2533,"the soup pot dropped back onto the stove, Mrs. Weasley sat down"
2534,opposite him.
2535,“So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job?”
2536,"Harry nodded, his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not"
2537,speak.
2538, 83  
2539,CHAPTER FIVE
2540,"“He taught Arthur and me,” said Mrs. Weasley. “He was at Hog-"
2541,"warts for ages, started around the same time as Dumbledore, I"
2542,think. Did you like him?”
2543,"His mouth now full of bread, Harry shrugged and gave a non-"
2544,committal jerk of the head.
2545,"“I know what you mean,” said Mrs. Weasley, nodding wisely."
2546,"“Of course he can be charming when he wants to be, but Arthur’s"
2547,never liked him much. The Ministry’s littered with Slughorn’s old
2548,"favorites, he was always good at giving leg ups, but he never had"
2549,much time for Arthur — didn’t seem to think he was enough of a
2550,"highflier. Well, that just shows you, even Slughorn makes mistakes."
2551,I don’t know whether Ron’s told you in any of his letters — it’s only
2552,just happened — but Arthur’s been promoted!”
2553,It could not have been clearer that Mrs. Weasley had been burst-
2554,ing to say this.
2555,Harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he
2556,could feel his throat blistering. “That’s great!” he gasped.
2557,"“You are sweet,” beamed Mrs. Weasley, possibly taking his wa-"
2558,"tering eyes for emotion at the news. “Yes, Rufus Scrimgeour has set"
2559,"up several new offices in response to the present situation, and"
2560,Arthur’s heading the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of
2561,"Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. It’s a big job,"
2562,he’s got ten people reporting to him now!”
2563,“What exactly — ?”
2564,"“Well, you see, in all the panic about You-Know-Who, odd"
2565,"things have been cropping up for sale everywhere, things that are"
2566,supposed to guard against You-Know-Who and the Death Eaters.
2567,You can imagine the kind of thing — so-called protective potions
2568,"that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added, or instruc-"
2569,  84 
2570,AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
2571,tions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off. . . .
2572,"Well, in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus"
2573,"Fletcher, who’ve never done an honest day’s work in their lives and"
2574,"are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is, but every"
2575,now and then something really nasty turns up. The other day
2576,Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost
2577,"certainly planted by a Death Eater. So you see, it’s a very important"
2578,"job, and I tell him it’s just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and"
2579,toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish.” Mrs. Weasley
2580,"ended her speech with a stern look, as if it had been Harry suggest-"
2581,ing that it was natural to miss spark plugs.
2582,“Is Mr. Weasley still at work?” Harry asked.
2583,"“Yes, he is. As a matter of fact, he’s a tiny bit late. . . . He said"
2584,he’d be back around midnight. . . .”
2585,She turned to look at a large clock that was perched awkwardly
2586,on top of a pile of sheets in the washing basket at the end of the
2587,"table. Harry recognized it at once: It had nine hands, each in-"
2588,"scribed with the name of a family member, and usually hung on"
2589,"the Weasleys’ sitting room wall, though its current position sug-"
2590,gested that Mrs. Weasley had taken to carrying it around the house
2591,with her. Every single one of its nine hands was now pointing at
2592,“mortal peril.”
2593,"“It’s been like that for a while now,” said Mrs. Weasley, in an un-"
2594,"convincingly casual voice, “ever since You-Know-Who came back"
2595,into the open. I suppose everybody’s in mortal danger now. . . . I
2596,don’t think it can be just our family . . . but I don’t know anyone
2597,"else who’s got a clock like this, so I can’t check. Oh!”"
2598,With a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock’s face. Mr.
2599,Weasley’s hand had switched to “traveling.”
2600, 85 
2601,CHAPTER FIVE
2602,“He’s coming!”
2603,"And sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back"
2604,door. Mrs. Weasley jumped up and hurried to it; with one hand on
2605,the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called
2606,"softly, “Arthur, is that you?”"
2607,"“Yes,” came Mr. Weasley’s weary voice. “But I would say that"
2608,"even if I were a Death Eater, dear. Ask the question!”"
2609,"“Oh, honestly . . .”"
2610,“Molly!”
2611,"“All right, all right . . . What is your dearest ambition?”"
2612,“To find out how airplanes stay up.”
2613,"Mrs. Weasley nodded and turned the doorknob, but apparently"
2614,"Mr. Weasley was holding tight to it on the other side, because the"
2615,door remained firmly shut.
2616,“Molly! I’ve got to ask you your question first!”
2617,"“Arthur, really, this is just silly. . . .”"
2618,“What do you like me to call you when we’re alone together?”
2619,Even by the dim light of the lantern Harry could tell that Mrs.
2620,Weasley had turned bright red; he himself felt suddenly warm
2621,"around the ears and neck, and hastily gulped soup, clattering his"
2622,spoon as loudly as he could against the bowl.
2623,"“Mollywobbles,” whispered a mortified Mrs. Weasley into the"
2624,crack at the edge of the door.
2625,"“Correct,” said Mr. Weasley. “Now you can let me in.”"
2626,"Mrs. Weasley opened the door to reveal her husband, a thin,"
2627,"balding, red-haired wizard wearing horn-rimmed spectacles and a"
2628,long and dusty traveling cloak.
2629,“I still don’t see why we have to go through that every time you
2630,"come home,” said Mrs. Weasley, still pink in the face as she helped"
2631,  86   
2632,AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
2633,"her husband out of his cloak. “I mean, a Death Eater might have"
2634,forced the answer out of you before impersonating you!”
2635,"“I know, dear, but it’s Ministry procedure, and I have to set an"
2636,example. Something smells good — onion soup?”
2637,Mr. Weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table.
2638,“Harry! We didn’t expect you until morning!”
2639,"They shook hands, and Mr. Weasley dropped into the chair be-"
2640,side Harry as Mrs. Weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too.
2641,"“Thanks, Molly. It’s been a tough night. Some idiot’s started sell-"
2642,ing Metamorph-Medals. Just sling them around your neck and
2643,you’ll be able to change your appearance at will. A hundred thou-
2644,"sand disguises, all for ten Galleons!”"
2645,“And what really happens when you put them on?”
2646,"“Mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color, but a cou-"
2647,ple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike warts all over their
2648,bodies. As if St. Mungo’s didn’t have enough to do already!”
2649,“It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find
2650,"funny,” said Mrs. Weasley hesitantly. “Are you sure — ?”"
2651,“Of course I am!” said Mr. Weasley. “The boys wouldn’t do any-
2652,"thing like that now, not when people are desperate for protection!”"
2653,"“So is that why you’re late, Metamorph-Medals?”"
2654,"“No, we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant"
2655,"and Castle, but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had"
2656,sorted it out by the time we got there. . . .”
2657,Harry stifled a yawn behind his hand.
2658,"“Bed,” said an undeceived Mrs. Weasley at once. “I’ve got Fred"
2659,"and George’s room all ready for you, you’ll have it to yourself.”"
2660,"“Why, where are they?”"
2661,"“Oh, they’re in Diagon Alley, sleeping in the little flat over their"
2662, 87  
2663,CHAPTER FIVE
2664,"joke shop as they’re so busy,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I must say, I"
2665,"didn’t approve at first, but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for"
2666,"business! Come on, dear, your trunk’s already up there.”"
2667,"“ ’Night, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry, pushing back his chair."
2668,Crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room.
2669,"“G’night, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley."
2670,Harry saw Mrs. Weasley glance at the clock in the washing
2671,basket as they left the kitchen. All the hands were once again at
2672,“mortal peril.”
2673,Fred and George’s bedroom was on the second floor. Mrs. Weas-
2674,ley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited
2675,"at once, bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow. Though a"
2676,large vase of flowers had been placed on a desk in front of the small
2677,"window, their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of"
2678,what Harry thought was gunpowder. A considerable amount of
2679,"floor space was devoted to a vast number of unmarked, sealed card-"
2680,"board boxes, amongst which stood Harry’s school trunk. The room"
2681,looked as though it was being used as a temporary warehouse.
2682,Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a
2683,"large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew"
2684,she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. Harry bade
2685,"Mrs. Weasley good night, put on pajamas, and got into one of the"
2686,beds. There was something hard inside the pillowcase. He groped
2687,"inside it and pulled out a sticky purple-and-orange sweet, which he"
2688,"recognized as a Puking Pastille. Smiling to himself, he rolled over"
2689,and was instantly asleep.
2690,"Seconds later, or so it seemed to Harry, he was awakened by"
2691,what sounded like cannon fire as the door burst open. Sitting bolt
2692,"upright, he heard the rasp of the curtains being pulled back: The"
2693, 88 
2694,AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
2695,dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eyes. Shielding
2696,"them with one hand, he groped hopelessly for his glasses with the"
2697,other.
2698,“Wuzzgoinon?”
2699,“We didn’t know you were here already!” said a loud and excited
2700,"voice, and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head."
2701,"“Ron, don’t hit him!” said a girl’s voice reproachfully."
2702,"Harry’s hand found his glasses and he shoved them on, though"
2703,"the light was so bright he could hardly see anyway. A long, loom-"
2704,ing shadow quivered in front of him for a moment; he blinked and
2705,"Ron Weasley came into focus, grinning down at him."
2706,“All right?”
2707,"“Never been better,” said Harry, rubbing the top of his head and"
2708,slumping back onto his pillows. “You?”
2709,"“Not bad,” said Ron, pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on"
2710,it. “When did you get here? Mum’s only just told us!”
2711,“About one o’clock this morning.”
2712,“Were the Muggles all right? Did they treat you okay?”
2713,"“Same as usual,” said Harry, as Hermione perched herself on the"
2714,"edge of his bed, “they didn’t talk to me much, but I like it better"
2715,"that way. How’re you, Hermione?”"
2716,"“Oh, I’m fine,” said Hermione, who was scrutinizing Harry as"
2717,though he was sickening for something. He thought he knew what
2718,"was behind this, and as he had no wish to discuss Sirius’s death or"
2719,"any other miserable subject at the moment, he said, “What’s the"
2720,time? Have I missed breakfast?”
2721,"“Don’t worry about that, Mum’s bringing you up a tray; she"
2722,"reckons you look underfed,” said Ron, rolling his eyes. “So, what’s"
2723,been going on?”
2724, 89   
2725,CHAPTER FIVE
2726,"“Nothing much, I’ve just been stuck at my aunt and uncle’s,"
2727,haven’t I?”
2728,“Come off it!” said Ron. “You’ve been off with Dumbledore!”
2729,“It wasn’t that exciting. He just wanted me to help him persuade
2730,this old teacher to come out of retirement. His name’s Horace
2731,Slughorn.”
2732,"“Oh,” said Ron, looking disappointed. “We thought —”"
2733,"Hermione flashed a warning look at Ron, and Ron changed tack"
2734,at top speed.
2735,“— we thought it’d be something like that.”
2736,"“You did?” said Harry, amused."
2737,"“Yeah . . . yeah, now Umbridge has left, obviously we need a new"
2738,"Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, don’t we? So, er, what’s he"
2739,like?”
2740,"“He looks a bit like a walrus, and he used to be Head of"
2741,"Slytherin,” said Harry. “Something wrong, Hermione?”"
2742,She was watching him as though expecting strange symptoms to
2743,manifest themselves at any moment. She rearranged her features
2744,hastily in an unconvincing smile.
2745,"“No, of course not! So, um, did Slughorn seem like he’ll be a"
2746,good teacher?”
2747,"“Dunno,” said Harry. “He can’t be worse than Umbridge, can"
2748,he?”
2749,"“I know someone who’s worse than Umbridge,” said a voice"
2750,"from the doorway. Ron’s younger sister slouched into the room,"
2751,"looking irritable. “Hi, Harry.”"
2752,“What’s up with you?” Ron asked.
2753,"“It’s her,” said Ginny, plonking herself down on Harry’s bed."
2754,“She’s driving me mad.”
2755,  90  
2756,AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
2757,“What’s she done now?” asked Hermione sympathetically.
2758,“It’s the way she talks to me — you’d think I was about three!”
2759,"“I know,” said Hermione, dropping her voice. “She’s so full of"
2760,herself.”
2761,Harry was astonished to hear Hermione talking about Mrs.
2762,"Weasley like this and could not blame Ron for saying angrily,"
2763,“Can’t you two lay off her for five seconds?”
2764,"“Oh, that’s right, defend her,” snapped Ginny. “We all know you"
2765,can’t get enough of her.”
2766,This seemed an odd comment to make about Ron’s mother.
2767,"Starting to feel that he was missing something, Harry said, “Who"
2768,are you — ?”
2769,But his question was answered before he could finish it. The
2770,"bedroom door flew open again, and Harry instinctively yanked the"
2771,bedcovers up to his chin so hard that Hermione and Ginny slid off
2772,the bed onto the floor.
2773,"A young woman was standing in the doorway, a woman of such"
2774,breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely
2775,airless. She was tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared
2776,"to emanate a faint, silvery glow. To complete this vision of perfec-"
2777,"tion, she was carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray."
2778,"“ ’Arry,” she said in a throaty voice. “Eet ’as been too long!”"
2779,"As she swept over the threshold toward him, Mrs. Weasley was"
2780,"revealed, bobbing along in her wake, looking rather cross."
2781,"“There was no need to bring up the tray, I was just about to do"
2782,it myself!”
2783,"“Eet was no trouble,” said Fleur Delacour, setting the tray across"
2784,Harry’s knees and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek: He felt
2785,the places where her mouth had touched him burn. “I ’ave been
2786, 91  
2787,CHAPTER FIVE
2788,"longing to see ’im. You remember my seester, Gabrielle? She never"
2789,stops talking about ’Arry Potter. She will be delighted to see you
2790,again.”
2791,“Oh . . . is she here too?” Harry croaked.
2792,"“No, no, silly boy,” said Fleur with a tinkling laugh, “I mean"
2793,"next summer, when we — but do you not know?”"
2794,Her great blue eyes widened and she looked reproachfully at
2795,"Mrs. Weasley, who said, “We hadn’t got around to telling him yet.”"
2796,"Fleur turned back to Harry, swinging her silvery sheet of hair so"
2797,that it whipped Mrs. Weasley across the face.
2798,“Bill and I are going to be married!”
2799,"“Oh,” said Harry blankly. He could not help noticing how Mrs."
2800,"Weasley, Hermione, and Ginny were all determinedly avoiding one"
2801,another’s gaze. “Wow. Er — congratulations!”
2802,She swooped down upon him and kissed him again.
2803,"“Bill is very busy at ze moment, working very ’ard, and I only"
2804,"work part-time at Gringotts for my Eenglish, so he brought me ’ere"
2805,for a few days to get to know ’is family properly. I was so pleased to
2806,"’ear you would be coming — zere isn’t much to do ’ere, unless you"
2807,"like cooking and chickens! Well — enjoy your breakfast, ’Arry!”"
2808,With these words she turned gracefully and seemed to float out
2809,"of the room, closing the door quietly behind her."
2810,Mrs. Weasley made a noise that sounded like “tchah!”
2811,"“Mum hates her,” said Ginny quietly."
2812,“I do not hate her!” said Mrs. Weasley in a cross whisper. “I just
2813,"think they’ve hurried into this engagement, that’s all!”"
2814,"“They’ve known each other a year,” said Ron, who looked oddly"
2815,groggy and was staring at the closed door.
2816,"“Well, that’s not very long! I know why it’s happened, of course."
2817, 92 
2818,AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM
2819,"It’s all this uncertainty with You-Know-Who coming back, people"
2820,"think they might be dead tomorrow, so they’re rushing all sorts of"
2821,decisions they’d normally take time over. It was the same last time
2822,"he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center —”"
2823,"“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly."
2824,"“Yes, well, your father and I were made for each other, what was"
2825,the point in waiting?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Whereas Bill and Fleur
2826,. . . well . . . what have they really got in common? He’s a hard-
2827,"working, down-to-earth sort of person, whereas she’s —”"
2828,"“A cow,” said Ginny, nodding. “But Bill’s not that down-to-"
2829,"earth. He’s a Curse-Breaker, isn’t he, he likes a bit of adventure, a"

2831,"“Stop calling her that, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley sharply, as"
2832,"Harry and Hermione laughed. “Well, I’d better get on. . . . Eat"
2833,"your eggs while they’re warm, Harry.”"
2834,"Looking careworn, she left the room. Ron still seemed slightly"
2835,punch-drunk; he was shaking his head experimentally like a dog
2836,trying to rid its ears of water.
2837,“Don’t you get used to her if she’s staying in the same house?”
2838,Harry asked.
2839,"“Well, you do,” said Ron, “but if she jumps out at you unex-"

2841,"“It’s pathetic,” said Hermione furiously, striding away from Ron"
2842,as far as she could go and turning to face him with her arms folded
2843,once she had reached the wall.
2844,“You don’t really want her around forever?” Ginny asked Ron
2845,"incredulously. When he merely shrugged, she said, “Well, Mum’s"
2846,"going to put a stop to it if she can, I bet you anything.”"
2847,“How’s she going to manage that?” asked Harry.

2851,"hoping Bill will fall for Tonks instead. I hope he does, I’d much"
2852,rather have her in the family.”
2853,"“Yeah, that’ll work,” said Ron sarcastically. “Listen, no bloke in"
2854,"his right mind’s going to fancy Tonks when Fleur’s around. I mean,"
2855,Tonks is okay-looking when she isn’t doing stupid things to her
2856,"hair and her nose, but —”"
2857,"“She’s a damn sight nicer than Phlegm,’’ said Ginny"
2858,"“And she’s more intelligent, she’s an Auror!” said Hermione from"
2859,the corner.
2860,"“Fleur’s not stupid, she was good enough to enter the Triwizard"
2861,"Tournament,” said Harry."
2862,“Not you as well!” said Hermione bitterly.
2863,"“I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ‘ ’Arry,’ do you?” asked"
2864,Ginny scornfully.
2865,"“No,” said Harry, wishing he hadn’t spoken, “I was just saying,"
2866,"Phlegm — I mean, Fleur —”"
2867,"“I’d much rather have Tonks in the family,” said Ginny. “At least"
2868,she’s a laugh.”
2869,"“She hasn’t been much of a laugh lately,” said Ron. “Every time"
2870,I’ve seen her she’s looked more like Moaning Myrtle.”
2871,"“That’s not fair,” snapped Hermione. “She still hasn’t got over"
2872,"what happened . . . you know . . . I mean, he was her cousin!”"
2873,Harry’s heart sank. They had arrived at Sirius. He picked up a
2874,"fork and began shoveling scrambled eggs into his mouth, hoping to"
2875,deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation.
2876,“Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other!” said Ron. “Sirius was
2877,in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met —”

2880,"“That’s not the point,” said Hermione. “She thinks it was her"
2881,fault he died!”
2882,"“How does she work that one out?” asked Harry, in spite of"
2883,himself.
2884,"“Well, she was fighting Bellatrix Lestrange, wasn’t she? I think"
2885,"she feels that if only she had finished her off, Bellatrix couldn’t have"
2886,killed Sirius.”
2887,"“That’s stupid,” said Ron."
2888,"“It’s survivor’s guilt,” said Hermione. “I know Lupin’s tried to"
2889,"talk her round, but she’s still really down. She’s actually having"
2890,trouble with her Metamorphosing!”
2891,“With her — ?”
2892,"“She can’t change her appearance like she used to,” explained"
2893,"Hermione. “I think her powers must have been affected by shock,"
2894,or something.”
2895,"“I didn’t know that could happen,” said Harry."
2896,"“Nor did I,” said Hermione, “but I suppose if you’re really de-"

2898,The door opened again and Mrs. Weasley popped her head in.
2899,"“Ginny,” she whispered, “come downstairs and help me with the"

2901,"“I’m talking to this lot!” said Ginny, outraged."
2902,"“Now!” said Mrs. Weasley, and withdrew."
2903,“She only wants me there so she doesn’t have to be alone with
2904,Phlegm!” said Ginny crossly. She swung her long red hair around
2905,in a very good imitation of Fleur and pranced across the room with
2906,her arms held aloft like a ballerina.
2907,"“You lot had better come down quickly too,” she said as she left."

2910,Harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more
2911,"breakfast. Hermione was peering into Fred and George’s boxes,"
2912,"though every now and then she cast sideways looks at Harry. Ron,"
2913,"who was now helping himself to Harry’s toast, was still gazing"
2914,dreamily at the door.
2915,"“What’s this?” Hermione asked eventually, holding up what"
2916,looked like a small telescope.
2917,"“Dunno,” said Ron, “but if Fred and George’ve left it here, it’s"
2918,"probably not ready for the joke shop yet, so be careful.”"
2919,"“Your mum said the shop’s going well,” said Harry. “Said Fred"
2920,and George have got a real flair for business.”
2921,"“That’s an understatement,” said Ron. “They’re raking in the"
2922,"Galleons! I can’t wait to see the place, we haven’t been to Diagon"
2923,"Alley yet, because Mum says Dad’s got to be there for extra security"
2924,"and he’s been really busy at work, but it sounds excellent.”"
2925,“And what about Percy?” asked Harry; the third-eldest Weasley
2926,brother had fallen out with the rest of the family. “Is he talking to
2927,your mum and dad again?”
2928,"“Nope,” said Ron."
2929,“But he knows your dad was right all along now about Volde-
2930,mort being back —”
2931,“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for
2932,"being wrong than being right,” said Hermione. “I heard him"
2933,"telling your mum, Ron.”"
2934,"“Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say,”"
2935,said Ron.
2936,"“He’s going to be giving me private lessons this year,” said Harry"

2940,"Ron choked on his bit of toast, and Hermione gasped."
2941,“You kept that quiet!” said Ron.
2942,"“I only just remembered,” said Harry honestly. “He told me last"
2943,night in your broom shed.”
2944,"“Blimey . . . private lessons with Dumbledore!” said Ron, look-"
2945,ing impressed. “I wonder why he’s . . . ?”
2946,His voice tailed away. Harry saw him and Hermione exchange
2947,"looks. Harry laid down his knife and fork, his heart beating rather"
2948,fast considering that all he was doing was sitting in bed. Dumble-
2949,dore had said to do it. . . . Why not now? He fixed his eyes on his
2950,"fork, which was gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap,"
2951,"and said, “I don’t know exactly why he’s going to be giving me"
2952,"lessons, but I think it must be because of the prophecy.”"
2953,Neither Ron nor Hermione spoke. Harry had the impression
2954,"that both had frozen. He continued, still speaking to his fork, “You"
2955,"know, the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry.”"
2956,"“Nobody knows what it said, though,” said Hermione quickly."
2957,“It got smashed.”
2958,"“Although the Prophet says —” began Ron, but Hermione said,"
2959,“Shh!”
2960,"“The Prophet’s got it right,” said Harry, looking up at them both"
2961,with a great effort: Hermione seemed frightened and Ron amazed.
2962,“That glass ball that smashed wasn’t the only record of the
2963,"prophecy. I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore’s office, he was"
2964,"the one the prophecy was made to, so he could tell me. From what"
2965,"it said,” Harry took a deep breath, “it looks like I’m the one who’s"
2966,"got to finish off Voldemort. . . . At least, it said neither of us could"
2967,live while the other survives.”

2970,The three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment.
2971,Then there was a loud bang and Hermione vanished behind a puff
2972,of black smoke.
2973,“Hermione!” shouted Harry and Ron; the breakfast tray slid to
2974,the floor with a crash.
2975,"Hermione emerged, coughing, out of the smoke, clutching the"
2976,telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye.
2977,“I squeezed it and it — it punched me!” she gasped.
2978,"And sure enough, they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring pro-"
2979,truding from the end of the telescope.
2980,"“Don’t worry,” said Ron, who was plainly trying not to laugh,"
2981,"“Mum’ll fix that, she’s good at healing minor injuries —”"
2982,"“Oh well, never mind that now!” said Hermione hastily. “Harry,"
2983,"oh, Harry . . .”"
2984,She sat down on the edge of his bed again.
2985,"“We wondered, after we got back from the Ministry . . . Obvi-"
2986,"ously, we didn’t want to say anything to you, but from what Lucius"
2987,"Malfoy said about the prophecy, how it was about you and Volde-"
2988,"mort, well, we thought it might be something like this. . . . Oh,"
2989,"Harry . . .” She stared at him, then whispered, “Are you scared?”"
2990,"“Not as much as I was,” said Harry. “When I first heard it, I was"
2991,". . . but now, it seems as though I always knew I’d have to face him"
2992,in the end. . . .”
2993,"“When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person, we"
2994,thought he might be telling you something or showing you some-
2995,"thing to do with the prophecy,” said Ron eagerly. “And we were"
2996,"kind of right, weren’t we? He wouldn’t be giving you lessons if he"

3001,"“That’s true,” said Hermione. “I wonder what he’ll teach you,"
3002,"Harry? Really advanced defensive magic, probably . . . powerful"
3003,countercurses . . . anti-jinxes . . .”
3004,Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through
3005,him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction
3006,in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and
3007,"Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the"
3008,"mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking"
3009,"bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he"
3010,"were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could"
3011,ever tell them.
3012,"“. . . and evasive enchantments generally,” concluded Hermi-"

3014,that’s one more than Ron and me. I wonder when our O.W.L. re-
3015,sults will come?”
3016,"“Can’t be long now, it’s been a month,” said Ron."
3017,"“Hang on,” said Harry, as another part of last night’s conver-"
3018,sation came back to him. “I think Dumbledore said our O.W.L.
3019,results would be arriving today!”
3020,“Today?” shrieked Hermione. “Today? But why didn’t you — oh
3021,my God — you should have said —”
3022,She leapt to her feet.
3023,“I’m going to see whether any owls have come. . . .”
3024,"But when Harry arrived downstairs ten minutes later, fully"
3025,"dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray, it was to find"
3026,"Hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation, while Mrs."
3027,Weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda.

3035,"can’t come off,” said Ginny"
3036,“But it’s got to come off!” squeaked Hermione. “I can’t go
3037,around looking like this forever!”
3038,"“You won’t, dear, we’ll find an antidote, don’t worry,” said Mrs."
3039,Weasley soothingly.
3040,"“Bill told me ’ow Fred and George are very amusing!” said Fleur,"
3041,smiling serenely.
3042,"“Yes, I can hardly breathe for laughing,” snapped Hermione."
3043,She jumped up and started walking round and round the
3044,"kitchen, twisting her fingers together."
3045,"“Mrs. Weasley, you’re quite, quite sure no owls have arrived this"
3046,morning?”
3047,"“Yes, dear, I’d have noticed,” said Mrs. Weasley patiently. “But"
3048,"it’s barely nine, there’s still plenty of time. . . .”"
3049,"“I know I messed up Ancient Runes,” muttered Hermione"
3050,"feverishly, “I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation."
3051,And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all.

3057,"“Don’t, don’t, don’t!” said Hermione, flapping her hands hyster-"

3067,"“At Beauxbatons,” said Fleur complacently, “we ’ad a different"
3068,way of doing things. I think eet was better. We sat our examina-

3070,Fleur’s words were drowned in a scream. Hermione was pointing
3071,through the kitchen window. Three black specks were clearly visi-

3073,"“They’re definitely owls,” said Ron hoarsely, jumping up to join"
3074,Hermione at the window.
3075,"“And there are three of them,” said Harry, hastening to her other"
3076,side.
3077,"“One for each of us,” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Oh"
3078,no . . . oh no . . . oh no . . .”
3079,She gripped both Harry and Ron tightly around the elbows.
3080,"The owls were flying directly at the Burrow, three handsome"
3081,"tawnies, each of which, it became clear as they flew lower over the"
3082,"path leading up to the house, was carrying a large square envelope."
3083,“Oh no!” squealed Hermione.
3084,Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen win-
3085,"dow. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the"
3086,table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs.
3087,Harry moved forward. The letter addressed to him was tied to
3088,the leg of the owl in the middle. He untied it with fumbling fin-

3139,‘Exceeds Expectations’ at Defense Against the Dark Arts.” He

3214,“That gives you equal status with prefects!” cried Hermione
3215,happily. “You can use our special bathroom now and everything!”
3216,"“Wow, I remember when Charlie wore one of these,” said Ron,"
3217,"examining the badge with glee. “Harry, this is so cool, you’re my"
3218,"Captain — if you let me back on the team, I suppose, ha ha. . . .”"
3219,"“Well, I don’t suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley"
3220,"much longer now you’ve got these,” sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking"
3221,down Ron’s booklist. “We’ll go on Saturday as long as your father
3222,doesn’t have to go into work again. I’m not going there without
3223,him.”
3224,"“Mum, d’you honestly think You-Know-Who’s going to be hid-"
3225,ing behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts?” sniggered Ron.
3226,"“Fortescue and Ollivander went on holiday, did they?” said Mrs."
3227,"Weasley, firing up at once. “If you think security’s a laughing mat-"
3228,ter you can stay behind and I’ll get your things myself —”
3229,"“No, I wanna come, I want to see Fred and George’s shop!” said"
3230,Ron hastily.
3231,"“Then you just buck up your ideas, young man, before I decide"
3232,"you’re too immature to come with us!” said Mrs. Weasley angrily,"
3233,"snatching up her clock, all nine hands of which were still pointing"
3234,"at “mortal peril,” and balancing it on top of a pile of just-laundered"
3235,towels. “And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!”
3236,Ron turned to stare incredulously at Harry as his mother hoisted
3237,the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arms and
3238,stormed out of the room.
3239,“Blimey . . . you can’t even make a joke round here anymore. . . .”
3240,But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the
3241,next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from
3242,"Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who"
3243, 107   
3244,CHAPTER SIX
3245,would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and
3246,"Ginny’s pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry."
3247,"“Where’s mine?” demanded Ron at once, his eyes wide."
3248,"“That’s already Harry’s, idiot,” said Bill. “I got it out of your"
3249,"vault for you, Harry, because it’s taking about five hours for the"
3250,"public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tight-"
3251,ened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity
3252,"Probe stuck up his . . . Well, trust me, this way’s easier.”"
3253,"“Thanks, Bill,” said Harry, pocketing his gold."
3254,"“ ’E is always so thoughtful,” purred Fleur adoringly, stroking"
3255,Bill’s nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur.
3256,"Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the"
3257,back.
3258,"It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of"
3259,"Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting"
3260,"them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling"
3261,on their cloaks.
3262,"“It’s good Dad can get us these again,” said Ron appreciatively,"
3263,stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the
3264,"Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He,"
3265,"Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in"
3266,the wide backseat.
3267,"“Don’t get used to it, it’s only because of Harry,” said Mr. Weas-"
3268,ley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the
3269,Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched
3270,into what resembled a two-seater sofa. “He’s been given top-grade
3271,security status. And we’ll be joining up with additional security at
3272,the Leaky Cauldron too.”
3273,Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping

3275,DRACO’S DETOUR
3276,while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his
3277,"Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good"
3278,"enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Min-"
3279,"istry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the"
3280,Ministry knew about his cloak.
3281,"“Here you are, then,” said the driver, a surprisingly short while"
3282,"later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross"
3283,Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. “I’m to wait for
3284,"you, any idea how long you’ll be?”"
3285,"“A couple of hours, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley. “Ah, good, he’s"
3286,here!”
3287,Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window;
3288,"his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but"
3289,"instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the"
3290,"Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at"
3291,the sight of Harry’s face and oblivious to the startled stares of pass-
3292,ing Muggles.
3293,"“Harry!” he boomed, sweeping Harry into a bone-crushing hug"
3294,the moment Harry had stepped out of the car. “Buckbeak —
3295,"Witherwings, I mean — yeh should see him, Harry, he’s so happy"
3296,ter be back in the open air —”
3297,"“Glad he’s pleased,” said Harry, grinning as he massaged his ribs."
3298,“We didn’t know ‘security’ meant you!”
3299,"“I know, jus’ like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter"
3300,"send a bunch o’ Aurors, but Dumbledore said I’d do,” said Hagrid"
3301,"proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his"
3302,"pockets. “Let’s get goin’ then — after yeh, Molly, Arthur —”"
3303,"The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry’s memory,"
3304,"completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless,"
3305, 109   
3306,CHAPTER SIX
3307,remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they en-
3308,"tered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, “Jus’"
3309,"passin’ through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts busi-"
3310,"ness, yeh know.”"
3311,"Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry,"
3312,"Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and"
3313,out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins
3314,stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick
3315,"in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a wind-"
3316,"ing cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused,"
3317,looking around.
3318,"Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window dis-"
3319,"plays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to"
3320,"view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had"
3321,been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried
3322,blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pam-
3323,"phlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore"
3324,moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be
3325,on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the
3326,"nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including"
3327,"those of Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand,"
3328,a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street.
3329,"The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and"
3330,"Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign"
3331,pinned to its front:

3336,A seedy-looking little wizard was rattling armfuls of silver sym-
3337,bols on chains at passersby.
3338,"“One for your little girl, madam?” he called at Mrs. Weasley as"
3339,"they passed, leering at Ginny. “Protect her pretty neck?”"
3340,"“If I were on duty . . .” said Mr. Weasley, glaring angrily at the"
3341,amulet seller.
3342,"“Yes, but don’t go arresting anyone now, dear, we’re in a hurry,”"
3343,"said Mrs. Weasley, nervously consulting a list. “I think we’d better"
3344,"do Madam Malkin’s first, Hermione wants new dress robes, and"
3345,"Ron’s showing much too much ankle in his school robes, and you"
3346,"must need new ones too, Harry, you’ve grown so much — come"
3347,"on, everyone —”"
3348,"“Molly, it doesn’t make sense for all of us to go to Madam Mal-"
3349,"kin’s,” said Mr. Weasley. “Why don’t those three go with Hagrid,"
3350,and we can go to Flourish and Blotts and get everyone’s school-
3351,books?”
3352,"“I don’t know,” said Mrs. Weasley anxiously, clearly torn be-"
3353,tween a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick
3354,"together in a pack. “Hagrid, do you think — ?”"
3355,"“Don’ fret, they’ll be fine with me, Molly,” said Hagrid sooth-"
3356,"ingly, waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid. Mrs. Weasley"
3357,"did not look entirely convinced, but allowed the separation, scur-"
3358,rying off toward Flourish and Blotts with her husband and Ginny
3359,"while Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid set off for Madam"
3360,Malkin’s.
3361,Harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the
3362,"same harried, anxious look as Mrs. Weasley, and that nobody was"
3363,stopping to talk anymore; the shoppers stayed together in their
3364, 111  
3365,CHAPTER SIX
3366,"own tightly knit groups, moving intently about their business. No-"
3367,body seemed to be shopping alone.
3368,"“Migh’ be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us,” said Hagrid,"
3369,stopping outside Madam Malkin’s and bending down to peer
3370,"through the window. “I’ll stand guard outside, all right?”"
3371,"So Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the little shop together. It"
3372,"appeared, at first glance, to be empty, but no sooner had the door"
3373,swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing
3374,from behind a rack of dress robes in spangled green and blue.
3375,"“. . . not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I am per-"
3376,fectly capable of doing my shopping alone.”
3377,There was a clucking noise and a voice Harry recognized as that
3378,"of Madam Malkin, the owner, said, “Now, dear, your mother’s"
3379,"quite right, none of us is supposed to go wandering around on our"
3380,"own anymore, it’s nothing to do with being a child —”"
3381,"“Watch where you’re sticking that pin, will you!”"
3382,"A teenage boy with a pale, pointed face and white-blond hair ap-"
3383,"peared from behind the rack, wearing a handsome set of dark green"
3384,robes that glittered with pins around the hem and the edges of the
3385,sleeves. He strode to the mirror and examined himself; it was a few
3386,"moments before he noticed Harry, Ron, and Hermione reflected"
3387,over his shoulder. His light gray eyes narrowed.
3388,"“If you’re wondering what the smell is, Mother, a Mudblood just"
3389,"walked in,” said Draco Malfoy."
3390,“I don’t think there’s any need for language like that!” said
3391,"Madam Malkin, scurrying out from behind the clothes rack hold-"
3392,ing a tape measure and a wand. “And I don’t want wands drawn in
3393,"my shop either!” she added hastily, for a glance toward the door"
3394, 112  
3395,DRACO’S DETOUR
3396,had shown her Harry and Ron both standing there with their
3397,"wands out and pointing at Malfoy. Hermione, who was standing"
3398,"slightly behind them, whispered, “No, don’t, honestly, it’s not"
3399,worth it. . . .”
3400,"“Yeah, like you’d dare do magic out of school,” sneered Malfoy."
3401,"“Who blacked your eye, Granger? I want to send them flowers.”"
3402,"“That’s quite enough!” said Madam Malkin sharply, looking"
3403,over her shoulder for support. “Madam — please —”
3404,Narcissa Malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack.
3405,"“Put those away,” she said coldly to Harry and Ron. “If you at-"
3406,"tack my son again, I shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever"
3407,do.”
3408,"“Really?” said Harry, taking a step forward and gazing into the"
3409,"smoothly arrogant face that, for all its pallor, still resembled her sis-"
3410,ter’s. He was as tall as she was now. “Going to get a few Death Eater
3411,"pals to do us in, are you?”"
3412,Madam Malkin squealed and clutched at her heart.
3413,"“Really, you shouldn’t accuse — dangerous thing to say —"
3414,"wands away, please!”"
3415,But Harry did not lower his wand. Narcissa Malfoy smiled
3416,unpleasantly.
3417,“I see that being Dumbledore’s favorite has given you a false
3418,"sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won’t always be"
3419,there to protect you.”
3420,Harry looked mockingly all around the shop. “Wow . . . look
3421,at that . . . he’s not here now! So why not have a go? They might
3422,be able to find you a double cell in Azkaban with your loser of a

3425,CHAPTER SIX
3426,"Malfoy made an angry movement toward Harry, but stumbled"
3427,over his overlong robe. Ron laughed loudly.
3428,"“Don’t you dare talk to my mother like that, Potter!” Malfoy"
3429,snarled.
3430,"“It’s all right, Draco,” said Narcissa, restraining him with her"
3431,thin white fingers upon his shoulder. “I expect Potter will be re-
3432,united with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
3433,Harry raised his wand higher.
3434,"“Harry, no!” moaned Hermione, grabbing his arm and attempt-"
3435,ing to push it down by his side. “Think. . . . You mustn’t. . . . You’ll
3436,be in such trouble. . . .”
3437,"Madam Malkin dithered for a moment on the spot, then seemed"
3438,to decide to act as though nothing was happening in the hope
3439,"that it wouldn’t. She bent toward Malfoy, who was still glaring at"
3440,Harry.
3441,"“I think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more, dear, let"
3442,me just —”
3443,"“Ouch!” bellowed Malfoy, slapping her hand away. “Watch"
3444,"where you’re putting your pins, woman! Mother — I don’t think I"
3445,want these anymore —”
3446,He pulled the robes over his head and threw them onto the floor
3447,at Madam Malkin’s feet.
3448,"“You’re right, Draco,” said Narcissa, with a contemptuous"
3449,"glance at Hermione, “now I know the kind of scum that shops"
3450,here. . . . We’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”
3451,"And with that, the pair of them strode out of the shop, Malfoy"
3452,taking care to bang as hard as he could into Ron on the way out.
3453,"“Well, really!” said Madam Malkin, snatching up the fallen robes"
3454, 114    
3455,DRACO’S DETOUR
3456,"and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner,"
3457,so that it removed all the dust.
3458,She was distracted all through the fitting of Ron’s and Harry’s
3459,"new robes, tried to sell Hermione wizard’s dress robes instead of"
3460,"witch’s, and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it was"
3461,with an air of being glad to see the back of them.
3462,“Got ev’rything?” asked Hagrid brightly when they reappeared
3463,at his side.
3464,"“Just about,” said Harry. “Did you see the Malfoys?”"
3465,"“Yeah,” said Hagrid, unconcerned. “Bu’ they wouldn’ dare make"
3466,"trouble in the middle o’ Diagon Alley, Harry. Don’ worry abou’"
3467,them.”
3468,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchanged looks, but before they"
3469,"could disabuse Hagrid of this comfortable notion, Mr. and Mrs."
3470,"Weasley and Ginny appeared, all clutching heavy packages of"
3471,books.
3472,“Everyone all right?” said Mrs. Weasley. “Got your robes? Right
3473,"then, we can pop in at the Apothecary and Eeylops on the way to"
3474,"Fred and George’s — stick close, now. . . .”"
3475,Neither Harry nor Ron bought any ingredients at the Apothe-
3476,"cary, seeing that they were no longer studying Potions, but both"
3477,bought large boxes of owl nuts for Hedwig and Pigwidgeon at Eey-
3478,"lops Owl Emporium. Then, with Mrs. Weasley checking her watch"
3479,"every minute or so, they headed farther along the street in search of"
3480,"Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, the joke shop run by Fred and George."
3481,"“We really haven’t got too long,” Mrs. Weasley said. “So we’ll"
3482,just have a quick look around and then back to the car. We must be
3483,"close, that’s number ninety-two . . . ninety-four . . .”"
3484,  115  
3485,CHAPTER SIX
3486,"“Whoa,” said Ron, stopping in his tracks."
3487,"Set against the dull, poster-muffled shop fronts around them,"
3488,Fred and George’s windows hit the eye like a firework display.
3489,Casual passersby were looking back over their shoulders at the win-
3490,"dows, and a few rather stunned-looking people had actually come"
3491,"to a halt, transfixed. The left-hand window was dazzlingly full of an"
3492,"assortment of goods that revolved, popped, flashed, bounced, and"
3493,shrieked; Harry’s eyes began to water just looking at it. The right-
3494,"hand window was covered with a gigantic poster, purple like those"
3495,"of the Ministry, but emblazoned with flashing yellow letters:"
3496,WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT

3499,U-NO-POO —
3500,THE CONSTIPATION SENSATION
3501,THAT’S GRIPPING THE NATION!
3502,Harry started to laugh. He heard a weak sort of moan beside him
3503,"and looked around to see Mrs. Weasley gazing, dumbfounded, at the"
3504,"poster. Her lips moved silently, mouthing the name “U-No-Poo.”"
3505,“They’ll be murdered in their beds!” she whispered.
3506,"“No they won’t!” said Ron, who, like Harry, was laughing. “This"
3507,is brilliant!”
3508,And he and Harry led the way into the shop. It was packed with
3509,"customers; Harry could not get near the shelves. He stared around,"
3510,looking up at the boxes piled to the ceiling: Here were the Skiving

3515,"was most popular, with only one battered box left on the shelf."
3516,"There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning"
3517,"into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most ex-"
3518,"pensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and"
3519,"boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and"
3520,"Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry"
3521,"pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted"
3522,ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly as-
3523,"cending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box"
3524,that read: reusable hangman — spell it or he’ll swing!
3525,“ ‘Patented Daydream Charms . . .’ ”
3526,Hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display
3527,near the counter and was reading the information on the back of a
3528,box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a
3529,swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship.
3530,"“ ‘One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality,"

3534,"You know,” said Hermione, looking up at Harry, “that really is ex-"

3536,"“For that, Hermione,” said a voice behind them, “you can have"
3537,one for free.”
3538,"A beaming Fred stood before them, wearing a set of magenta"
3539,robes that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair.
3540,"“How are you, Harry?” They shook hands. “And what’s hap-"

3544,"“Your punching telescope,” she said ruefully."
3545,"“Oh blimey, I forgot about those,” said Fred. “Here —”"
3546,He pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her; she un-
3547,screwed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste.
3548,"“Just dab it on, that bruise’ll be gone within the hour,” said Fred."
3549,“We had to find a decent bruise remover. “We’re testing most of our
3550,products on ourselves.”
3551,"Hermione looked nervous. “It is safe, isn’t it?” she asked."
3552,"“ ’Course it is,” said Fred bracingly. “Come on, Harry, I’ll give"
3553,you a tour.”
3554,Harry left Hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and fol-
3555,"lowed Fred toward the back of the shop, where he saw a stand of"
3556,card and rope tricks.
3557,"“Muggle magic tricks!” said Fred happily, pointing them out."
3558,"“For freaks like Dad, you know, who love Muggle stuff. It’s not a"
3559,"big earner, but we do fairly steady business, they’re great novelties."
3560,". . . Oh, here’s George. . . .”"
3561,Fred’s twin shook Harry’s hand energetically.
3562,"“Giving him the tour? Come through the back, Harry, that’s"
3563,"where we’re making the real money — pocket anything, you, and"
3564,you’ll pay in more than Galleons!” he added warningly to a small boy
3565,who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark
3566,marks — they’ll make anyone sick!
3567,George pushed back a curtain beside the Muggle tricks and
3568,"Harry saw a darker, less crowded room. The packaging on the"
3569,products lining these shelves was more subdued.
3570,"“We’ve just developed this more serious line,” said Fred. “Funny"

3604,"“There’s a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron, Mr."
3605,"Weasley and Mr. Weasley,” she said."
3606,Harry found it very odd to hear Fred and George called “Mr.
3607,"Weasley,” but they took it in their stride."
3608,"“Right you are, Verity, I’m coming,” said George promptly."
3609,"“Harry, you help yourself to anything you want, all right? No"
3610,charge.”
3611,"“I can’t do that!” said Harry, who had already pulled out his"
3612,money bag to pay for the Decoy Detonators.
3613,"“You don’t pay here,” said Fred firmly, waving away Harry’s"
3614,gold.
3615,“But —”
3616,"“You gave us our start-up loan, we haven’t forgotten,” said"
3617,"George sternly. “Take whatever you like, and just remember to tell"
3618,"people where you got it, if they ask.”"
3619,George swept off through the curtain to help with the cus-
3620,"tomers, and Fred led Harry back into the main part of the shop to"
3621,find Hermione and Ginny still poring over the Patented Daydream
3622,Charms.
3623,“Haven’t you girls found our special WonderWitch products
3624,"yet?” asked Fred. “Follow me, ladies. . . .”"
3625,Near the window was an array of violently pink products around
3626,which a cluster of excited girls was giggling enthusiastically. Hermi-
3627,"one and Ginny both hung back, looking wary."
3628,"“There you go,” said Fred proudly. “Best range of love potions"
3629,you’ll find anywhere.”

3636,"suddenly at their side. “But we’re not selling them to our sister,” he"
3637,"added, becoming suddenly stern, “not when she’s already got about"
3638,five boys on the go from what we’ve —”
3639,"“Whatever you’ve heard from Ron is a big fat lie,” said Ginny"
3640,"calmly, leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf."
3641,“What’s this?”
3642,"“Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher,” said Fred. “Excellent"
3643,"on everything from boils to blackheads, but don’t change the sub-"
3644,ject. Are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called
3645,Dean Thomas?”
3646,"“Yes, I am,” said Ginny. “And last time I looked, he was defi-"
3647,"nitely one boy, not five. What are those?”"
3648,She was pointing at a number of round balls of fluff in shades of
3649,"pink and purple, all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emit-"
3650,ting high-pitched squeaks.
3651,"“Pygmy Puffs,” said George. “Miniature puffskeins, we can’t"
3652,breed them fast enough. So what about Michael Corner?”
3653,"“I dumped him, he was a bad loser,” said Ginny, putting a finger"
3654,through the bars of the cage and watching the Pygmy Puffs crowd
3655,around it. “They’re really cute!”
3656,"“They’re fairly cuddly, yes,” conceded Fred. “But you’re moving"
3657,"through boyfriends a bit fast, aren’t you?”"
3658,"Ginny turned to look at him, her hands on her hips. There was"
3659,such a Mrs. Weasley-ish glare on her face that Harry was surprised
3660,Fred didn’t recoil.
3661,"“It’s none of your business. And I’ll thank you,” she added an-"

3666,"“That’s three Galleons, nine Sickles, and a Knut,” said Fred, ex-"
3667,amining the many boxes in Ron’s arms. “Cough up.”
3668,“I’m your brother!”
3669,"“And that’s our stuff you’re nicking. Three Galleons, nine Sick-"

3671,"“But I haven’t got three Galleons, nine Sickles!”"
3672,"“You’d better put it back then, and mind you put it on the right"

3674,"Ron dropped several boxes, swore, and made a rude hand ges-"

3676,had chosen that moment to appear.
3677,"“If I see you do that again I’ll jinx your fingers together,” she said"
3678,sharply.
3679,"“Mum, can I have a Pygmy Puff?” said Ginny at once."
3680,“A what?” said Mrs. Weasley warily.
3681,"“Look, they’re so sweet. . . .”"
3682,"Mrs. Weasley moved aside to look at the Pygmy Puffs, and"
3683,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view"
3684,out of the window. Draco Malfoy was hurrying up the street alone.
3685,"As he passed Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes, he glanced over his shoul-"
3686,"der. Seconds later, he moved beyond the scope of the window and"
3687,they lost sight of him.
3688,"“Wonder where his mummy is?” said Harry, frowning."
3689,"“Given her the slip by the looks of it,” said Ron."
3690,"“Why, though?” said Hermione."
3691,Harry said nothing; he was thinking too hard. Narcissa Malfoy
3692,would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly; Mal-
3693,foy must have made a real effort to free himself from her clutches.

3695,DRACO’S DETOUR
3696,"Harry, knowing and loathing Malfoy, was sure the reason could not"
3697,be innocent.
3698,He glanced around. Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were bending over
3699,the Pygmy Puffs. Mr. Weasley was delightedly examining a pack of
3700,Muggle marked playing cards. Fred and George were both helping
3701,"customers. On the other side of the glass, Hagrid was standing"
3702,"with his back to them, looking up and down the street."
3703,"“Get under here, quick,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility"
3704,Cloak out of his bag.
3705,"“Oh — I don’t know, Harry,” said Hermione, looking uncer-"
3706,tainly toward Mrs. Weasley.
3707,“Come on!” said Ron.
3708,"She hesitated for a second longer, then ducked under the cloak"
3709,with Harry and Ron. Nobody noticed them vanish; they were all
3710,"too interested in Fred and George’s products. Harry, Ron, and Her-"
3711,"mione squeezed their way out of the door as quickly as they could,"
3712,"but by the time they gained the street, Malfoy had disappeared just"
3713,as successfully as they had.
3714,"“He was going in that direction,” murmured Harry as quietly as"
3715,"possible, so that the humming Hagrid would not hear them."
3716,“C’mon.”
3717,"They scurried along, peering left and right, through shop win-"
3718,"dows and doors, until Hermione pointed ahead."
3719,"“That’s him, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Turning left?”"
3720,"“Big surprise,” whispered Ron."
3721,"For Malfoy had glanced around, then slid into Knockturn Alley"
3722,and out of sight.
3723,"“Quick, or we’ll lose him,” said Harry, speeding up."
3724, 123  
3725,CHAPTER SIX
3726,"“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak"
3727,flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hid-
3728,ing all three of them under the cloak nowadays.
3729,"“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry impatiently. “Just hurry!”"
3730,"But Knockturn Alley, the side street devoted to the Dark Arts,"
3731,looked completely deserted. They peered into windows as they
3732,"passed, but none of the shops seemed to have any customers at all."
3733,Harry supposed it was a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and
3734,"suspicious times to buy Dark artifacts — or at least, to be seen buy-"
3735,ing them.
3736,Hermione gave his arm a hard pinch.
3737,“Ouch!”
3738,“Shh! Look! He’s in there!” she breathed in Harry’s ear.
3739,They had drawn level with the only shop in Knockturn Alley
3740,"that Harry had ever visited, Borgin and Burkes, which sold a wide"
3741,variety of sinister objects. There in the midst of the cases full of
3742,"skulls and old bottles stood Draco Malfoy with his back to them,"
3743,just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which
3744,Harry had once hidden to avoid Malfoy and his father. Judging by
3745,"the movements of Malfoy’s hands, he was talking animatedly. The"
3746,"proprietor of the shop, Mr. Borgin, an oily-haired, stooping man,"
3747,stood facing Malfoy. He was wearing a curious expression of min-
3748,gled resentment and fear.
3749,“If only we could hear what they’re saying!” said Hermione.
3750,“We can!” said Ron excitedly. “Hang on — damn —”
3751,He dropped a couple more of the boxes he was still clutching as
3752,he fumbled with the largest.
3753,"“Extendable Ears, look!”"
3754,"“Fantastic!” said Hermione, as Ron unraveled the long, flesh-"

3757,colored strings and began to feed them toward the bottom of the
3758,"door. “Oh, I hope the door isn’t Imperturbable —”"
3759,“No!” said Ron gleefully. “Listen!”
3760,They put their heads together and listened intently to the ends
3761,"of the strings, through which Malfoy’s voice could be heard loud"
3762,"and clear, as though a radio had been turned on."
3763,“. . . you know how to fix it?”
3764,"“Possibly,” said Borgin, in a tone that suggested he was unwill-"
3765,"ing to commit himself. “I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you"
3766,bring it into the shop?”
3767,"“I can’t,” said Malfoy. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell"
3768,me how to do it.”
3769,Harry saw Borgin lick his lips nervously.
3770,"“Well, without seeing it, I must say it will be a very difficult job,"
3771,perhaps impossible. I couldn’t guarantee anything.”
3772,"“No?” said Malfoy, and Harry knew, just by his tone, that Mal-"
3773,foy was sneering. “Perhaps this will make you more confident.”
3774,He moved toward Borgin and was blocked from view by the
3775,"cabinet. Harry, Ron, and Hermione shuffled sideways to try and"
3776,"keep him in sight, but all they could see was Borgin, looking very"
3777,frightened.
3778,"“Tell anyone,” said Malfoy, “and there will be retribution. You"
3779,know Fenrir Greyback? He’s a family friend. He’ll be dropping in
3780,from time to time to make sure you’re giving the problem your full
3781,attention.”
3782,“There will be no need for —”
3783,"“I’ll decide that,” said Malfoy. “Well, I’d better be off. And don’t"
3784,"forget to keep that one safe, I’ll need it.”"
3785,“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?”
3786, 125   
3787,CHAPTER SIX
3788,"“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how would I"
3789,look carrying that down the street? Just don’t sell it.”
3790,“Of course not . . . sir.”
3791,Borgin made a bow as deep as the one Harry had once seen him
3792,give Lucius Malfoy.
3793,"“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother,"
3794,understand?”
3795,"“Naturally, naturally,” murmured Borgin, bowing again."
3796,"Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy"
3797,stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He
3798,"passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the"
3799,"cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin"
3800,remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked
3801,worried.
3802,"“What was that about?” whispered Ron, reeling in the Extend-"
3803,able Ears.
3804,"“Dunno,” said Harry, thinking hard. “He wants something"
3805,mended . . . and he wants to reserve something in there. . . . Could
3806,you see what he pointed at when he said ‘that one’?”
3807,"“No, he was behind that cabinet —”"
3808,"“You two stay here,” whispered Hermione."
3809,“What are you — ?”
3810,But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak.
3811,"She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched"
3812,"into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the"
3813,Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings
3814,to Harry.
3815,"“Hello, horrible morning, isn’t it?” Hermione said brightly to"
3816,"Borgin, who did not answer, but cast her a suspicious look. Hum-"

3819,"ming cheerily, Hermione strolled through the jumble of objects on"
3820,display.
3821,"“Is this necklace for sale?” she asked, pausing beside a glass-"
3822,fronted case.
3823,"“If you’ve got one and a half thousand Galleons,” said Mr."
3824,Borgin coldly.
3825,"“Oh — er — no, I haven’t got quite that much,” said Hermi-"
3826,"one, walking on. “And . . . what about this lovely — um — skull?”"
3827,“Sixteen Galleons.”
3828,"“So it’s for sale, then? It isn’t being . . . kept for anyone?”"
3829,Mr. Borgin squinted at her. Harry had the nasty feeling he knew
3830,exactly what Hermione was up to. Apparently Hermione felt she
3831,had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the
3832,winds.
3833,"“The thing is, that — er — boy who was in here just now,"
3834,"Draco Malfoy, well, he’s a friend of mine, and I want to get him a"
3835,"birthday present, but if he’s already reserved anything, I obviously"
3836,"don’t want to get him the same thing, so . . . um . . .”"
3837,"It was a pretty lame story in Harry’s opinion, and apparently"
3838,Borgin thought so too.
3839,"“Out,” he said sharply. “Get out!”"
3840,"Hermione did not wait to be asked twice, but hurried to the"
3841,"door with Borgin at her heels. As the bell tinkled again, Borgin"
3842,slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign.
3843,"“Ah well,” said Ron, throwing the cloak back over Hermione."
3844,"“Worth a try, but you were a bit obvious —”"
3845,"“Well, next time you can show me how it’s done, Master of"
3846,Mystery!” she snapped.

3860,H          arry spent a lot of the last week of the holidays ponder-
3861,ing the meaning of Malfoy’s behavior in Knockturn
3862,Alley. What disturbed him most was the satisfied look on Malfoy’s
3863,face as he had left the shop. Nothing that made Malfoy look that
3864,"happy could be good news. To his slight annoyance, however, nei-"
3865,ther Ron nor Hermione seemed quite as curious about Malfoy’s

3867,cussing it after a few days.
3868,"“Yes, I’ve already agreed it was fishy, Harry,” said Hermione a lit-"
3869,tle impatiently. She was sitting on the windowsill in Fred and
3870,George’s room with her feet up on one of the cardboard boxes and
3871,had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of Advanced
3872,Rune Translation. “But haven’t we agreed there could be a lot of
3873,explanations?”
3874,"“Maybe he’s broken his Hand of Glory,” said Ron vaguely, as he"
3875, 129   

3877,attempted to straighten his broomstick’s bent tail twigs. “Remem-
3878,ber that shriveled-up arm Malfoy had?”
3879,"“But what about when he said, ‘Don’t forget to keep that one"
3880,safe’?” asked Harry for the umpteenth time. “That sounded to me
3881,"like Borgin’s got another one of the broken objects, and Malfoy"
3882,wants both.”
3883,"“You reckon?” said Ron, now trying to scrape some dirt off his"
3884,broom handle.
3885,"“Yeah, I do,” said Harry. When neither Ron nor Hermione an-"
3886,"swered, he said, “Malfoy’s father’s in Azkaban. Don’t you think"
3887,Malfoy’d like revenge?”
3888,"Ron looked up, blinking."
3889,"“Malfoy, revenge? What can he do about it?”"
3890,"“That’s my point, I don’t know!” said Harry, frustrated. “But he’s"
3891,up to something and I think we should take it seriously. His father’s

3896,"“Your scar’s not hurting again, is it?” asked Ron nervously."
3897,"“He’s a Death Eater,” said Harry slowly. “He’s replaced his father"
3898,as a Death Eater!”
3899,There was a silence; then Ron erupted in laughter. “Malfoy? He’s
3900,"sixteen, Harry! You think You-Know-Who would let Malfoy join?”"
3901,"“It seems very unlikely, Harry,” said Hermione in a repressive"
3902,sort of voice. “What makes you think — ?”
3903,"“In Madam Malkin’s. She didn’t touch him, but he yelled and"

3920,"Annoyed, but absolutely convinced he was right, Harry snatched"
3921,up a pile of filthy Quidditch robes and left the room; Mrs. Weasley

3924,who was returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered

3926,"“I wouldn’t go in the kitchen just now,” she warned him."
3927,“There’s a lot of Phlegm around.”
3928,“I’ll be careful not to slip in it.” Harry smiled.
3929,"Sure enough, when he entered the kitchen it was to find Fleur"
3930,"sitting at the kitchen table, in full flow about plans for her wedding"
3931,"to Bill, while Mrs. Weasley kept watch over a pile of self-peeling"

3939,"“Ah, Harry!” said Mrs. Weasley loudly, cutting across Fleur’s"

3947,"“She has let ’erself go, zat Tonks,” Fleur mused, examining her"

3949,if you ask —”
3950,"“Yes, thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley tartly, cutting across Fleur"
3951,"again. “You’d better get on, Harry, I want the trunks ready tonight,"
3952,"if possible, so we don’t have the usual last-minute scramble.”"
3953,"And in fact, their departure the following morning was smoother"
3954,than usual. The Ministry cars glided up to the front of the Burrow
3955,"to find them waiting, trunks packed; Hermione’s cat, Crookshanks,"
3956,"safely enclosed in his traveling basket; and Hedwig; Ron’s owl, Pig-"
3957,"widgeon; and Ginny’s new purple Pygmy Puff, Arnold, in cages."
3958,"“Au revoir, ’Arry,” said Fleur throatily, kissing him good-bye."
3959,"Ron hurried forward, looking hopeful, but Ginny stuck out her"
3960,"foot and Ron fell, sprawling in the dust at Fleur’s feet. Furious, red-"

3962,good-bye.
3963,There was no cheerful Hagrid waiting for them at King’s Cross

3967,"“Quick, quick, through the barrier,” said Mrs. Weasley, who"

3972,"She looked inquiringly at one of the Aurors, who nodded briefly,"
3973,"seized Harry’s upper arm, and attempted to steer him toward the"
3974,barrier between platforms nine and ten.
3975,"“I can walk, thanks,” said Harry irritably, jerking his arm out of"
3976,"the Auror’s grip. He pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier,"
3977,"ignoring his silent companion, and found himself, a second later,"
3978,"standing on platform nine and three-quarters, where the scarlet"
3979,Hogwarts Express stood belching steam over the crowd.
3980,Hermione and the Weasleys joined him within seconds. With-

3982,"Ron and Hermione to follow him up the platform, looking for an"
3983,empty compartment.
3984,"“We can’t, Harry,” said Hermione, looking apologetic. “Ron and"

3990,"“Well, have a lovely term, Ron. . . .”"
3991,"“Mr. Weasley, can I have a quick word?” said Harry, making up"
3992,his mind on the spur of the moment.
3993,"“Of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked slightly surprised,"
3994,but followed Harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless.
3995,Harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclu-
3996,"sion that, if he was to tell anyone, Mr. Weasley was the right per-"
3997,"son; firstly, because he worked at the Ministry and was therefore in"
3998,"the best position to make further investigations, and secondly,"
3999, 133   
4000,CHAPTER SEVEN
4001,because he thought that there was not too much risk of Mr.
4002,Weasley exploding with anger.
4003,He could see Mrs. Weasley and the grim-faced Auror casting the
4004,pair of them suspicious looks as they moved away.
4005,"“When we were in Diagon Alley,” Harry began, but Mr. Weasley"
4006,forestalled him with a grimace.
4007,"“Am I about to discover where you, Ron, and Hermione disap-"
4008,peared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of Fred
4009,and George’s shop?”
4010,“How did you — ?”
4011,"“Harry, please. You’re talking to the man who raised Fred and"
4012,George.”
4013,"“Er . . . yeah, all right, we weren’t in the back room.”"
4014,"“Very well, then, let’s hear the worst.”"
4015,"“Well, we followed Draco Malfoy. We used my Invisibility"
4016,Cloak.”
4017,"“Did you have any particular reason for doing so, or was it a"
4018,mere whim?”
4019,"“Because I thought Malfoy was up to something,” said Harry, dis-"
4020,regarding Mr. Weasley’s look of mingled exasperation and amuse-
4021,ment. “He’d given his mother the slip and I wanted to know why.”
4022,"“Of course you did,” said Mr. Weasley, sounding resigned."
4023,“Well? Did you find out why?”
4024,"“He went into Borgin and Burkes,” said Harry, “and started bul-"
4025,"lying the bloke in there, Borgin, to help him fix something. And he"
4026,said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him. He made it
4027,sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing. Like
4028,they were a pair. And . . .”
4029,Harry took a deep breath.
4030, 134  
4031,THE SLUG CLUB
4032,“There’s something else. We saw Malfoy jump about a mile
4033,when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm. I think he’s been
4034,branded with the Dark Mark. I think he’s replaced his father as a
4035,Death Eater.”
4036,"Mr. Weasley looked taken aback. After a moment he said,"
4037,"“Harry, I doubt whether You-Know-Who would allow a sixteen-"
4038,year-old —”
4039,“Does anyone really know what You-Know-Who would or
4040,"wouldn’t do?” asked Harry angrily. “Mr. Weasley, I’m sorry, but"
4041,"isn’t it worth investigating? If Malfoy wants something fixing, and"
4042,"he needs to threaten Borgin to get it done, it’s probably something"
4043,"Dark or dangerous, isn’t it?”"
4044,"“I doubt it, to be honest, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley slowly. “You"
4045,"see, when Lucius Malfoy was arrested, we raided his house. We"
4046,took away everything that might have been dangerous.”
4047,"“I think you missed something,” said Harry stubbornly."
4048,"“Well, maybe,” said Mr. Weasley, but Harry could tell that Mr."
4049,Weasley was humoring him.
4050,There was a whistle behind them; nearly everyone had boarded
4051,the train and the doors were closing.
4052,"“You’d better hurry,” said Mr. Weasley, as Mrs. Weasley cried,"
4053,"“Harry, quickly!”"
4054,He hurried forward and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley helped him load
4055,his trunk onto the train.
4056,"“Now, dear, you’re coming to us for Christmas, it’s all fixed with"
4057,"Dumbledore, so we’ll see you quite soon,” said Mrs. Weasley"
4058,"through the window, as Harry slammed the door shut behind him"
4059,and the train began to move. “You make sure you look after your-
4060,self and —”
4061, 135  
4062,CHAPTER SEVEN
4063,The train was gathering speed.
4064,“— be good and —”
4065,She was jogging to keep up now.
4066,“— stay safe!”
4067,Harry waved until the train had turned a corner and Mr. and
4068,"Mrs. Weasley were lost to view, then turned to see where the others"
4069,had got to. He supposed Ron and Hermione were cloistered in the
4070,"prefects’ carriage, but Ginny was a little way along the corridor,"
4071,"chatting to some friends. He made his way toward her, dragging his"
4072,trunk.
4073,People stared shamelessly as he approached. They even pressed
4074,their faces against the windows of their compartments to get a look
4075,at him. He had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and
4076,gawping he would have to endure this term after all the “Chosen
4077,"One” rumors in the Daily Prophet, but he did not enjoy the sensa-"
4078,tion of standing in a very bright spotlight. He tapped Ginny on the
4079,shoulder.
4080,“Fancy trying to find a compartment?”
4081,"“I can’t, Harry, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny brightly. “See"
4082,you later.”
4083,"“Right,” said Harry. He felt a strange twinge of annoyance as she"
4084,"walked away, her long red hair dancing behind her; he had become"
4085,so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost
4086,"forgotten that Ginny did not hang around with him, Ron, and"
4087,Hermione while at school. Then he blinked and looked around:
4088,He was surrounded by mesmerized girls.
4089,"“Hi, Harry!” said a familiar voice from behind him."
4090,"“Neville!” said Harry in relief, turning to see a round-faced boy"
4091,struggling toward him.
4092, 136   
4093,THE SLUG CLUB
4094,"“Hello, Harry,” said a girl with long hair and large misty eyes,"
4095,who was just behind Neville.
4096,"“Luna, hi, how are you?”"
4097,"“Very well, thank you,” said Luna. She was clutching a magazine"
4098,to her chest; large letters on the front announced that there was a
4099,pair of free Spectrespecs inside.
4100,"“Quibbler still going strong, then?” asked Harry, who felt a cer-"
4101,"tain fondness for the magazine, having given it an exclusive inter-"
4102,view the previous year.
4103,"“Oh yes, circulation’s well up,” said Luna happily."
4104,"“Let’s find seats,” said Harry, and the three of them set off along"
4105,the train through hordes of silently staring students. At last they
4106,"found an empty compartment, and Harry hurried inside gratefully."
4107,"“They’re even staring at us!” said Neville, indicating himself and"
4108,Luna. “Because we’re with you!”
4109,"“They’re staring at you because you were at the Ministry too,”"
4110,"said Harry, as he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack. “Our"
4111,"little adventure there was all over the Daily Prophet, you must’ve"
4112,seen it.”
4113,"“Yes, I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity,”"
4114,"said Neville, “but she was really pleased. Says I’m starting to live up"
4115,"to my dad at long last. She bought me a new wand, look!”"
4116,He pulled it out and showed it to Harry.
4117,"“Cherry and unicorn hair,” he said proudly. “We think it was"
4118,"one of the last Ollivander ever sold, he vanished next day — oi,"
4119,"come back here, Trevor!”"
4120,And he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad as it made one of
4121,its frequent bids for freedom.
4122,"“Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year, Harry?” asked Luna,"
4123, 137   
4124,CHAPTER SEVEN
4125,who was detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacles from the middle
4126,of The Quibbler.
4127,"“No point now we’ve got rid of Umbridge, is there?” said Harry,"
4128,sitting down. Neville bumped his head against the seat as he
4129,emerged from under it. He looked most disappointed.
4130,“I liked the D.A.! I learned loads with you!”
4131,"“I enjoyed the meetings too,” said Luna serenely. “It was like"
4132,having friends.”
4133,This was one of those uncomfortable things Luna often said and
4134,which made Harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrass-
4135,"ment. Before he could respond, however, there was a disturbance"
4136,outside their compartment door; a group of fourth-year girls was
4137,whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass.
4138,“You ask him!”
4139,"“No, you!”"
4140,“I’ll do it!”
4141,"And one of them, a bold-looking girl with large dark eyes, a"
4142,"prominent chin, and long black hair pushed her way through the"
4143,door.
4144,"“Hi, Harry, I’m Romilda, Romilda Vane,” she said loudly and"
4145,confidently. “Why don’t you join us in our compartment? You
4146,"don’t have to sit with them,” she added in a stage whisper, indicat-"
4147,"ing Neville’s bottom, which was sticking out from under the seat"
4148,"again as he groped around for Trevor, and Luna, who was now"
4149,"wearing her free Spectrespecs, which gave her the look of a de-"
4150,"mented, multicolored owl."
4151,"“They’re friends of mine,” said Harry coldly."
4152,"“Oh,” said the girl, looking very surprised. “Oh. Okay.”"
4153,"And she withdrew, sliding the door closed behind her."
4154, 138  
4155,THE SLUG CLUB
4156,"“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said Luna,"
4157,once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty.
4158,"“You are cool,” said Harry shortly. “None of them was at the"
4159,Ministry. They didn’t fight with me.”
4160,"“That’s a very nice thing to say,” beamed Luna. Then she pushed"
4161,her Spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read The
4162,Quibbler.
4163,"“We didn’t face him, though,” said Neville, emerging from un-"
4164,der the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resigned-looking
4165,Trevor in his hand. “You did. You should hear my gran talk about
4166,you. ‘That Harry Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry
4167,of Magic put together!’ She’d give anything to have you as a grand-
4168,son. . . .”
4169,Harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to
4170,O.W.L. results as soon as he could. While Neville recited his grades
4171,and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a Trans-
4172,"figuration N.E.W.T. with only an “Acceptable,” Harry watched him"
4173,without really listening.
4174,Neville’s childhood had been blighted by Voldemort just as
4175,"much as Harry’s had, but Neville had no idea how close he had"
4176,come to having Harry’s destiny. The prophecy could have referred
4177,"to either of them, yet, for his own inscrutable reasons, Voldemort"
4178,had chosen to believe that Harry was the one meant.
4179,"Had Voldemort chosen Neville, it would be Neville sitting op-"
4180,posite Harry bearing the lightning-shaped scar and the weight of
4181,the prophecy. . . . Or would it? Would Neville’s mother have died
4182,"to save him, as Lily had died for Harry? Surely she would. . . . But"
4183,what if she had been unable to stand between her son and Volde-
4184,mort? Would there then have been no “Chosen One” at all? An
4185, 139   
4186,CHAPTER SEVEN
4187,empty seat where Neville now sat and a scarless Harry who would
4188,"have been kissed good-bye by his own mother, not Ron’s?"
4189,"“You all right, Harry? You look funny,” said Neville."
4190,Harry started. “Sorry — I —”
4191,"“Wrackspurt got you?” asked Luna sympathetically, peering at"
4192,Harry through her enormous colored spectacles.
4193,“I — what?”
4194,“A Wrackspurt . . . They’re invisible. They float in through your
4195,"ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said. “I thought I felt one"
4196,zooming around in here.”
4197,"She flapped her hands at thin air, as though beating off large"
4198,invisible moths. Harry and Neville caught each other’s eyes and
4199,hastily began to talk of Quidditch.
4200,The weather beyond the train windows was as patchy as it had
4201,"been all summer; they passed through stretches of the chilling mist,"
4202,"then out into weak, clear sunlight. It was during one of the clear"
4203,"spells, when the sun was visible almost directly overhead, that Ron"
4204,and Hermione entered the compartment at last.
4205,"“Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up, I’m starving,” said Ron"
4206,"longingly, slumping into the seat beside Harry and rubbing his"
4207,"stomach. “Hi, Neville. Hi, Luna. Guess what?” he added, turning"
4208,to Harry. “Malfoy’s not doing prefect duty. He’s just sitting in his
4209,"compartment with the other Slytherins, we saw him when we"
4210,passed.”
4211,"Harry sat up straight, interested. It was not like Malfoy to pass"
4212,"up the chance to demonstrate his power as prefect, which he had"
4213,happily abused all the previous year.
4214,“What did he do when he saw you?”
4215,"“The usual,” said Ron indifferently, demonstrating a rude hand"
4216, 140   
4217,THE SLUG CLUB
4218,"gesture. “Not like him, though, is it? Well — that is” — he did the"
4219,hand gesture again — “but why isn’t he out there bullying first
4220,years?
4221,"“Dunno,” said Harry, but his mind was racing. Didn’t this look"
4222,as though Malfoy had more important things on his mind than
4223,bullying younger students?
4224,"“Maybe he preferred the Inquisitorial Squad,” said Hermione."
4225,“Maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that.”
4226,"“I don’t think so,” said Harry. “I think he’s —”"
4227,"But before he could expound on his theory, the compartment"
4228,door slid open again and a breathless third-year girl stepped inside.
4229,“I’m supposed to deliver these to Neville Longbottom and Harry
4230,"P-Potter,” she faltered, as her eyes met Harry’s and she turned scar-"
4231,let. She was holding out two scrolls of parchment tied with violet
4232,"ribbon. Perplexed, Harry and Neville took the scroll addressed to"
4233,each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment.
4234,"“What is it?” Ron demanded, as Harry unrolled his."
4235,"“An invitation,” said Harry."
4236,"Harry,"
4237,I would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of
4238,lunch in compartment C.
4239,"Sincerely,"
4240,Professor H. E. F. Slughorn
4241,"“Who’s Professor Slughorn?” asked Neville, looking perplexedly"
4242,at his own invitation.
4243,"“New teacher,” said Harry. “Well, I suppose we’ll have to go,"
4244,won’t we?”
4245, 141    
4246,CHAPTER SEVEN
4247,"“But what does he want me for?” asked Neville nervously, as"
4248,though he was expecting detention.
4249,"“No idea,” said Harry, which was not entirely true, though he"
4250,"had no proof yet that his hunch was correct. “Listen,” he added,"
4251,"seized by a sudden brain wave, “let’s go under the Invisibility"
4252,"Cloak, then we might get a good look at Malfoy on the way, see"
4253,what he’s up to.”
4254,"This idea, however, came to nothing: The corridors, which were"
4255,"packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley, were im-"
4256,possible to negotiate while wearing the cloak. Harry stowed it re-
4257,"gretfully back in his bag, reflecting that it would have been nice to"
4258,"wear it just to avoid all the staring, which seemed to have increased"
4259,in intensity even since he had last walked down the train. Every
4260,"now and then, students would hurtle out of their compartments"
4261,"to get a better look at him. The exception was Cho Chang, who"
4262,darted into her compartment when she saw Harry coming. As
4263,"Harry passed the window, he saw her deep in determined conver-"
4264,"sation with her friend Marietta, who was wearing a very thick layer"
4265,of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pim-
4266,"ples still etched across her face. Smirking slightly, Harry pushed on."
4267,"When they reached compartment C, they saw at once that"
4268,"they were not Slughorn’s only invitees, although judging by the"
4269,"enthusiasm of Slughorn’s welcome, Harry was the most warmly"
4270,anticipated.
4271,"“Harry, m’boy!” said Slughorn, jumping up at the sight of him"
4272,so that his great velvet-covered belly seemed to fill all the remain-
4273,ing space in the compartment. His shiny bald head and great sil-
4274,very mustache gleamed as brightly in the sunlight as the golden
4275, 142  
4276,THE SLUG CLUB
4277,"buttons on his waistcoat. “Good to see you, good to see you! And"
4278,you must be Mr. Longbottom!”
4279,"Neville nodded, looking scared. At a gesture from Slughorn,"
4280,"they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seats,"
4281,which were nearest the door. Harry glanced around at their fellow
4282,"guests. He recognized a Slytherin from their year, a tall black boy"
4283,"with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes; there were also two"
4284,"seventh-year boys Harry did not know and, squashed in the corner"
4285,beside Slughorn and looking as though she was not entirely sure
4286,"how she had got there, Ginny."
4287,"“Now, do you know everyone?” Slughorn asked Harry and"
4288,"Neville. “Blaise Zabini is in your year, of course —”"
4289,"Zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting, nor did"
4290,Harry or Neville: Gryffindor and Slytherin students loathed each
4291,other on principle.
4292,"“This is Cormac McLaggen, perhaps you’ve come across each"
4293,other — ? No?”
4294,"McLaggen, a large, wiry-haired youth, raised a hand, and Harry"
4295,and Neville nodded back at him.
4296,"“— and this is Marcus Belby, I don’t know whether — ?”"
4297,"Belby, who was thin and nervous-looking, gave a strained smile."
4298,“— and this charming young lady tells me she knows you!”
4299,Slughorn finished.
4300,Ginny grimaced at Harry and Neville from behind Slughorn’s
4301,back.
4302,"“Well now, this is most pleasant,” said Slughorn cozily. “A"
4303,"chance to get to know you all a little better. Here, take a napkin."
4304,"I’ve packed my own lunch; the trolley, as I remember it, is heavy on"
4305, 143  
4306,CHAPTER SEVEN
4307,"licorice wands, and a poor old man’s digestive system isn’t quite up"
4308,"to such things. . . . Pheasant, Belby?”"
4309,Belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant.
4310,“I was just telling young Marcus here that I had the pleasure of
4311,"teaching his Uncle Damocles,” Slughorn told Harry and Neville,"
4312,"now passing around a basket of rolls. “Outstanding wizard, out-"
4313,"standing, and his Order of Merlin most well-deserved. Do you see"
4314,"much of your uncle, Marcus?”"
4315,"Unfortunately, Belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheas-"
4316,"ant; in his haste to answer Slughorn he swallowed too fast, turned"
4317,"purple, and began to choke."
4318,"“Anapneo,” said Slughorn calmly, pointing his wand at Belby,"
4319,whose airway seemed to clear at once.
4320,"“Not . . . not much of him, no,” gasped Belby, his eyes streaming."
4321,"“Well, of course, I daresay he’s busy,” said Slughorn, looking"
4322,questioningly at Belby. “I doubt he invented the Wolfsbane Potion
4323,without considerable hard work!”
4324,"“I suppose . . .” said Belby, who seemed afraid to take another"
4325,bite of pheasant until he was sure that Slughorn had finished with
4326,"him. “Er . . . he and my dad don’t get on very well, you see, so I"
4327,don’t really know much about . . .”
4328,His voice tailed away as Slughorn gave him a cold smile and
4329,turned to McLaggen instead.
4330,"“Now, you, Cormac,” said Slughorn, “I happen to know you see"
4331,"a lot of your Uncle Tiberius, because he has a rather splendid pic-"
4332,"ture of the two of you hunting nogtails in, I think, Norfolk?”"
4333,"“Oh, yeah, that was fun, that was,” said McLaggen. “We went"
4334,with Bertie Higgs and Rufus Scrimgeour — this was before he be-
4335,"came Minister, obviously —”"
4336, 144   
4337,THE SLUG CLUB
4338,"“Ah, you know Bertie and Rufus too?” beamed Slughorn, now"
4339,"offering around a small tray of pies; somehow, Belby was missed"
4340,out. “Now tell me . . .”
4341,It was as Harry had suspected. Everyone here seemed to have
4342,been invited because they were connected to somebody well-
4343,"known or influential — everyone except Ginny. Zabini, who was"
4344,"interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beau-"
4345,"tiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she"
4346,"had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteri-"
4347,ously and leaving her mounds of gold). It was Neville’s turn next:
4348,"This was a very uncomfortable ten minutes, for Neville’s parents,"
4349,"well-known Aurors, had been tortured into insanity by Bellatrix"
4350,Lestrange and a couple of Death Eater cronies. At the end of
4351,"Neville’s interview, Harry had the impression that Slughorn was"
4352,"reserving judgment on Neville, yet to see whether he had any of his"
4353,parents’ flair.
4354,"“And now,” said Slughorn, shifting massively in his seat with the"
4355,air of a compere introducing his star act. “Harry Potter! Where to
4356,begin? I feel I barely scratched the surface when we met over the
4357,summer!” He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was
4358,"a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant, then said,"
4359,"“ ‘The Chosen One,’ they’re calling you now!”"
4360,"Harry said nothing. Belby, McLaggen, and Zabini were all star-"
4361,ing at him.
4362,"“Of course,” said Slughorn, watching Harry closely, “there have"
4363,been rumors for years. . . . I remember when — well — after that
4364,terrible night — Lily — James — and you survived — and the
4365,word was that you must have powers beyond the ordinary —”
4366,Zabini gave a tiny little cough that was clearly supposed to
4367, 145 
4368,CHAPTER SEVEN
4369,indicate amused skepticism. An angry voice burst out from behind
4370,Slughorn.
4371,"“Yeah, Zabini, because you’re so talented . . . at posing. . . .”"
4372,"“Oh dear!” chuckled Slughorn comfortably, looking around at"
4373,"Ginny, who was glaring at Zabini around Slughorn’s great belly."
4374,"“You want to be careful, Blaise! I saw this young lady perform the"
4375,most marvelous Bat-Bogey Hex as I was passing her carriage! I
4376,wouldn’t cross her!”
4377,Zabini merely looked contemptuous.
4378,"“Anyway,” said Slughorn, turning back to Harry. “Such rumors"
4379,"this summer. Of course, one doesn’t know what to believe, the"
4380,"Prophet has been known to print inaccuracies, make mistakes —"
4381,"but there seems little doubt, given the number of witnesses, that"
4382,there was quite a disturbance at the Ministry and that you were
4383,there in the thick of it all!”
4384,"Harry, who could not see any way out of this without flatly"
4385,"lying, nodded but still said nothing. Slughorn beamed at him."
4386,"“So modest, so modest, no wonder Dumbledore is so fond —"
4387,"you were there, then? But the rest of the stories — so sensational, of"
4388,"course, one doesn’t know quite what to believe — this fabled"
4389,"prophecy, for instance —”"
4390,"“We never heard a prophecy,” said Neville, turning geranium"
4391,pink as he said it.
4392,"“That’s right,” said Ginny staunchly. “Neville and I were both"
4393,"there too, and all this ‘Chosen One’ rubbish is just the Prophet"
4394,making things up as usual.”
4395,"“You were both there too, were you?” said Slughorn with great"
4396,"interest, looking from Ginny to Neville, but both of them sat clam-"
4397,like before his encouraging smile.
4398, 146  
4399,THE SLUG CLUB
4400,"“Yes . . . well . . . it is true that the Prophet often exaggerates, of"
4401,"course. . . .” Slughorn said, sounding a little disappointed. “I re-"
4402,"member dear Gwenog telling me (Gwenog Jones, I mean, of"
4403,"course, Captain of the Holyhead Harpies) —”"
4404,"He meandered off into a long-winded reminiscence, but Harry"
4405,had the distinct impression that Slughorn had not finished with
4406,"him, and that he had not been convinced by Neville and Ginny."
4407,The afternoon wore on with more anecdotes about illustrious
4408,"wizards Slughorn had taught, all of whom had been delighted to"
4409,join what he called the “Slug Club” at Hogwarts. Harry could not
4410,"wait to leave, but couldn’t see how to do so politely. Finally the"
4411,train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sun-
4412,"set, and Slughorn looked around, blinking in the twilight."
4413,"“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t notice that"
4414,"they’d lit the lamps! You’d better go and change into your robes,"
4415,"all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book"
4416,"on nogtails. Harry, Blaise — any time you’re passing. Same goes"
4417,"for you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny. “Well, off you go, off you"
4418,go!”
4419,"As he pushed past Harry into the darkening corridor, Zabini"
4420,"shot him a filthy look that Harry returned with interest. He,"
4421,"Ginny, and Neville followed Zabini back along the train."
4422,"“I’m glad that’s over,” muttered Neville. “Strange man, isn’t he?”"
4423,"“Yeah, he is a bit,” said Harry, his eyes on Zabini. “How come"
4424,"you ended up in there, Ginny?”"
4425,"“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith,” said Ginny. “You remember"
4426,that idiot from Hufflepuff who was in the D.A.? He kept on and on
4427,asking about what happened at the Ministry and in the end he
4428,annoyed me so much I hexed him — when Slughorn came in I
4429, 147   
4430,CHAPTER SEVEN
4431,"thought I was going to get detention, but he just thought it was a"
4432,"really good hex and invited me to lunch! Mad, eh?”"
4433,“Better reason for inviting someone than because their mother’s
4434,"famous,” said Harry, scowling at the back of Zabini’s head, “or be-"
4435,cause their uncle —”
4436,"But he broke off. An idea had just occurred to him, a reckless"
4437,"but potentially wonderful idea. . . . In a minute’s time, Zabini was"
4438,going to reenter the Slytherin sixth-year compartment and Malfoy
4439,"would be sitting there, thinking himself unheard by anybody ex-"
4440,"cept fellow Slytherins. . . . If Harry could only enter, unseen, be-"
4441,"hind him, what might he not see or hear? True, there was little of"
4442,the journey left — Hogsmeade Station had to be less than half an
4443,"hour away, judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the"
4444,windows — but nobody else seemed prepared to take Harry’s sus-
4445,"picions seriously, so it was down to him to prove them."
4446,"“I’ll see you two later,” said Harry under his breath, pulling out"
4447,his Invisibility Cloak and flinging it over himself.
4448,“But what’re you — ?” asked Neville.
4449,"“Later!” whispered Harry, darting after Zabini as quietly as pos-"
4450,"sible, though the rattling of the train made such caution almost"
4451,pointless.
4452,The corridors were almost completely empty now. Nearly every-
4453,one had returned to their carriages to change into their school
4454,robes and pack up their possessions. Though he was as close as he
4455,"could get to Zabini without touching him, Harry was not quick"
4456,enough to slip into the compartment when Zabini opened the
4457,door. Zabini was already sliding it shut when Harry hastily stuck
4458,out his foot to prevent it closing.
4459, 148  
4460,THE SLUG CLUB
4461,“What’s wrong with this thing?” said Zabini angrily as he
4462,smashed the sliding door repeatedly into Harry’s foot.
4463,"Harry seized the door and pushed it open, hard; Zabini, still"
4464,"clinging on to the handle, toppled over sideways into Gregory"
4465,"Goyle’s lap, and in the ensuing ruckus, Harry darted into the com-"
4466,"partment, leapt onto Zabini’s temporarily empty seat, and hoisted"
4467,himself up into the luggage rack. It was fortunate that Goyle and
4468,"Zabini were snarling at each other, drawing all eyes onto them, for"
4469,Harry was quite sure his feet and ankles had been revealed as the
4470,"cloak had flapped around them; indeed, for one horrible moment"
4471,he thought he saw Malfoy’s eyes follow his trainer as it whipped up-
4472,ward out of sight. But then Goyle slammed the door shut and flung
4473,"Zabini off him; Zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled,"
4474,"Vincent Crabbe returned to his comic, and Malfoy, sniggering, lay"
4475,back down across two seats with his head in Pansy Parkinson’s lap.
4476,Harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that
4477,"every inch of him remained hidden, and watched Pansy stroke the"
4478,"sleek blond hair off Malfoy’s forehead, smirking as she did so, as"
4479,though anyone would have loved to have been in her place. The
4480,lanterns swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over
4481,the scene: Harry could read every word of Crabbe’s comic directly
4482,below him.
4483,"“So, Zabini,” said Malfoy, “what did Slughorn want?”"
4484,"“Just trying to make up to well-connected people,” said Zabini,"
4485,who was still glowering at Goyle. “Not that he managed to find
4486,many.”
4487,This information did not seem to please Malfoy.
4488,“Who else had he invited?” he demanded.
4489, 149   
4490,CHAPTER SEVEN
4491,"“McLaggen from Gryffindor,” said Zabini."
4492,"“Oh yeah, his uncle’s big in the Ministry,” said Malfoy."
4493,"“— someone else called Belby, from Ravenclaw —”"
4494,"“Not him, he’s a prat!” said Pansy."
4495,"“— and Longbottom, Potter, and that Weasley girl,” finished"
4496,Zabini.
4497,"Malfoy sat up very suddenly, knocking Pansy’s hand aside."
4498,“He invited Longbottom?”
4499,"“Well, I assume so, as Longbottom was there,” said Zabini"
4500,indifferently.
4501,“What’s Longbottom got to interest Slughorn?”
4502,Zabini shrugged.
4503,"“Potter, precious Potter, obviously he wanted a look at ‘the Cho-"
4504,"sen One,’ ” sneered Malfoy, “but that Weasley girl! What’s so special"
4505,about her?”
4506,"“A lot of boys like her,” said Pansy, watching Malfoy out of the"
4507,corner of her eyes for his reaction. “Even you think she’s good-
4508,"looking, don’t you, Blaise, and we all know how hard you are to"
4509,please!”
4510,“I wouldn’t touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever
4511,"she looked like,” said Zabini coldly, and Pansy looked pleased."
4512,Malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the
4513,stroking of his hair.
4514,"“Well, I pity Slughorn’s taste. Maybe he’s going a bit senile."
4515,"Shame, my father always said he was a good wizard in his day. My"
4516,father used to be a bit of a favorite of his. Slughorn probably hasn’t
4517,"heard I’m on the train, or —”"
4518,"“I wouldn’t bank on an invitation,” said Zabini. “He asked me"
4519,about Nott’s father when I first arrived. They used to be old
4520, 150   
4521,THE SLUG CLUB
4522,"friends, apparently, but when he heard he’d been caught at the"
4523,"Ministry he didn’t look happy, and Nott didn’t get an invitation,"
4524,did he? I don’t think Slughorn’s interested in Death Eaters.”
4525,"Malfoy looked angry, but forced out a singularly humorless"
4526,laugh.
4527,"“Well, who cares what he’s interested in? What is he, when you"
4528,come down to it? Just some stupid teacher.” Malfoy yawned osten-
4529,"tatiously. “I mean, I might not even be at Hogwarts next year,"
4530,what’s it matter to me if some fat old has-been likes me or not?”
4531,"“What do you mean, you might not be at Hogwarts next year?”"
4532,"said Pansy indignantly, ceasing grooming Malfoy at once."
4533,"“Well, you never know,” said Malfoy with the ghost of a smirk."
4534,“I might have — er — moved on to bigger and better things.”
4535,"Crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak, Harry’s heart be-"
4536,gan to race. What would Ron and Hermione say about this?
4537,Crabbe and Goyle were gawping at Malfoy; apparently they had
4538,had no inkling of any plans to move on to bigger and better things.
4539,Even Zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty fea-
4540,"tures. Pansy resumed the slow stroking of Malfoy’s hair, looking"
4541,dumbfounded.
4542,“Do you mean — Him?”
4543,Malfoy shrugged.
4544,"“Mother wants me to complete my education, but personally, I"
4545,"don’t see it as that important these days. I mean, think about it. . . ."
4546,"When the Dark Lord takes over, is he going to care how many"
4547,O.W.L.s or N.E.W.T.s anyone’s got? Of course he isn’t. . . . It’ll be all
4548,"about the kind of service he received, the level of devotion he was"
4549,shown.”
4550,“And you think you’ll be able to do something for him?” asked
4551, 151  
4552,CHAPTER SEVEN
4553,Zabini scathingly. “Sixteen years old and not even fully qualified
4554,yet?”
4555,"“I’ve just said, haven’t I? Maybe he doesn’t care if I’m qualified."
4556,Maybe the job he wants me to do isn’t something that you need to
4557,"be qualified for,” said Malfoy quietly."
4558,Crabbe and Goyle were both sitting with their mouths open like
4559,gargoyles. Pansy was gazing down at Malfoy as though she had
4560,never seen anything so awe-inspiring.
4561,"“I can see Hogwarts,” said Malfoy, clearly relishing the effect he"
4562,had created as he pointed out of the blackened window. “We’d bet-
4563,ter get our robes on.”
4564,"Harry was so busy staring at Malfoy, he did not notice Goyle"
4565,"reaching up for his trunk; as he swung it down, it hit Harry hard"
4566,"on the side of the head. He let out an involuntary gasp of pain, and"
4567,"Malfoy looked up at the luggage rack, frowning."
4568,"Harry was not afraid of Malfoy, but he still did not much like"
4569,the idea of being discovered hiding under his Invisibility Cloak by
4570,a group of unfriendly Slytherins. Eyes still watering and head still
4571,"throbbing, he drew his wand, careful not to disarrange the cloak,"
4572,"and waited, breath held. To his relief, Malfoy seemed to decide that"
4573,"he had imagined the noise; he pulled on his robes like the others,"
4574,"locked his trunk, and as the train slowed to a jerky crawl, fastened"
4575,a thick new traveling cloak round his neck.
4576,Harry could see the corridors filling up again and hoped that
4577,Hermione and Ron would take his things out onto the platform
4578,for him; he was stuck where he was until the compartment had
4579,"quite emptied. At last, with a final lurch, the train came to a com-"
4580,plete halt. Goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out
4581, 152  
4582,THE SLUG CLUB
4583,"into a crowd of second years, punching them aside; Crabbe and"
4584,Zabini followed.
4585,"“You go on,” Malfoy told Pansy, who was waiting for him with"
4586,her hand held out as though hoping he would hold it. “I just want
4587,to check something.”
4588,Pansy left. Now Harry and Malfoy were alone in the compart-
4589,"ment. People were filing past, descending onto the dark platform."
4590,Malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the
4591,"blinds, so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in. He"
4592,then bent down over his trunk and opened it again.
4593,"Harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack, his heart"
4594,pumping a little faster. What had Malfoy wanted to hide from
4595,Pansy? Was he about to see the mysterious broken object it was so
4596,important to mend?
4597,“Petrificus Totalus!”
4598,"Without warning, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry, who was"
4599,"instantly paralyzed. As though in slow motion, he toppled out of"
4600,"the luggage rack and fell, with an agonizing, floor-shaking crash, at"
4601,"Malfoy’s feet, the Invisibility Cloak trapped beneath him, his"
4602,whole body revealed with his legs still curled absurdly into the
4603,cramped kneeling position. He couldn’t move a muscle; he could
4604,"only gaze up at Malfoy, who smiled broadly."
4605,"“I thought so,” he said jubilantly. “I heard Goyle’s trunk hit you."
4606,And I thought I saw something white flash through the air after
4607,Zabini came back. . . .”
4608,His eyes lingered for a moment upon Harry’s trainers.
4609,"“You didn’t hear anything I care about, Potter. But while I’ve got"
4610,you here . . .”
4611,  153   
4612,CHAPTER SEVEN
4613,"And he stamped, hard, on Harry’s face. Harry felt his nose break;"
4614,blood spurted everywhere.
4615,"“That’s from my father. Now, let’s see. . . .”"
4616,Malfoy dragged the cloak out from under Harry’s immobilized
4617,body and threw it over him.
4618,"“I don’t reckon they’ll find you till the train’s back in London,”"
4619,"he said quietly. “See you around, Potter . . . or not.”"
4620,"And taking care to tread on Harry’s fingers, Malfoy left the"
4621,compartment.
4622, 154   
4623,CHAPTER EIGHT
4624,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4625,H         arry could not move a muscle. He lay there beneath the
4626,"Invisibility Cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow,"
4627,"hot and wet, over his face, listening to the voices and footsteps in"
4628,"the corridor beyond. His immediate thought was that someone,"
4629,"surely, would check the compartments before the train departed"
4630,again. But at once came the dispiriting realization that even if
4631,"somebody looked into the compartment, he would be neither seen"
4632,nor heard. His best hope was that somebody else would walk in
4633,and step on him.
4634,"Harry had never hated Malfoy more than as he lay there, like an"
4635,"absurd turtle on its back, blood dripping sickeningly into his open"
4636,mouth. What a stupid situation to have landed himself in . . . and
4637,now the last few footsteps were dying away; everyone was shuffling
4638,along the dark platform outside; he could hear the scraping of
4639,trunks and the loud babble of talk.
4640,Ron and Hermione would think that he had left the train
4641, 155   
4642,CHAPTER EIGHT
4643,without them. Once they arrived at Hogwarts and took their places
4644,"in the Great Hall, looked up and down the Gryffindor table a few"
4645,"times, and finally realized that he was not there, he, no doubt,"
4646,would be halfway back to London.
4647,"He tried to make a sound, even a grunt, but it was impossible."
4648,"Then he remembered that some wizards, like Dumbledore, could"
4649,"perform spells without speaking, so he tried to summon his wand,"
4650,"which had fallen out of his hand, by saying the words “Accio"
4651,"Wand !” over and over again in his head, but nothing happened."
4652,He thought he could hear the rustling of the trees that sur-
4653,"rounded the lake, and the far-off hoot of an owl, but no hint of a"
4654,search being made or even (he despised himself slightly for hoping
4655,it) panicked voices wondering where Harry Potter had gone. A
4656,feeling of hopelessness spread through him as he imagined the con-
4657,voy of thestral-drawn carriages trundling up to the school and the
4658,muffled yells of laughter issuing from whichever carriage Malfoy
4659,"was riding in, where he could be recounting his attack on Harry to"
4660,"Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini, and Pansy Parkinson."
4661,"The train lurched, causing Harry to roll over onto his side. Now"
4662,he was staring at the dusty underside of the seats instead of the ceil-
4663,ing. The floor began to vibrate as the engine roared into life. The
4664,Express was leaving and nobody knew he was still on it. . . .
4665,Then he felt his Invisibility Cloak fly off him and a voice over-
4666,"head said, “Wotcher, Harry.”"
4667,There was a flash of red light and Harry’s body unfroze; he was
4668,"able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position, hastily"
4669,"wipe the blood off his bruised face with the back of his hand, and"
4670,"raise his head to look up at Tonks, who was holding the Invisibility"
4671,Cloak she had just pulled away.
4672, 156 
4673,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4674,"“We’d better get out of here, quickly,” she said, as the train win-"
4675,dows became obscured with steam and they began to move out of
4676,"the station. “Come on, we’ll jump.”"
4677,Harry hurried after her into the corridor. She pulled open the
4678,"train door and leapt onto the platform, which seemed to be sliding"
4679,underneath them as the train gathered momentum. He followed
4680,"her, staggered a little on landing, then straightened up in time to"
4681,"see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed, round the cor-"
4682,"ner, and disappear from view."
4683,The cold night air was soothing on his throbbing nose. Tonks
4684,was looking at him; he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been
4685,discovered in such a ridiculous position. Silently she handed him
4686,back the Invisibility Cloak.
4687,“Who did it?”
4688,"“Draco Malfoy,” said Harry bitterly. “Thanks for . . . well . . .”"
4689,"“No problem,” said Tonks, without smiling. From what Harry"
4690,"could see in the darkness, she was as mousy-haired and miserable-"
4691,looking as she had been when he had met her at the Burrow. “I can
4692,fix your nose if you stand still.”
4693,Harry did not think much of this idea; he had been intending to
4694,"visit Madam Pomfrey, the matron, in whom he had a little more"
4695,"confidence when it came to Healing Spells, but it seemed rude to"
4696,"say this, so he stayed stock-still and closed his eyes."
4697,"“Episkey,” said Tonks."
4698,"Harry’s nose felt very hot, and then very cold. He raised a hand"
4699,and felt it gingerly. It seemed to be mended.
4700,“Thanks a lot!”
4701,"“You’d better put that cloak back on, and we can walk up to the"
4702,"school,” said Tonks, still unsmiling. As Harry swung the cloak back"
4703,  157   
4704,CHAPTER EIGHT
4705,"over himself, she waved her wand; an immense silvery four-legged"
4706,creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness.
4707,"“Was that a Patronus?” asked Harry, who had seen Dumbledore"
4708,send messages like this.
4709,"“Yes, I’m sending word to the castle that I’ve got you or they’ll"
4710,"worry. Come on, we’d better not dawdle.”"
4711,They set off toward the lane that led to the school.
4712,“How did you find me?”
4713,“I noticed you hadn’t left the train and I knew you had that
4714,cloak. I thought you might be hiding for some reason. When I saw
4715,the blinds were drawn down on that compartment I thought I’d
4716,check.”
4717,"“But what are you doing here, anyway?” Harry asked."
4718,"“I’m stationed in Hogsmeade now, to give the school extra pro-"
4719,"tection,” said Tonks."
4720,"“Is it just you who’s stationed up here, or — ?”"
4721,"“No, Proudfoot, Savage, and Dawlish are here too.”"
4722,"“Dawlish, that Auror Dumbledore attacked last year?”"
4723,“That’s right.”
4724,"They trudged up the dark, deserted lane, following the freshly"
4725,made carriage tracks. Harry looked sideways at Tonks under his
4726,cloak. Last year she had been inquisitive (to the point of being a lit-
4727,"tle annoying at times), she had laughed easily, she had made jokes."
4728,Now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful.
4729,Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry? He re-
4730,flected uncomfortably that Hermione would have suggested he say
4731,"something consoling about Sirius to her, that it hadn’t been her"
4732,"fault at all, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it. He was far from"
4733,blaming her for Sirius’s death; it was no more her fault than anyone
4734, 158   
4735,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4736,"else’s (and much less than his), but he did not like talking about"
4737,Sirius if he could avoid it. And so they tramped on through the
4738,"cold night in silence, Tonks’s long cloak whispering on the ground"
4739,behind them.
4740,"Having always traveled there by carriage, Harry had never before"
4741,appreciated just how far Hogwarts was from Hogsmeade Station.
4742,With great relief he finally saw the tall pillars on either side of the
4743,"gates, each topped with a winged boar. He was cold, he was hun-"
4744,"gry, and he was quite keen to leave this new, gloomy Tonks behind."
4745,"But when he put out a hand to push open the gates, he found them"
4746,chained shut.
4747,"“Alohomora!” he said confidently, pointing his wand at the pad-"
4748,"lock, but nothing happened."
4749,"“That won’t work on these,” said Tonks. “Dumbledore bewitched"
4750,them himself.”
4751,Harry looked around.
4752,"“I could climb a wall,” he suggested."
4753,"“No, you couldn’t,” said Tonks flatly. “Anti-intruder jinxes on all"
4754,of them. Security’s been tightened a hundredfold this summer.”
4755,"“Well then,” said Harry, starting to feel annoyed at her lack of"
4756,"helpfulness, “I suppose I’ll just have to sleep out here and wait for"
4757,morning.”
4758,"“Someone’s coming down for you,” said Tonks. “Look.”"
4759,A lantern was bobbing at the distant foot of the castle. Harry
4760,was so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure Filch’s wheezy
4761,criticisms of his tardiness and rants about how his timekeeping
4762,would improve with the regular application of thumbscrews. It was
4763,"not until the glowing yellow light was ten feet away from them,"
4764,and Harry had pulled off his Invisibility Cloak so that he could be
4765, 159  
4766,CHAPTER EIGHT
4767,"seen, that he recognized, with a rush of pure loathing, the uplit"
4768,"hooked nose and long, black, greasy hair of Severus Snape."
4769,"“Well, well, well,” sneered Snape, taking out his wand and tap-"
4770,"ping the padlock once, so that the chains snaked backward and the"
4771,"gates creaked open. “Nice of you to turn up, Potter, although you"
4772,have evidently decided that the wearing of school robes would de-
4773,tract from your appearance.”
4774,"“I couldn’t change, I didn’t have my —” Harry began, but Snape"
4775,cut across him.
4776,"“There is no need to wait, Nymphadora, Potter is quite —"
4777,ah — safe in my hands.”
4778,"“I meant Hagrid to get the message,” said Tonks, frowning."
4779,"“Hagrid was late for the start-of-term feast, just like Potter here,"
4780,"so I took it instead. And incidentally,” said Snape, standing back"
4781,"to allow Harry to pass him, “I was interested to see your new"
4782,Patronus.”
4783,He shut the gates in her face with a loud clang and tapped the
4784,"chains with his wand again, so that they slithered, clinking, back"
4785,into place.
4786,"“I think you were better off with the old one,” said Snape, the"
4787,malice in his voice unmistakable. “The new one looks weak.”
4788,"As Snape swung the lantern about, Harry saw, fleetingly, a look"
4789,of shock and anger on Tonks’s face. Then she was covered in dark-
4790,ness once more.
4791,"“Good night,” Harry called to her over his shoulder, as he began"
4792,the walk up to the school with Snape. “Thanks for . . . everything.”
4793,"“See you, Harry.”"
4794,Snape did not speak for a minute or so. Harry felt as though his
4795,body was generating waves of hatred so powerful that it seemed
4796,  160  
4797,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4798,incredible that Snape could not feel them burning him. He had
4799,"loathed Snape from their first encounter, but Snape had placed him-"
4800,self forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of Harry’s for-
4801,"giveness by his attitude toward Sirius. Whatever Dumbledore said,"
4802,"Harry had had time to think over the summer, and had concluded"
4803,that Snape’s snide remarks to Sirius about remaining safely hidden
4804,while the rest of the Order of the Phoenix were off fighting Volde-
4805,mort had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius rushing off to
4806,"the Ministry the night that he had died. Harry clung to this notion,"
4807,"because it enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying, and"
4808,also because he knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was
4809,"dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness."
4810,"“Fifty points from Gryffindor for lateness, I think,” said Snape."
4811,"“And, let me see, another twenty for your Muggle attire. You know,"
4812,I don’t believe any House has ever been in negative figures this early
4813,in the term: We haven’t even started pudding. You might have set a
4814,"record, Potter.”"
4815,The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze
4816,"white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way"
4817,back to London than tell Snape why he was late.
4818,"“I suppose you wanted to make an entrance, did you?” Snape"
4819,continued. “And with no flying car available you decided that
4820,bursting into the Great Hall halfway through the feast ought to
4821,create a dramatic effect.”
4822,"Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might"
4823,"explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for"
4824,the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without
4825,anyone else listening.
4826,They reached the castle steps at last and as the great oaken front
4827, 161   
4828,CHAPTER EIGHT
4829,"doors swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall, a burst of talk"
4830,and laughter and of tinkling plates and glasses greeted them
4831,through the doors standing open into the Great Hall. Harry won-
4832,"dered whether he could slip his Invisibility Cloak back on, thereby"
4833,"gaining his seat at the long Gryffindor table (which, inconve-"
4834,"niently, was the farthest from the entrance hall) without being"
4835,"noticed. As though he had read Harry’s mind, however, Snape said,"
4836,"“No cloak. You can walk in so that everyone sees you, which is"
4837,"what you wanted, I’m sure.”"
4838,Harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the
4839,"open doors: anything to get away from Snape. The Great Hall,"
4840,with its four long House tables and its staff table set at the top of
4841,"the room, was decorated as usual with floating candles that made"
4842,the plates below glitter and glow. It was all a shimmering blur to
4843,"Harry, however, who walked so fast that he was passing the Huf-"
4844,"flepuff table before people really started to stare, and by the time"
4845,"they were standing up to get a good look at him, he had spotted"
4846,"Ron and Hermione, sped along the benches toward them, and"
4847,forced his way in between them.
4848,"“Where’ve you — blimey, what’ve you done to your face?” said"
4849,"Ron, goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity."
4850,"“Why, what’s wrong with it?” said Harry, grabbing a spoon and"
4851,squinting at his distorted reflection.
4852,“You’re covered in blood!” said Hermione. “Come here —”
4853,"She raised her wand, said “Tergeo!” and siphoned off the dried"
4854,blood.
4855,"“Thanks,” said Harry, feeling his now clean face. “How’s my"
4856,nose looking?”
4857, 162   
4858,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4859,"“Normal,” said Hermione anxiously. “Why shouldn’t it? Harry,"
4860,what happened? We’ve been terrified!”
4861,"“I’ll tell you later,” said Harry curtly. He was very conscious that"
4862,"Ginny, Neville, Dean, and Seamus were listening in; even Nearly"
4863,"Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had come floating along the"
4864,bench to eavesdrop.
4865,“But —” said Hermione.
4866,"“Not now, Hermione,” said Harry, in a darkly significant voice."
4867,He hoped very much that they would all assume he had been in-
4868,"volved in something heroic, preferably involving a couple of Death"
4869,"Eaters and a dementor. Of course, Malfoy would spread the story as"
4870,"far and wide as he could, but there was always a chance it wouldn’t"
4871,reach too many Gryffindor ears.
4872,He reached across Ron for a couple of chicken legs and a hand-
4873,"ful of chips, but before he could take them they vanished, to be re-"
4874,placed with puddings.
4875,"“You missed the Sorting, anyway,” said Hermione, as Ron dived"
4876,for a large chocolate gateau.
4877,"“Hat say anything interesting?” asked Harry, taking a piece of"
4878,treacle tart.
4879,"“More of the same, really . . . advising us all to unite in the face"
4880,"of our enemies, you know.”"
4881,“Dumbledore mentioned Voldemort at all?”
4882,"“Not yet, but he always saves his proper speech for after the"
4883,"feast, doesn’t he? It can’t be long now.”"
4884,“Snape said Hagrid was late for the feast —”
4885,“You’ve seen Snape? How come?” said Ron between frenzied
4886,mouthfuls of gateau.
4887, 163  
4888,CHAPTER EIGHT
4889,"“Bumped into him,” said Harry evasively."
4890,"“Hagrid was only a few minutes late,” said Hermione. “Look,"
4891,"he’s waving at you, Harry.”"
4892,"Harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at Hagrid, who"
4893,was indeed waving at him. Hagrid had never quite managed to
4894,"comport himself with the dignity of Professor McGonagall, Head"
4895,"of Gryffindor House, the top of whose head came up to somewhere"
4896,between Hagrid’s elbow and shoulder as they were sitting side by
4897,"side, and who was looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greet-"
4898,"ing. Harry was surprised to see the Divination teacher, Professor"
4899,"Trelawney, sitting on Hagrid’s other side; she rarely left her tower"
4900,"room, and he had never seen her at the start-of-term feast before."
4901,"She looked as odd as ever, glittering with beads and trailing shawls,"
4902,her eyes magnified to enormous size by her spectacles. Having al-
4903,"ways considered her a bit of a fraud, Harry had been shocked to"
4904,discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who
4905,had made the prediction that caused Lord Voldemort to kill
4906,Harry’s parents and attack Harry himself. The knowledge had
4907,"made him even less eager to find himself in her company, but"
4908,"thankfully, this year he would be dropping Divination. Her great"
4909,beaconlike eyes swiveled in his direction; he hastily looked away to-
4910,ward the Slytherin table. Draco Malfoy was miming the shattering
4911,of a nose to raucous laughter and applause. Harry dropped his gaze
4912,"to his treacle tart, his insides burning again. What he would not"
4913,give to fight Malfoy one-on-one . . .
4914,“So what did Professor Slughorn want?” Hermione asked.
4915,"“To know what really happened at the Ministry,” said Harry."
4916,"“Him and everyone else here,” sniffed Hermione. “People were"
4917,"interrogating us about it on the train, weren’t they, Ron?”"
4918, 164  
4919,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4920,"“Yeah,” said Ron. “All wanting to know if you really are ‘the"
4921,Chosen One’ —”
4922,“There has been much talk on that very subject even amongst
4923,"the ghosts,” interrupted Nearly Headless Nick, inclining his barely"
4924,connected head toward Harry so that it wobbled dangerously on its
4925,ruff. “I am considered something of a Potter authority; it is widely
4926,known that we are friendly. I have assured the spirit community
4927,"that I will not pester you for information, however. ‘Harry Potter"
4928,"knows that he can confide in me with complete confidence,’ I told"
4929,them. ‘I would rather die than betray his trust.’ ”
4930,"“That’s not saying much, seeing as you’re already dead,” Ron"
4931,observed.
4932,"“Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe,” said"
4933,"Nearly Headless Nick in affronted tones, and he rose into the air"
4934,and glided back toward the far end of the Gryffindor table just as
4935,Dumbledore got to his feet at the staff table. The talk and laughter
4936,echoing around the Hall died away almost instantly.
4937,"“The very best of evenings to you!” he said, smiling broadly, his"
4938,arms opened wide as though to embrace the whole room.
4939,“What happened to his hand?” gasped Hermione.
4940,She was not the only one who had noticed. Dumbledore’s right
4941,hand was as blackened and dead-looking as it had been on the
4942,night he had come to fetch Harry from the Dursleys. Whispers
4943,"swept the room; Dumbledore, interpreting them correctly, merely"
4944,smiled and shook his purple-and-gold sleeve over his injury.
4945,"“Nothing to worry about,” he said airily. “Now . . . to our new"
4946,"students, welcome, to our old students, welcome back! Another"
4947,year full of magical education awaits you . . .”
4948,"“His hand was like that when I saw him over the summer,”"
4949, 165  
4950,CHAPTER EIGHT
4951,Harry whispered to Hermione. “I thought he’d have cured it by
4952,"now, though . . . or Madam Pomfrey would’ve done.”"
4953,"“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expres-"
4954,sion. “But there are some injuries you can’t cure . . . old curses . . .
4955,and there are poisons without antidotes. . . .”
4956,"“. . . and Mr. Filch, our caretaker, has asked me to say that there"
4957,is a blanket ban on any joke items bought at the shop called
4958,Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes.
4959,“Those wishing to play for their House Quidditch teams should
4960,give their names to their Heads of House as usual. We are also look-
4961,"ing for new Quidditch commentators, who should do likewise."
4962,“We are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year.
4963,"Professor Slughorn” — Slughorn stood up, his bald head gleaming"
4964,"in the candlelight, his big waistcoated belly casting the table below"
4965,into shadow — “is a former colleague of mine who has agreed to
4966,resume his old post of Potions master.”
4967,“Potions?”
4968,“Potions?”
4969,The word echoed all over the Hall as people wondered whether
4970,they had heard right.
4971,"“Potions?” said Ron and Hermione together, turning to stare at"
4972,Harry. “But you said —”
4973,"“Professor Snape, meanwhile,” said Dumbledore, raising his"
4974,"voice so that it carried over all the muttering, “will be taking over"
4975,the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.”
4976,"“No!” said Harry, so loudly that many heads turned in his direc-"
4977,"tion. He did not care; he was staring up at the staff table, incensed."
4978,How could Snape be given the Defense Against the Dark Arts job
4979, 166 
4980,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
4981,after all this time? Hadn’t it been widely known for years that
4982,Dumbledore did not trust him to do it?
4983,"“But Harry, you said that Slughorn was going to be teaching De-"
4984,fense Against the Dark Arts!” said Hermione.
4985,"“I thought he was!” said Harry, racking his brains to remember"
4986,"when Dumbledore had told him this, but now that he came to"
4987,"think of it, he was unable to recall Dumbledore ever telling him"
4988,what Slughorn would be teaching.
4989,"Snape, who was sitting on Dumbledore’s right, did not stand up"
4990,at the mention of his name; he merely raised a hand in lazy ac-
4991,"knowledgment of the applause from the Slytherin table, yet Harry"
4992,was sure he could detect a look of triumph on the features he
4993,loathed so much.
4994,"“Well, there’s one good thing,” he said savagely. “Snape’ll be"
4995,gone by the end of the year.”
4996,“What do you mean?” asked Ron.
4997,“That job’s jinxed. No one’s lasted more than a year. . . . Quirrell
4998,"actually died doing it. . . . Personally, I’m going to keep my fingers"
4999,crossed for another death. . . .”
5000,"“Harry!” said Hermione, shocked and reproachful."
5001,“He might just go back to teaching Potions at the end of the
5002,"year,” said Ron reasonably. “That Slughorn bloke might not want"
5003,to stay long-term. Moody didn’t.”
5004,"Dumbledore cleared his throat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were"
5005,not the only ones who had been talking; the whole Hall had erupted
5006,in a buzz of conversation at the news that Snape had finally achieved
5007,his heart’s desire. Seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of
5008,"the news he had just imparted, Dumbledore said nothing more"
5009, 167   
5010,CHAPTER EIGHT
5011,"about staff appointments, but waited a few seconds to ensure that"
5012,the silence was absolute before continuing.
5013,"“Now, as everybody in this Hall knows, Lord Voldemort and his"
5014,followers are once more at large and gaining in strength.”
5015,The silence seemed to tauten and strain as Dumbledore spoke.
5016,"Harry glanced at Malfoy. Malfoy was not looking at Dumbledore,"
5017,"but making his fork hover in midair with his wand, as though he"
5018,found the headmaster’s words unworthy of his attention.
5019,“I cannot emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present
5020,"situation is, and how much care each of us at Hogwarts must take"
5021,to ensure that we remain safe. The castle’s magical fortifications
5022,"have been strengthened over the summer, we are protected in new"
5023,"and more powerful ways, but we must still guard scrupulously"
5024,against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff.
5025,"I urge you, therefore, to abide by any security restrictions that your"
5026,"teachers might impose upon you, however irksome you might find"
5027,"them — in particular, the rule that you are not to be out of bed af-"
5028,"ter hours. I implore you, should you notice anything strange or"
5029,"suspicious within or outside the castle, to report it to a member of"
5030,"staff immediately. I trust you to conduct yourselves, always, with"
5031,the utmost regard for your own and others’ safety.”
5032,Dumbledore’s blue eyes swept over the students before he smiled
5033,once more.
5034,"“But now, your beds await, as warm and comfortable as you"
5035,"could possibly wish, and I know that your top priority is to be well-"
5036,rested for your lessons tomorrow. Let us therefore say good night.
5037,Pip pip!”
5038,"With the usual deafening scraping noise, the benches were"
5039,moved back and the hundreds of students began to file out of the
5040, 168  
5041,SNAPE VICTORIOUS
5042,"Great Hall toward their dormitories. Harry, who was in no hurry"
5043,"at all to leave with the gawping crowd, nor to get near enough to"
5044,"Malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nose-stamping, lagged"
5045,"behind, pretending to retie the lace on his trainer, allowing most of"
5046,the Gryffindors to draw ahead of him. Hermione had darted ahead
5047,"to fulfill her prefect’s duty of shepherding the first years, but Ron"
5048,remained with Harry.
5049,"“What really happened to your nose?” he asked, once they were"
5050,"at the very back of the throng pressing out of the Hall, and out of"
5051,earshot of anyone else.
5052,Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship
5053,that Ron did not laugh.
5054,"“I saw Malfoy miming something to do with a nose,” he said"
5055,darkly.
5056,"“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry bitterly. “Listen to"
5057,what he was saying before he found out I was there. . . .”
5058,Harry had expected Ron to be stunned by Malfoy’s boasts. With
5059,"what Harry considered pure pigheadedness, however, Ron was"
5060,unimpressed.
5061,"“Come on, Harry, he was just showing off for Parkinson. . . ."
5062,What kind of mission would You-Know-Who have given him?”
5063,“How d’you know Voldemort doesn’t need someone at Hog-
5064,warts? It wouldn’t be the first —”
5065,"“I wish yeh’d stop sayin’ tha’ name, Harry,” said a reproachful"
5066,voice behind them. Harry looked over his shoulder to see Hagrid
5067,shaking his head.
5068,"“Dumbledore uses that name,” said Harry stubbornly."
5069,"“Yeah, well, tha’s Dumbledore, innit?” said Hagrid mysteriously."
5070,"“So how come yeh were late, Harry? I was worried.”"
5071,  169 
5072,CHAPTER EIGHT
5073,"“Got held up on the train,” said Harry. “Why were you late?”"
5074,"“I was with Grawp,” said Hagrid happily. “Los’ track o’ the time."
5075,"He’s got a new home up in the mountains now, Dumbledore fixed"
5076,it — nice big cave. He’s much happier than he was in the forest.
5077,We were havin’ a good chat.”
5078,"“Really?” said Harry, taking care not to catch Ron’s eye; the last"
5079,"time he had met Hagrid’s half-brother, a vicious giant with a talent"
5080,"for ripping up trees by the roots, his vocabulary had comprised five"
5081,"words, two of which he was unable to pronounce properly."
5082,"“Oh yeah, he’s really come on,” said Hagrid proudly. “Yeh’ll be"
5083,amazed. I’m thinkin’ o’ trainin’ him up as me assistant.”
5084,"Ron snorted loudly, but managed to pass it off as a violent"
5085,sneeze. They were now standing beside the oak front doors.
5086,"“Anyway, I’ll see yeh tomorrow, firs’ lesson’s straight after lunch."
5087,"Come early an’ yeh can say hello ter Buck — I mean, Witherwings!”"
5088,"Raising an arm in cheery farewell, he headed out of the front"
5089,doors into the darkness.
5090,Harry and Ron looked at each other. Harry could tell that Ron
5091,was experiencing the same sinking feeling as himself.
5092,"“You’re not taking Care of Magical Creatures, are you?”"
5093,"Ron shook his head. “And you’re not either, are you?”"
5094,Harry shook his head too.
5095,"“And Hermione,” said Ron, “she’s not, is she?”"
5096,Harry shook his head again. Exactly what Hagrid would say
5097,when he realized his three favorite students had given up his sub-
5098,"ject, he did not like to think."

5101,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5102,H           arry and Ron met Hermione in the common room be-
5103,fore breakfast next morning. Hoping for some support for
5104,"his theory, Harry lost no time in telling Hermione what he had"
5105,overheard Malfoy saying on the Hogwarts Express.
5106,"“But he was obviously showing off for Parkinson, wasn’t he?” in-"
5107,"terjected Ron quickly, before Hermione could say anything."
5108,"“Well,” she said uncertainly, “I don’t know. . . . It would be like"
5109,Malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is . . . but
5110,that’s a big lie to tell. . . .”
5111,"“Exactly,” said Harry, but he could not press the point, because"
5112,"so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to"
5113,mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.
5114,"“It’s rude to point,” Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule"
5115,first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait
5116,"hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry"
5117, 171 
5118,CHAPTER NINE
5119,"behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled"
5120,out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered.
5121,“I love being a sixth year. And we’re going to be getting free time
5122,this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax.”
5123,"“We’re going to need that time for studying, Ron!” said Hermi-"
5124,"one, as they set off down the corridor."
5125,"“Yeah, but not today,” said Ron. “Today’s going to be a real doss,"
5126,I reckon.”
5127,"“Hold it!” said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a"
5128,"passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a"
5129,lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. “Fanged Frisbees are
5130,"banned, hand it over,” she told him sternly. The scowling boy"
5131,"handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took"
5132,"off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the"
5133,Frisbee from Hermione’s grip.
5134,"“Excellent, I’ve always wanted one of these.”"
5135,Hermione’s remonstration was drowned by a loud giggle; Laven-
5136,der Brown had apparently found Ron’s remark highly amusing. She
5137,"continued to laugh as she passed them, glancing back at Ron over"
5138,her shoulder. Ron looked rather pleased with himself.
5139,The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked
5140,"with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through"
5141,the high mullioned windows. While they tucked into porridge and
5142,"eggs and bacon, Harry and Ron told Hermione about their embar-"
5143,rassing conversation with Hagrid the previous evening.
5144,“But he can’t really think we’d continue Care of Magical Crea-
5145,"tures!” she said, looking distressed. “I mean, when has any of us ex-"
5146,pressed . . . you know . . . any enthusiasm?”
5147,"“That’s it, though, innit?” said Ron, swallowing an entire fried"

5149,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5150,egg whole. “We were the ones who made the most effort in classes
5151,because we like Hagrid. But he thinks we liked the stupid subject.
5152,D’you reckon anyone’s going to go on to N.E.W.T.?”
5153,Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need.
5154,They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to
5155,continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid’s eye
5156,and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the
5157,staff table ten minutes later.
5158,"After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting"
5159,Professor McGonagall’s descent from the staff table. The distribu-
5160,"tion of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year,"
5161,for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody
5162,had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their
5163,chosen N.E.W.T.s.
5164,"Hermione was immediately cleared to continue with Charms,"
5165,"Defense Against the Dark Arts, Transfiguration, Herbology,"
5166,"Arithmancy, Ancient Runes, and Potions, and shot off to a first-"
5167,period Ancient Runes class without further ado. Neville took a lit-
5168,tle longer to sort out; his round face was anxious as Professor
5169,McGonagall looked down his application and then consulted his
5170,O.W.L. results.
5171,"“Herbology, fine,” she said. “Professor Sprout will be delighted"
5172,to see you back with an ‘Outstanding’ O.W.L. And you qualify for
5173,Defense Against the Dark Arts with ‘Exceeds Expectations.’ But the
5174,"problem is Transfiguration. I’m sorry, Longbottom, but an"
5175,Acceptable’ really isn’t good enough to continue to N.E.W.T level.
5176,I just don’t think you’d be able to cope with the coursework.”
5177,Neville hung his head. Professor McGonagall peered at him
5178,through her square spectacles.
5179, 173  
5180,CHAPTER NINE
5181,"“Why do you want to continue with Transfiguration, anyway?"
5182,I’ve never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it.”
5183,Neville looked miserable and muttered something about “my
5184,grandmother wants.”
5185,"“Hmph,” snorted Professor McGonagall. “It’s high time your"
5186,"grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she’s got, rather"
5187,than the one she thinks she ought to have — particularly after
5188,what happened at the Ministry.”
5189,Neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly; Professor
5190,McGonagall had never paid him a compliment before.
5191,"“I’m sorry, Longbottom, but I cannot let you into my N.E.W.T."
5192,"class. I see that you have an ‘Exceeds Expectations’ in Charms,"
5193,however — why not try for a N.E.W.T. in Charms?”
5194,"“My grandmother thinks Charms is a soft option,” mumbled"
5195,Neville.
5196,"“Take Charms,” said Professor McGonagall, “and I shall drop"
5197,Augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her
5198,"Charms O.W.L., the subject is not necessarily worthless.” Smiling"
5199,"slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on Neville’s face, Profes-"
5200,sor McGonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of her wand
5201,"and handed it, now carrying details of his new classes, to Neville."
5202,"Professor McGonagall turned next to Parvati Patil, whose first"
5203,"question was whether Firenze, the handsome centaur, was still"
5204,teaching Divination.
5205,“He and Professor Trelawney are dividing classes between them
5206,"this year,” said Professor McGonagall, a hint of disapproval in her"
5207,voice; it was common knowledge that she despised the subject of
5208,Divination. “The sixth year is being taken by Professor Trelawney.”
5209, 174  
5210,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5211,Parvati set off for Divination five minutes later looking slightly
5212,crestfallen.
5213,"“So, Potter, Potter . . .” said Professor McGonagall, consulting"
5214,"her notes as she turned to Harry. “Charms, Defense Against the"
5215,"Dark Arts, Herbology, Transfiguration . . . all fine. I must say, I was"
5216,"pleased with your Transfiguration mark, Potter, very pleased. Now,"
5217,why haven’t you applied to continue with Potions? I thought it was
5218,your ambition to become an Auror?”
5219,"“It was, but you told me I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my"
5220,"O.W.L., Professor.”"
5221,“And so you did when Professor Snape was teaching the subject.
5222,"Professor Slughorn, however, is perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T"
5223,students with ‘Exceeds Expectations’ at O.W.L. Do you wish to
5224,proceed with Potions?”
5225,"“Yes,” said Harry, “but I didn’t buy the books or any ingredients"
5226,or anything —”
5227,"“I’m sure Professor Slughorn will be able to lend you some,” said"
5228,"Professor McGonagall. “Very well, Potter, here is your schedule."
5229,"Oh, by the way — twenty hopefuls have already put down their"
5230,names for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. I shall pass the list to
5231,you in due course and you can fix up trials at your leisure.”
5232,"A few minutes later, Ron was cleared to do the same subjects as"
5233,"Harry, and the two of them left the table together."
5234,"“Look,” said Ron delightedly, gazing at his schedule, “we’ve got"
5235,a free period now . . . and a free period after break . . . and after
5236,lunch . . . excellent!”
5237,"They returned to the common room, which was empty apart"
5238,"from a half dozen seventh years, including Katie Bell, the only"
5239, 175  
5240,CHAPTER NINE
5241,remaining member of the original Gryffindor Quidditch team that
5242,Harry had joined in his first year.
5243,"“I thought you’d get that, well done,” she called over, pointing"
5244,at the Captain’s badge on Harry’s chest. “Tell me when you call
5245,trials!”
5246,"“Don’t be stupid,” said Harry, “you don’t need to try out, I’ve"
5247,watched you play for five years. . . .”
5248,"“You mustn’t start off like that,” she said warningly. “For all you"
5249,"know, there’s someone much better than me out there. Good teams"
5250,have been ruined before now because Captains just kept playing
5251,"the old faces, or letting in their friends. . . .”"
5252,Ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the
5253,Fanged Frisbee Hermione had taken from the fourth-year student.
5254,"It zoomed around the common room, snarling and attempting to"
5255,take bites of the tapestry. Crookshanks’s yellow eyes followed it and
5256,he hissed when it came too close.
5257,An hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for
5258,the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom four floors below.
5259,"Hermione was already queuing outside, carrying an armful of"
5260,heavy books and looking put-upon.
5261,"“We got so much homework for Runes,” she said anxiously,"
5262,"when Harry and Ron joined her. “A fifteen-inch essay, two transla-"
5263,"tions, and I’ve got to read these by Wednesday!”"
5264,"“Shame,” yawned Ron."
5265,"“You wait,” she said resentfully. “I bet Snape gives us loads.”"
5266,"The classroom door opened as she spoke, and Snape stepped"
5267,"into the corridor, his sallow face framed as ever by two curtains of"
5268,greasy black hair. Silence fell over the queue immediately.
5269,"“Inside,” he said."
5270, 176   
5271,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5272,Harry looked around as they entered. Snape had imposed his
5273,"personality upon the room already; it was gloomier than usual, as"
5274,"curtains had been drawn over the windows, and was lit by candle-"
5275,"light. New pictures adorned the walls, many of them showing peo-"
5276,"ple who appeared to be in pain, sporting grisly injuries or strangely"
5277,"contorted body parts. Nobody spoke as they settled down, looking"
5278,"around at the shadowy, gruesome pictures."
5279,"“I have not asked you to take out your books,” said Snape, clos-"
5280,ing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk;
5281,Hermione hastily dropped her copy of Confronting the Faceless back
5282,"into her bag and stowed it under her chair. “I wish to speak to you,"
5283,and I want your fullest attention.”
5284,"His black eyes roved over their upturned faces, lingering for a"
5285,fraction of a second longer on Harry’s than anyone else’s.
5286,"“You have had five teachers in this subject so far, I believe.”"
5287,"You believe . . . like you haven’t watched them all come and go,"
5288,"Snape, hoping you’d be next, thought Harry scathingly."
5289,"“Naturally, these teachers will all have had their own methods"
5290,and priorities. Given this confusion I am surprised so many of you
5291,scraped an O.W.L. in this subject. I shall be even more surprised if
5292,"all of you manage to keep up with the N.E.W.T. work, which will"
5293,be much more advanced.”
5294,"Snape set off around the edge of the room, speaking now in a"
5295,lower voice; the class craned their necks to keep him in view.
5296,"“The Dark Arts,” said Snape, “are many, varied, ever-changing,"
5297,"and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster,"
5298,"which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and"
5299,"cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutat-"
5300,"ing, indestructible.”"
5301, 177   
5302,CHAPTER NINE
5303,Harry stared at Snape. It was surely one thing to respect the
5304,"Dark Arts as a dangerous enemy, another to speak of them, as"
5305,"Snape was doing, with a loving caress in his voice?"
5306,"“Your defenses,” said Snape, a little louder, “must therefore be as"
5307,flexible and inventive as the arts you seek to undo. These pictures”
5308,— he indicated a few of them as he swept past — “give a fair rep-
5309,"resentation of what happens to those who suffer, for instance, the"
5310,Cruciatus Curse” — he waved a hand toward a witch who was
5311,clearly shrieking in agony — “feel the Dementor’s Kiss” — a wiz-
5312,"ard lying huddled and blank-eyed, slumped against a wall — “or"
5313,provoke the aggression of the Inferius” — a bloody mass upon the
5314,ground.
5315,"“Has an Inferius been seen, then?” said Parvati Patil in a high-"
5316,"pitched voice. “Is it definite, is he using them?”"
5317,"“The Dark Lord has used Inferi in the past,” said Snape, “which"
5318,means you would be well-advised to assume he might use them
5319,again. Now . . .”
5320,He set off again around the other side of the classroom toward
5321,"his desk, and again, they watched him as he walked, his dark robes"
5322,billowing behind him.
5323,"“. . . you are, I believe, complete novices in the use of nonverbal"
5324,spells. What is the advantage of a nonverbal spell?”
5325,Hermione’s hand shot into the air. Snape took his time looking
5326,"around at everybody else, making sure he had no choice, before"
5327,"saying curtly, “Very well — Miss Granger?”"
5328,“Your adversary has no warning about what kind of magic you’re
5329,"about to perform,” said Hermione, “which gives you a split-second"
5330,advantage.”
5331,“An answer copied almost word for word from The Standard Book
5332,  178  
5333,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5334,"of Spells, Grade Six,” said Snape dismissively (over in the corner,"
5335,"Malfoy sniggered), “but correct in essentials. Yes, those who progress"
5336,to using magic without shouting incantations gain an element of
5337,"surprise in their spell-casting. Not all wizards can do this, of course;"
5338,it is a question of concentration and mind power which some” —
5339,his gaze lingered maliciously upon Harry once more — “lack.”
5340,Harry knew Snape was thinking of their disastrous Occlumency
5341,"lessons of the previous year. He refused to drop his gaze, but glow-"
5342,ered at Snape until Snape looked away.
5343,"“You will now divide,” Snape went on, “into pairs. One partner"
5344,will attempt to jinx the other without speaking. The other will at-
5345,tempt to repel the jinx in equal silence. Carry on.”
5346,"Although Snape did not know it, Harry had taught at least half"
5347,the class (everyone who had been a member of the D.A.) how to
5348,perform a Shield Charm the previous year. None of them had ever
5349,"cast the charm without speaking, however. A reasonable amount of"
5350,cheating ensued; many people were merely whispering the
5351,"incantation instead of saying it aloud. Typically, ten minutes into"
5352,the lesson Hermione managed to repel Neville’s muttered Jelly-
5353,"Legs Jinx without uttering a single word, a feat that would surely"
5354,have earned her twenty points for Gryffindor from any reasonable
5355,"teacher, thought Harry bitterly, but which Snape ignored. He"
5356,"swept between them as they practiced, looking just as much like"
5357,"an overgrown bat as ever, lingering to watch Harry and Ron strug-"
5358,gling with the task.
5359,"Ron, who was supposed to be jinxing Harry, was purple in the"
5360,"face, his lips tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation"
5361,"of muttering the incantation. Harry had his wand raised, waiting"
5362,on tenterhooks to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come.
5363, 179   
5364,CHAPTER NINE
5365,"“Pathetic, Weasley,” said Snape, after a while. “Here — let me"
5366,show you —”
5367,He turned his wand on Harry so fast that Harry reacted instinc-
5368,"tively; all thought of nonverbal spells forgotten, he yelled, “Protego!”"
5369,His Shield Charm was so strong Snape was knocked off-balance
5370,and hit a desk. The whole class had looked around and now
5371,"watched as Snape righted himself, scowling."
5372,“Do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal
5373,"spells, Potter?”"
5374,"“Yes,” said Harry stiffly."
5375,"“Yes, sir.”"
5376,"“There’s no need to call me ‘sir,’ Professor.”"
5377,The words had escaped him before he knew what he was saying.
5378,"Several people gasped, including Hermione. Behind Snape, how-"
5379,"ever, Ron, Dean, and Seamus grinned appreciatively."
5380,"“Detention, Saturday night, my office,” said Snape. “I do not"
5381,"take cheek from anyone, Potter . . . not even ‘the Chosen One.’ ”"
5382,"“That was brilliant, Harry!” chortled Ron, once they were safely"
5383,on their way to break a short while later.
5384,"“You really shouldn’t have said it,” said Hermione, frowning at"
5385,Ron. “What made you?”
5386,"“He tried to jinx me, in case you didn’t notice!” fumed Harry. “I"
5387,had enough of that during those Occlumency lessons! Why doesn’t
5388,he use another guinea pig for a change? What’s Dumbledore playing
5389,"at, anyway, letting him teach Defense? Did you hear him talking"
5390,"about the Dark Arts? He loves them! All that unfixed, indestructible"
5391,stuff —”
5392,"“Well,” said Hermione, “I thought he sounded a bit like you.”"
5393,“Like me?”
5394,  180   
5395,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5396,"“Yes, when you were telling us what it’s like to face Voldemort."
5397,"You said it wasn’t just memorizing a bunch of spells, you said it was"
5398,"just you and your brains and your guts — well, wasn’t that what"
5399,Snape was saying? That it really comes down to being brave and
5400,quick-thinking?”
5401,Harry was so disarmed that she had thought his words as well
5402,worth memorizing as The Standard Book of Spells that he did not
5403,argue.
5404,"“Harry! Hey, Harry!”"
5405,"Harry looked around; Jack Sloper, one of the Beaters on last"
5406,"year’s Gryffindor Quidditch team, was hurrying toward him hold-"
5407,ing a roll of parchment.
5408,"“For you,” panted Sloper. “Listen, I heard you’re the new Cap-"
5409,tain. When’re you holding trials?”
5410,"“I’m not sure yet,” said Harry, thinking privately that Sloper"
5411,would be very lucky to get back on the team. “I’ll let you know.”
5412,"“Oh, right. I was hoping it’d be this weekend —”"
5413,"But Harry was not listening; he had just recognized the thin,"
5414,"slanting writing on the parchment. Leaving Sloper in mid-sentence,"
5415,"he hurried away with Ron and Hermione, unrolling the parchment"
5416,as he went.
5417,"Dear Harry,"
5418,I would like to start our private lessons this Saturday.
5419,Kindly come along to my office at 8 P.M. I hope you are enjoy-
5420,ing your first day back at school.
5421,"Yours sincerely,"
5422,Albus Dumbledore
5423,P.S. I enjoy Acid Pops.
5424,  181  
5425,CHAPTER NINE
5426,"“He enjoys Acid Pops?” said Ron, who had read the message over"
5427,Harry’s shoulder and was looking perplexed.
5428,"“It’s the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study,” said"
5429,Harry in a low voice. “Ha! Snape’s not going to be pleased. . . . I
5430,won’t be able to do his detention!”
5431,"He, Ron, and Hermione spent the whole of break speculating"
5432,on what Dumbledore would teach Harry. Ron thought it most
5433,likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death
5434,"Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal,"
5435,and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach
5436,"Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to"
5437,"Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room,"
5438,where they grudgingly started Snape’s homework. This turned out
5439,to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione
5440,joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she consider-
5441,ably speeded up the process). They had only just finished when the
5442,bell rang for the afternoon’s double Potions and they beat the fa-
5443,"miliar path down to the dungeon classroom that had, for so long,"
5444,been Snape’s.
5445,When they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only
5446,a dozen people progressing to N.E.W.T. level. Crabbe and Goyle
5447,"had evidently failed to achieve the required O.W.L. grade, but four"
5448,"Slytherins had made it through, including Malfoy. Four Raven-"
5449,"claws were there, and one Hufflepuff, Ernie Macmillan, whom"
5450,Harry liked despite his rather pompous manner.
5451,"“Harry,” Ernie said portentously, holding out his hand as Harry"
5452,"approached, “didn’t get a chance to speak in Defense Against the"
5453,"Dark Arts this morning. Good lesson, I thought, but Shield"
5454, 182   
5455,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5456,"Charms are old hat, of course, for us old D.A. lags . . . And how are"
5457,"you, Ron — Hermione?”"
5458,"Before they could say more than “fine,” the dungeon door"
5459,opened and Slughorn’s belly preceded him out of the door. As they
5460,"filed into the room, his great walrus mustache curved above his"
5461,"beaming mouth, and he greeted Harry and Zabini with particular"
5462,enthusiasm.
5463,"The dungeon was, most unusually, already full of vapors and"
5464,"odd smells. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sniffed interestedly as they"
5465,"passed large, bubbling cauldrons. The four Slytherins took a table"
5466,"together, as did the four Ravenclaws. This left Harry, Ron, and"
5467,Hermione to share a table with Ernie. They chose the one nearest a
5468,gold-colored cauldron that was emitting one of the most seductive
5469,scents Harry had ever inhaled: Somehow it reminded him simulta-
5470,"neously of treacle tart, the woody smell of a broomstick handle,"
5471,and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the
5472,Burrow. He found that he was breathing very slowly and deeply
5473,and that the potion’s fumes seemed to be filling him up like drink.
5474,"A great contentment stole over him; he grinned across at Ron, who"
5475,grinned back lazily.
5476,"“Now then, now then, now then,” said Slughorn, whose massive"
5477,outline was quivering through the many shimmering vapors.
5478,"“Scales out, everyone, and potion kits, and don’t forget your copies"
5479,of Advanced Potion-Making. . . .”
5480,"“Sir?” said Harry, raising his hand."
5481,"“Harry, m’boy?”"
5482,“I haven’t got a book or scales or anything — nor’s Ron — we
5483,"didn’t realize we’d be able to do the N.E.W.T., you see —”"
5484, 183  
5485,CHAPTER NINE
5486,"“Ah, yes, Professor McGonagall did mention . . . not to worry,"
5487,"my dear boy, not to worry at all. You can use ingredients from the"
5488,"store cupboard today, and I’m sure we can lend you some scales,"
5489,"and we’ve got a small stock of old books here, they’ll do until you"
5490,can write to Flourish and Blotts. . . .”
5491,"Slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and, after a moment’s"
5492,"foraging, emerged with two very battered-looking copies of Ad-"
5493,"vanced Potion-Making by Libatius Borage, which he gave to Harry"
5494,and Ron along with two sets of tarnished scales.
5495,"“Now then,” said Slughorn, returning to the front of the class"
5496,and inflating his already bulging chest so that the buttons on his
5497,"waistcoat threatened to burst off, “I’ve prepared a few potions for"
5498,"you to have a look at, just out of interest, you know. These are the"
5499,kind of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your
5500,"N.E.W.T.s. You ought to have heard of ’em, even if you haven’t"
5501,made ’em yet. Anyone tell me what this one is?”
5502,He indicated the cauldron nearest the Slytherin table. Harry
5503,raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain
5504,water boiling away inside it.
5505,Hermione’s well-practiced hand hit the air before anybody else’s;
5506,Slughorn pointed at her.
5507,"“It’s Veritaserum, a colorless, odorless potion that forces the"
5508,"drinker to tell the truth,” said Hermione."
5509,"“Very good, very good!” said Slughorn happily. “Now,” he con-"
5510,"tinued, pointing at the cauldron nearest the Ravenclaw table, “this"
5511,one here is pretty well known. . . . Featured in a few Ministry
5512,leaflets lately too . . . Who can — ?”
5513,Hermione’s hand was fastest once more.
5514, 184  
5515,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5516,"“It’s Polyjuice Potion, sir,” she said."
5517,"Harry too had recognized the slow-bubbling, mudlike substance"
5518,"in the second cauldron, but did not resent Hermione getting the"
5519,"credit for answering the question; she, after all, was the one who"
5520,"had succeeded in making it, back in their second year."
5521,"“Excellent, excellent! Now, this one here . . . yes, my dear?” said"
5522,"Slughorn, now looking slightly bemused, as Hermione’s hand"
5523,punched the air again.
5524,“It’s Amortentia!”
5525,"“It is indeed. It seems almost foolish to ask,” said Slughorn, who"
5526,"was looking mightily impressed, “but I assume you know what it"
5527,does?”
5528,“It’s the most powerful love potion in the world!” said Hermione.
5529,"“Quite right! You recognized it, I suppose, by its distinctive"
5530,mother-of-pearl sheen?”
5531,"“And the steam rising in characteristic spirals,” said Hermione"
5532,"enthusiastically, “and it’s supposed to smell differently to each of"
5533,"us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown"
5534,grass and new parchment and —”
5535,But she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence.
5536,"“May I ask your name, my dear?” said Slughorn, ignoring Her-"
5537,mione’s embarrassment.
5538,"“Hermione Granger, sir.”"
5539,“Granger? Granger? Can you possibly be related to Hector
5540,"Dagworth-Granger, who founded the Most Extraordinary Society"
5541,of Potioneers?”
5542,"“No, I don’t think so, sir. I’m Muggle-born, you see.”"
5543,Harry saw Malfoy lean close to Nott and whisper something;
5544, 185   
5545,CHAPTER NINE
5546,"both of them sniggered, but Slughorn showed no dismay; on the"
5547,"contrary, he beamed and looked from Hermione to Harry, who was"
5548,sitting next to her.
5549,"“Oho! ‘One of my best friends is Muggle-born, and she’s the best in"
5550,"our year!’ I’m assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke,"
5551,Harry?”
5552,"“Yes, sir,” said Harry."
5553,"“Well, well, take twenty well-earned points for Gryffindor, Miss"
5554,"Granger,” said Slughorn genially."
5555,Malfoy looked rather as he had done the time Hermione had
5556,punched him in the face. Hermione turned to Harry with a radiant
5557,"expression and whispered, “Did you really tell him I’m the best in"
5558,"the year? Oh, Harry!”"
5559,"“Well, what’s so impressive about that?” whispered Ron, who for"
5560,some reason looked annoyed. “You are the best in the year — I’d’ve
5561,told him so if he’d asked me!”
5562,"Hermione smiled but made a “shhing” gesture, so that they could"
5563,hear what Slughorn was saying. Ron looked slightly disgruntled.
5564,"“Amortentia doesn’t really create love, of course. It is impossible"
5565,"to manufacture or imitate love. No, this will simply cause a power-"
5566,ful infatuation or obsession. It is probably the most dangerous and
5567,"powerful potion in this room — oh yes,” he said, nodding gravely"
5568,"at Malfoy and Nott, both of whom were smirking skeptically."
5569,"“When you have seen as much of life as I have, you will not un-"
5570,derestimate the power of obsessive love. . . .
5571,"“And now,” said Slughorn, “it is time for us to start work.”"
5572,"“Sir, you haven’t told us what’s in this one,” said Ernie Macmil-"
5573,"lan, pointing at a small black cauldron standing on Slughorn’s"
5574,desk. The potion within was splashing about merrily; it was the
5575, 186   
5576,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5577,"color of molten gold, and large drops were leaping like goldfish"
5578,"above the surface, though not a particle had spilled."
5579,"“Oho,” said Slughorn again. Harry was sure that Slughorn had"
5580,"not forgotten the potion at all, but had waited to be asked for dra-"
5581,"matic effect. “Yes. That. Well, that one, ladies and gentlemen, is a"
5582,"most curious little potion called Felix Felicis. I take it,” he turned,"
5583,"smiling, to look at Hermione, who had let out an audible gasp,"
5584,"“that you know what Felix Felicis does, Miss Granger?”"
5585,"“It’s liquid luck,” said Hermione excitedly. “It makes you lucky!”"
5586,The whole class seemed to sit up a little straighten Now all
5587,"Harry could see of Malfoy was the back of his sleek blond head,"
5588,because he was at last giving Slughorn his full and undivided
5589,attention.
5590,"“Quite right, take another ten points for Gryffindor. Yes, it’s a"
5591,"funny little potion, Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn. “Desperately"
5592,"tricky to make, and disastrous to get wrong. However, if brewed"
5593,"correctly, as this has been, you will find that all your endeavors tend"
5594,to succeed . . . at least until the effects wear off.”
5595,"“Why don’t people drink it all the time, sir?” said Terry Boot"
5596,eagerly.
5597,"“Because if taken in excess, it causes giddiness, recklessness, and"
5598,"dangerous overconfidence,” said Slughorn. “Too much of a good"
5599,"thing, you know . . . highly toxic in large quantities. But taken"
5600,"sparingly, and very occasionally . . .”"
5601,"“Have you ever taken it, sir?” asked Michael Corner with great"
5602,interest.
5603,"“Twice in my life,” said Slughorn. “Once when I was twenty-"
5604,"four, once when I was fifty-seven. Two tablespoonfuls taken with"
5605,breakfast. Two perfect days.”
5606, 187   
5607,CHAPTER NINE
5608,He gazed dreamily into the distance. Whether he was playacting
5609,"or not, thought Harry, the effect was good."
5610,"“And that,” said Slughorn, apparently coming back to earth, “is"
5611,what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson.”
5612,There was silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the sur-
5613,rounding potions seemed magnified tenfold.
5614,"“One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis,” said Slughorn, taking a mi-"
5615,nuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing
5616,"it to them all. “Enough for twelve hours’ luck. From dawn till dusk,"
5617,you will be lucky in everything you attempt.
5618,"“Now, I must give you warning that Felix Felicis is a banned sub-"
5619,"stance in organized competitions . . . sporting events, for instance,"
5620,"examinations, or elections. So the winner is to use it on an ordinary"
5621,day only . . . and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraor-
5622,dinary!
5623,"“So,” said Slughorn, suddenly brisk, “how are you to win my"
5624,"fabulous prize? Well, by turning to page ten of Advanced Potion-"
5625,"Making. We have a little over an hour left to us, which should be"
5626,time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living
5627,Death. I know it is more complex than anything you have at-
5628,"tempted before, and I do not expect a perfect potion from any-"
5629,"body. The person who does best, however, will win little Felix here."
5630,Off you go!”
5631,There was a scraping as everyone drew their cauldrons toward
5632,them and some loud clunks as people began adding weights to
5633,"their scales, but nobody spoke. The concentration within the room"
5634,was almost tangible. Harry saw Malfoy riffling feverishly through
5635,his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. It could not have been clearer
5636, 188   
5637,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5638,that Malfoy really wanted that lucky day. Harry bent swiftly over
5639,the tattered book Slughorn had lent him.
5640,To his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled
5641,"all over the pages, so that the margins were as black as the printed"
5642,"portions. Bending low to decipher the ingredients (even here, the"
5643,previous owner had made annotations and crossed things out)
5644,Harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he
5645,"needed. As he dashed back to his cauldron, he saw Malfoy cutting"
5646,up valerian roots as fast as he could.
5647,Everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class was
5648,"doing; this was both an advantage and a disadvantage of Potions,"
5649,"that it was hard to keep your work private. Within ten minutes, the"
5650,"whole place was full of bluish steam. Hermione, of course, seemed"
5651,to have progressed furthest. Her potion already resembled the
5652,"“smooth, black currant-colored liquid” mentioned as the ideal"
5653,halfway stage.
5654,"Having finished chopping his roots, Harry bent low over his"
5655,"book again. It was really very irritating, having to try and decipher"
5656,"the directions under all the stupid scribbles of the previous owner,"
5657,who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the
5658,sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction:
5659,"Crush with flat side of silver dagger,"
5660,releases juice better than cutting.
5661,"“Sir, I think you knew my grandfather, Abraxas Malfoy?”"
5662,Harry looked up; Slughorn was just passing the Slytherin table.
5663,"“Yes,” said Slughorn, without looking at Malfoy, “I was sorry to"
5664, 189  
5665,CHAPTER NINE
5666,"hear he had died, although of course it wasn’t unexpected, dragon"
5667,pox at his age. . . .”
5668,"And he walked away. Harry bent back over his cauldron, smirk-"
5669,ing. He could tell that Malfoy had expected to be treated like Harry
5670,or Zabini; perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of
5671,the type he had learned to expect from Snape. It looked as though
5672,Malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle
5673,of Felix Felicis.
5674,The sopophorous bean was proving very difficult to cut up.
5675,Harry turned to Hermione.
5676,“Can I borrow your silver knife?”
5677,"She nodded impatiently, not taking her eyes off her potion,"
5678,"which was still deep purple, though according to the book ought to"
5679,be turning a light shade of lilac by now.
5680,Harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger. To his as-
5681,"tonishment, it immediately exuded so much juice he was amazed"
5682,the shriveled bean could have held it all. Hastily scooping it all into
5683,"the cauldron he saw, to his surprise, that the potion immediately"
5684,turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook.
5685,"His annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot,"
5686,Harry now squinted at the next line of instructions. According to
5687,"the book, he had to stir counterclockwise until the potion turned"
5688,clear as water. According to the addition the previous owner had
5689,"made, however, he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh"
5690,counterclockwise stir. Could the old owner be right twice?
5691,"Harry stirred counterclockwise, held his breath, and stirred once"
5692,clockwise. The effect was immediate. The potion turned palest
5693,pink.
5694,"“How are you doing that?” demanded Hermione, who was red-"
5695, 190  
5696,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5697,faced and whose hair was growing bushier and bushier in the fumes
5698,from her cauldron; her potion was still resolutely purple.
5699,“Add a clockwise stir —”
5700,"“No, no, the book says counterclockwise!” she snapped."
5701,Harry shrugged and continued what he was doing. Seven stirs
5702,"counterclockwise, one clockwise, pause . . . seven stirs counter-"
5703,"clockwise, one stir clockwise . . ."
5704,"Across the table, Ron was cursing fluently under his breath; his"
5705,potion looked like liquid licorice. Harry glanced around. As far as
5706,"he could see, no one else’s potion had turned as pale as his. He felt"
5707,"elated, something that had certainly never happened before in this"
5708,dungeon.
5709,"“And time’s . . . up!” called Slughorn. “Stop stirring, please!”"
5710,"Slughorn moved slowly among the tables, peering into caul-"
5711,"drons. He made no comment, but occasionally gave the potions a"
5712,"stir or a sniff. At last he reached the table where Harry, Ron, Her-"
5713,"mione, and Ernie were sitting. He smiled ruefully at the tarlike"
5714,substance in Ron’s cauldron. He passed over Ernie’s navy concoc-
5715,tion. Hermione’s potion he gave an approving nod. Then he saw
5716,"Harry’s, and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face."
5717,"“The clear winner!” he cried to the dungeon. “Excellent, excel-"
5718,"lent, Harry! Good lord, it’s clear you’ve inherited your mother’s tal-"
5719,"ent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then,"
5720,"here you are — one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it"
5721,well!”
5722,Harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner
5723,"pocket, feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious looks"
5724,on the Slytherins’ faces and guilt at the disappointed expression on
5725,Hermione’s. Ron looked simply dumbfounded.
5726, 191  
5727,CHAPTER NINE
5728,“How did you do that?” he whispered to Harry as they left the
5729,dungeon.
5730,"“Got lucky, I suppose,” said Harry, because Malfoy was within"
5731,earshot.
5732,Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for
5733,"dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione’s face"
5734,became stonier with every word he uttered.
5735,"“I s’pose you think I cheated?” he finished, aggravated by her"
5736,expression.
5737,"“Well, it wasn’t exactly your own work, was it?” she said stiffly."
5738,"“He only followed different instructions to ours,” said Ron."
5739,"“Could’ve been a catastrophe, couldn’t it? But he took a risk and it"
5740,paid off.” He heaved a sigh. “Slughorn could’ve handed me that
5741,"book, but no, I get the one no one’s ever written on. Puked on, by"
5742,"the look of page fifty-two, but —”"
5743,"“Hang on,” said a voice close by Harry’s left ear and he caught a"
5744,sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn’s
5745,dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them.
5746,“Did I hear right? You’ve been taking orders from something some-
5747,"one wrote in a book, Harry?”"
5748,She looked alarmed and angry. Harry knew what was on her
5749,mind at once.
5750,"“It’s nothing,” he said reassuringly, lowering his voice. “It’s not"
5751,"like, you know, Riddle’s diary. It’s just an old textbook someone’s"
5752,scribbled on.”
5753,“But you’re doing what it says?”
5754,"“I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins, honestly,"
5755,"Ginny, there’s nothing funny —”"
5756,"“Ginny’s got a point,” said Hermione, perking up at once. “We"
5757,  192  
5758,THE HALF-BLOOD PRINCE
5759,"ought to check that there’s nothing odd about it. I mean, all these"
5760,"funny instructions, who knows?”"
5761,"“Hey!” said Harry indignantly, as she pulled his copy of"
5762,Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag and raised her wand.
5763,"“Specialis Revelio!” she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover."
5764,"Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, look-"
5765,ing old and dirty and dog-eared.
5766,“Finished?” said Harry irritably. “Or d’you want to wait and see
5767,if it does a few backflips?”
5768,"“It seems all right,” said Hermione, still staring at the book sus-"
5769,"piciously. “I mean, it really does seem to be . . . just a textbook.”"
5770,"“Good. Then I’ll have it back,” said Harry, snatching it off the"
5771,"table, but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor."
5772,"Nobody else was looking. Harry bent low to retrieve the book,"
5773,"and as he did so, he saw something scribbled along the bottom of"
5774,"the back cover in the same small, cramped handwriting as the in-"
5775,"structions that had won him his bottle of Felix Felicis, now safely"
5776,hidden inside a pair of socks in his trunk upstairs.
5777,This Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.

5780,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
5781,F     or the rest of the week’s Potions lessons Harry continued to
5782,follow the Half-Blood Prince’s instructions wherever they de-
5783,"viated from Libatius Borage’s, with the result that by their fourth"
5784,"lesson Slughorn was raving about Harry’s abilities, saying that he"
5785,had rarely taught anyone so talented. Neither Ron nor Hermione
5786,was delighted by this. Although Harry had offered to share his
5787,"book with both of them, Ron had more difficulty deciphering the"
5788,"handwriting than Harry did, and could not keep asking Harry to"
5789,"read aloud or it might look suspicious. Hermione, meanwhile, was"
5790,resolutely plowing on with what she called the “official” instruc-
5791,"tions, but becoming increasingly bad-tempered as they yielded"
5792,poorer results than the Prince’s.
5793,Harry wondered vaguely who the Half-Blood Prince had been.
5794,Although the amount of homework they had been given prevented
5795,"him from reading the whole of his copy of Advanced Potion-Making,"
5796,he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there was barely
5797,  194  
5798,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
5799,"a page on which the Prince had not made additional notes, not all"
5800,of them concerned with potion-making. Here and there were direc-
5801,tions for what looked like spells that the Prince had made up
5802,himself.
5803,"“Or herself,” said Hermione irritably, overhearing Harry point-"
5804,ing some of these out to Ron in the common room on Saturday
5805,evening. “It might have been a girl. I think the handwriting looks
5806,more like a girl’s than a boy’s.”
5807,"“The Half-Blood Prince, he was called,” Harry said. “How many"
5808,girls have been Princes?”
5809,Hermione seemed to have no answer to this. She merely scowled
5810,and twitched her essay on The Principles of Rematerialization away
5811,"from Ron, who was trying to read it upside down."
5812,Harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of
5813,Advanced Potion-Making back into his bag.
5814,"“It’s five to eight, I’d better go, I’ll be late for Dumbledore.”"
5815,"“Ooooh!” gasped Hermione, looking up at once. “Good luck!"
5816,"We’ll wait up, we want to hear what he teaches you!”"
5817,"“Hope it goes okay,” said Ron, and the pair of them watched"
5818,Harry leave through the portrait hole.
5819,"Harry proceeded through deserted corridors, though he had to"
5820,step hastily behind a statue when Professor Trelawney appeared
5821,"around a corner, muttering to herself as she shuffled a pack of"
5822,"dirty-looking playing cards, reading them as she walked."
5823,"“Two of spades: conflict,” she murmured, as she passed the place"
5824,"where Harry crouched, hidden. “Seven of spades: an ill omen. Ten"
5825,"of spades: violence. Knave of spades: a dark young man, possibly"
5826,"troubled, one who dislikes the questioner —”"
5827,"She stopped dead, right on the other side of Harry’s statue."
5828, 195    
5829,CHAPTER TEN
5830,"“Well, that can’t be right,” she said, annoyed, and Harry heard"
5831,"her reshuffling vigorously as she set off again, leaving nothing but"
5832,a whiff of cooking sherry behind her. Harry waited until he was
5833,"quite sure she had gone, then hurried off again until he reached the"
5834,spot in the seventh-floor corridor where a single gargoyle stood
5835,against the wall.
5836,"“Acid Pops,” said Harry, and the gargoyle leapt aside; the wall"
5837,"behind it slid apart, and a moving spiral stone staircase was re-"
5838,"vealed, onto which Harry stepped, so that he was carried in smooth"
5839,circles up to the door with the brass knocker that led to Dumble-
5840,dore’s office.
5841,Harry knocked.
5842,"“Come in,” said Dumbledore’s voice."
5843,"“Good evening, sir,” said Harry, walking into the headmaster’s"
5844,office.
5845,"“Ah, good evening, Harry. Sit down,” said Dumbledore, smil-"
5846,ing. “I hope you’ve had an enjoyable first week back at school?”
5847,"“Yes, thanks, sir,” said Harry."
5848,"“You must have been busy, a detention under your belt already!”"
5849,"“Er,” began Harry awkwardly, but Dumbledore did not look too"
5850,stern.
5851,“I have arranged with Professor Snape that you will do your de-
5852,tention next Saturday instead.”
5853,"“Right,” said Harry, who had more pressing matters on his mind"
5854,"than Snape’s detention, and now looked around surreptitiously"
5855,for some indication of what Dumbledore was planning to do with
5856,him this evening. The circular office looked just as it always did;
5857,"the delicate silver instruments stood on spindle-legged tables, puff-"
5858,ing smoke and whirring; portraits of previous headmasters and
5859,  196  
5860,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
5861,"headmistresses dozed in their frames, and Dumbledore’s magnifi-"
5862,"cent phoenix, Fawkes, stood on his perch behind the door, watch-"
5863,ing Harry with bright interest. It did not even look as though
5864,Dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice.
5865,"“So, Harry,” said Dumbledore, in a businesslike voice. “You"
5866,"have been wondering, I am sure, what I have planned for you dur-"
5867,ing these — for want of a better word — lessons?”
5868,"“Yes, sir.”"
5869,"“Well, I have decided that it is time, now that you know what"
5870,"prompted Lord Voldemort to try and kill you fifteen years ago, for"
5871,you to be given certain information.”
5872,There was a pause.
5873,"“You said, at the end of last term, you were going to tell me"
5874,"everything,” said Harry. It was hard to keep a note of accusation"
5875,"from his voice. “Sir,” he added."
5876,"“And so I did,” said Dumbledore placidly. “I told you everything"
5877,"I know. From this point forth, we shall be leaving the firm founda-"
5878,tion of fact and journeying together through the murky marshes of
5879,"memory into thickets of wildest guesswork. From here on in,"
5880,"Harry, I may be as woefully wrong as Humphrey Belcher, who be-"
5881,lieved the time was ripe for a cheese cauldron.”
5882,“But you think you’re right?” said Harry.
5883,"“Naturally I do, but as I have already proven to you, I make mis-"
5884,"takes like the next man. In fact, being — forgive me — rather clev-"
5885,"erer than most men, my mistakes tend to be correspondingly"
5886,huger.”
5887,"“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “does what you’re going to tell me"
5888,have anything to do with the prophecy? Will it help me . . .
5889,survive?”
5890, 197   
5891,CHAPTER TEN
5892,"“It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy,” said Dumble-"
5893,"dore, as casually as if Harry had asked him about the next day’s"
5894,"weather, “and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive.”"
5895,"Dumbledore got to his feet and walked around the desk, past"
5896,"Harry, who turned eagerly in his seat to watch Dumbledore bend-"
5897,ing over the cabinet beside the door. When Dumbledore straight-
5898,"ened up, he was holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with"
5899,odd markings around its rim. He placed the Pensieve on the desk in
5900,front of Harry.
5901,“You look worried.”
5902,Harry had indeed been eyeing the Pensieve with some appre-
5903,hension. His previous experiences with the odd device that stored
5904,"and revealed thoughts and memories, though highly instructive,"
5905,had also been uncomfortable. The last time he had disturbed its
5906,"contents, he had seen much more than he would have wished. But"
5907,Dumbledore was smiling.
5908,"“This time, you enter the Pensieve with me . . . and, even more"
5909,"unusually, with permission.”"
5910,"“Where are we going, sir?”"
5911,"“For a trip down Bob Ogden’s memory lane,” said Dumbledore,"
5912,pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling
5913,silvery-white substance.
5914,“Who was Bob Ogden?”
5915,“He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforce-
5916,"ment,” said Dumbledore. “He died some time ago, but not before"
5917,I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recol-
5918,lections to me. We are about to accompany him on a visit he made
5919,"in the course of his duties. If you will stand, Harry . . .”"
5920, 198  
5921,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
5922,But Dumbledore was having difficulty pulling out the stopper of
5923,the crystal bottle: His injured hand seemed stiff and painful.
5924,"“Shall — shall I, sir?”"
5925,"“No matter, Harry —”"
5926,Dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew
5927,out.
5928,"“Sir — how did you injure your hand?” Harry asked again, look-"
5929,ing at the blackened fingers with a mixture of revulsion and pity.
5930,"“Now is not the moment for that story, Harry. Not yet. We have"
5931,an appointment with Bob Ogden.”
5932,Dumbledore tipped the silvery contents of the bottle into the
5933,"Pensieve, where they swirled and shimmered, neither liquid nor gas."
5934,"“After you,” said Dumbledore, gesturing toward the bowl."
5935,"Harry bent forward, took a deep breath, and plunged his face"
5936,into the silvery substance. He felt his feet leave the office floor; he
5937,"was falling, falling through whirling darkness and then, quite sud-"
5938,"denly, he was blinking in dazzling sunlight. Before his eyes had"
5939,"adjusted, Dumbledore landed beside him."
5940,"They were standing in a country lane bordered by high, tangled"
5941,"hedgerows, beneath a summer sky as bright and blue as a forget-"
5942,"me-not. Some ten feet in front of them stood a short, plump man"
5943,wearing enormously thick glasses that reduced his eyes to molelike
5944,specks. He was reading a wooden signpost that was sticking out of
5945,the brambles on the left-hand side of the road. Harry knew this
5946,"must be Ogden; he was the only person in sight, and he was also"
5947,wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inex-
5948,"perienced wizards trying to look like Muggles: in this case, a frock"
5949,coat and spats over a striped one-piece bathing costume. Before

5952,"Harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance,"
5953,"however, Ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane."
5954,Dumbledore and Harry followed. As they passed the wooden
5955,"sign, Harry looked up at its two arms. The one pointing back the"
5956,"way they had come read: Great Hangleton, 5 miles. The arm"
5957,"pointing after Ogden said Little Hangleton, 1 mile."
5958,"They walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerows,"
5959,"the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing, frock-coated figure"
5960,"ahead. Then the lane curved to the left and fell away, sloping"
5961,"steeply down a hillside, so that they had a sudden, unexpected view"
5962,of a whole valley laid out in front of them. Harry could see a vil-
5963,"lage, undoubtedly Little Hangleton, nestled between two steep"
5964,"hills, its church and graveyard clearly visible. Across the valley, set"
5965,"on the opposite hillside, was a handsome manor house surrounded"
5966,by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn.
5967,Ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep down-
5968,"ward slope. Dumbledore lengthened his stride, and Harry hurried"
5969,to keep up. He thought Little Hangleton must be their final desti-
5970,"nation and wondered, as he had done on the night they had found"
5971,"Slughorn, why they had to approach it from such a distance. He"
5972,soon discovered that he was mistaken in thinking that they were
5973,"going to the village, however. The lane curved to the right and"
5974,"when they rounded the corner, it was to see the very edge of Og-"
5975,den’s frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge.
5976,Dumbledore and Harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track
5977,bordered by higher and wilder hedgerows than those they had left
5978,"behind. The path was crooked, rocky, and potholed, sloping down-"
5979,"hill like the last one, and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark"
5980,"trees a little below them. Sure enough, the track soon opened up"
5981, 200  
5982,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
5983,"at the copse, and Dumbledore and Harry came to a halt behind"
5984,"Ogden, who had stopped and drawn his wand."
5985,"Despite the cloudless sky, the old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool"
5986,"shadows, and it was a few seconds before Harry’s eyes discerned the"
5987,building half-hidden amongst the tangle of trunks. It seemed to him
5988,"a very strange location to choose for a house, or else an odd decision"
5989,"to leave the trees growing nearby, blocking all light and the view of"
5990,the valley below. He wondered whether it was inhabited; its walls
5991,were mossy and so many tiles had fallen off the roof that the rafters
5992,"were visible in places. Nettles grew all around it, their tips reaching"
5993,"the windows, which were tiny and thick with grime. Just as he had"
5994,"concluded that nobody could possibly live there, however, one of"
5995,"the windows was thrown open with a clatter, and a thin trickle of"
5996,"steam or smoke issued from it, as though somebody was cooking."
5997,"Ogden moved forward quietly and, it seemed to Harry, rather"
5998,"cautiously. As the dark shadows of the trees slid over him, he"
5999,"stopped again, staring at the front door, to which somebody had"
6000,nailed a dead snake.
6001,"Then there was a rustle and a crack, and a man in rags dropped"
6002,"from the nearest tree, landing on his feet right in front of Ogden,"
6003,who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tails of his frock coat
6004,and stumbled.
6005,“You’re not welcome.”
6006,The man standing before them had thick hair so matted with
6007,dirt it could have been any color. Several of his teeth were missing.
6008,His eyes were small and dark and stared in opposite directions. He
6009,"might have looked comical, but he did not; the effect was frighten-"
6010,"ing, and Harry could not blame Ogden for backing away several"
6011,more paces before he spoke.
6012, 201   
6013,CHAPTER TEN
6014,“Er — good morning. I’m from the Ministry of Magic —”
6015,“You’re not welcome.”
6016,"“Er — I’m sorry — I don’t understand you,” said Ogden"
6017,nervously.
6018,Harry thought Ogden was being extremely dim; the stranger
6019,"was making himself very clear in Harry’s opinion, particularly as he"
6020,was brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody
6021,knife in the other.
6022,"“You understand him, I’m sure, Harry?” said Dumbledore quietly."
6023,"“Yes, of course,” said Harry, slightly nonplussed. “Why can’t"
6024,Ogden — ?”
6025,"But as his eyes found the dead snake on the door again, he sud-"
6026,denly understood.
6027,“He’s speaking Parseltongue?”
6028,"“Very good,” said Dumbledore, nodding and smiling."
6029,"The man in rags was now advancing on Ogden, knife in one"
6030,"hand, wand in the other."
6031,"“Now, look —” Ogden began, but too late: There was a bang,"
6032,"and Ogden was on the ground, clutching his nose, while a nasty"
6033,yellowish goo squirted from between his fingers.
6034,“Morfin!” said a loud voice.
6035,"An elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage, banging"
6036,the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically.
6037,"This man was shorter than the first, and oddly proportioned; his"
6038,"shoulders were very broad and his arms overlong, which, with his"
6039,"bright brown eyes, short scrubby hair, and wrinkled face, gave him"
6040,"the look of a powerful, aged monkey. He came to a halt beside the"
6041,"man with the knife, who was now cackling with laughter at the"
6042,sight of Ogden on the ground.
6043,  202 
6044,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
6045,"“Ministry, is it?” said the older man, looking down at Ogden."
6046,"“Correct!” said Ogden angrily, dabbing his face. “And you, I take"
6047,"it, are Mr. Gaunt?”"
6048,"“S’right,” said Gaunt. “Got you in the face, did he?”"
6049,"“Yes, he did!” snapped Ogden."
6050,"“Should’ve made your presence known, shouldn’t you?” said"
6051,Gaunt aggressively. “This is private property. Can’t just walk in
6052,here and not expect my son to defend himself.”
6053,"“Defend himself against what, man?” said Ogden, clambering"
6054,back to his feet.
6055,“Busybodies. Intruders. Muggles and filth.”
6056,"Ogden pointed his wand at his own nose, which was still issuing"
6057,"large amounts of what looked like yellow pus, and the flow stopped"
6058,at once. Mr. Gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to Morfin.
6059,“Get in the house. Don’t argue.”
6060,"This time, ready for it, Harry recognized Parseltongue; even"
6061,"while he could understand what was being said, he distinguished"
6062,the weird hissing noise that was all Ogden could hear. Morfin
6063,"seemed to be on the point of disagreeing, but when his father cast"
6064,"him a threatening look he changed his mind, lumbering away to"
6065,the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door
6066,"behind him, so that the snake swung sadly again."
6067,"“It’s your son I’m here to see, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, as he"
6068,mopped the last of the pus from the front of his coat. “That was
6069,"Morfin, wasn’t it?”"
6070,"“Ar, that was Morfin,” said the old man indifferently. “Are you"
6071,"pure-blood?” he asked, suddenly aggressive."
6072,"“That’s neither here nor there,” said Ogden coldly, and Harry"
6073,felt his respect for Ogden rise. Apparently Gaunt felt rather
6074, 203 
6075,CHAPTER TEN
6076,"differently. He squinted into Ogden’s face and muttered, in what"
6077,"was clearly supposed to be an offensive tone, “Now I come to think"
6078,"about it, I’ve seen noses like yours down in the village.”"
6079,"“I don’t doubt it, if your son’s been let loose on them,” said Og-"
6080,den. “Perhaps we could continue this discussion inside?”
6081,“Inside?”
6082,"“Yes, Mr. Gaunt. I’ve already told you. I’m here about Morfin."
6083,We sent an owl —”
6084,"“I’ve no use for owls,” said Gaunt. “I don’t open letters.”"
6085,“Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of vis-
6086,"itors,” said Ogden tartly. “I am here following a serious breach of"
6087,"Wizarding law, which occurred here in the early hours of this"
6088,morning —”
6089,"“All right, all right, all right!” bellowed Gaunt. “Come in the"
6090,"bleeding house, then, and much good it’ll do you!”"
6091,The house seemed to contain three tiny rooms. Two doors led
6092,"off the main room, which served as kitchen and living room com-"
6093,bined. Morfin was sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking
6094,"fire, twisting a live adder between his thick fingers and crooning"
6095,softly at it in Parseltongue:
6096,"Hissy, hissy, little snakey,"
6097,"Slither on the floor,"
6098,You be good to Morfin
6099,Or he’ll nail you to the door.
6100,There was a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open win-
6101,"dow, and Harry realized that there was somebody else in the room,"
6102,a girl whose ragged gray dress was the exact color of the dirty stone
6103,  204    
6104,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
6105,wall behind her. She was standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy
6106,"black stove, and was fiddling around with the shelf of squalid-"
6107,looking pots and pans above it. Her hair was lank and dull and she
6108,"had a plain, pale, rather heavy face. Her eyes, like her brother’s,"
6109,stared in opposite directions. She looked a little cleaner than the
6110,"two men, but Harry thought he had never seen a more defeated-"
6111,looking person.
6112,"“M’daughter, Merope,” said Gaunt grudgingly, as Ogden looked"
6113,inquiringly toward her.
6114,"“Good morning,” said Ogden."
6115,"She did not answer, but with a frightened glance at her father"
6116,turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pots on
6117,the shelf behind her.
6118,"“Well, Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden, “to get straight to the point, we"
6119,"have reason to believe that your son, Morfin, performed magic in"
6120,front of a Muggle late last night.”
6121,There was a deafening clang. Merope had dropped one of the
6122,pots.
6123,"“Pick it up!” Gaunt bellowed at her. “That’s it, grub on the floor"
6124,"like some filthy Muggle, what’s your wand for, you useless sack of"
6125,muck?”
6126,"“Mr. Gaunt, please!” said Ogden in a shocked voice, as Merope,"
6127,"who had already picked up the pot, flushed blotchily scarlet, lost"
6128,"her grip on the pot again, drew her wand shakily from her pocket,"
6129,"pointed it at the pot, and muttered a hasty, inaudible spell that"
6130,"caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her, hit the op-"
6131,"posite wall, and crack in two."
6132,"Morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter. Gaunt screamed,"
6133,"“Mend it, you pointless lump, mend it!”"
6134, 205 
6135,CHAPTER TEN
6136,"Merope stumbled across the room, but before she had time to"
6137,"raise her wand, Ogden had lifted his own and said firmly, “Reparo.”"
6138,The pot mended itself instantly.
6139,Gaunt looked for a moment as though he was going to shout at
6140,"Ogden, but seemed to think better of it: Instead, he jeered at his"
6141,"daughter, “Lucky the nice man from the Ministry’s here, isn’t it?"
6142,"Perhaps he’ll take you off my hands, perhaps he doesn’t mind dirty"
6143,Squibs. . . .”
6144,"Without looking at anybody or thanking Ogden, Merope"
6145,"picked up the pot and returned it, hands trembling, to its shelf. She"
6146,"then stood quite still, her back against the wall between the filthy"
6147,"window and the stove, as though she wished for nothing more than"
6148,to sink into the stone and vanish.
6149,"“Mr. Gaunt,” Ogden began again, “as I’ve said: the reason for"
6150,my visit —”
6151,“I heard you the first time!” snapped Gaunt. “And so what?
6152,Morfin gave a Muggle a bit of what was coming to him — what
6153,"about it, then?”"
6154,"“Morfin has broken Wizarding law,” said Ogden sternly."
6155,“ ‘Morfin has broken Wizarding law.’ ” Gaunt imitated Ogden’s
6156,"voice, making it pompous and singsong. Morfin cackled again."
6157,"“He taught a filthy Muggle a lesson, that’s illegal now, is it?”"
6158,"“Yes,” said Ogden. “I’m afraid it is.”"
6159,He pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and
6160,unrolled it.
6161,"“What’s that, then, his sentence?” said Gaunt, his voice rising"
6162,angrily.
6163,“It is a summons to the Ministry for a hearing —”
6164, 206   
6165,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
6166,"“Summons! Summons? Who do you think you are, summoning"
6167,my son anywhere?”
6168,"“I’m Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Squad,” said Ogden."
6169,"“And you think we’re scum, do you?” screamed Gaunt, advanc-"
6170,"ing on Ogden now, with a dirty yellow-nailed finger pointing at his"
6171,chest. “Scum who’ll come running when the Ministry tells ’em to?
6172,"Do you know who you’re talking to, you filthy little Mudblood, do"
6173,you?
6174,"“I was under the impression that I was speaking to Mr. Gaunt,”"
6175,"said Ogden, looking wary, but standing his ground."
6176,"“That’s right!” roared Gaunt. For a moment, Harry thought"
6177,"Gaunt was making an obscene hand gesture, but then realized that"
6178,"he was showing Ogden the ugly, black-stoned ring he was wearing"
6179,"on his middle finger, waving it before Ogden’s eyes. “See this? See"
6180,this? Know what it is? Know where it came from? Centuries it’s
6181,"been in our family, that’s how far back we go, and pure-blood all"
6182,"the way! Know how much I’ve been offered for this, with the"
6183,Peverell coat of arms engraved on the stone?”
6184,"“I’ve really no idea,” said Ogden, blinking as the ring sailed"
6185,"within an inch of his nose, “and it’s quite beside the point, Mr."
6186,Gaunt. Your son has committed —”
6187,"With a howl of rage, Gaunt ran toward his daughter. For a split"
6188,"second, Harry thought he was going to throttle her as his hand flew"
6189,"to her throat; next moment, he was dragging her toward Ogden by"
6190,a gold chain around her neck.
6191,"“See this?” he bellowed at Ogden, shaking a heavy gold locket at"
6192,"him, while Merope spluttered and gasped for breath."
6193,"“I see it, I see it!” said Ogden hastily."
6194, 207  
6195,CHAPTER TEN
6196,“Slytherin’s!” yelled Gaunt. “Salazar Slytherin’s! We’re his last liv-
6197,"ing descendants, what do you say to that, eh?”"
6198,"“Mr. Gaunt, your daughter!” said Ogden in alarm, but Gaunt"
6199,"had already released Merope; she staggered away from him, back to"
6200,"her corner, massaging her neck and gulping for air."
6201,"“So!” said Gaunt triumphantly, as though he had just proved a"
6202,complicated point beyond all possible dispute. “Don’t you go talk-
6203,"ing to us as if we’re dirt on your shoes! Generations of purebloods,"
6204,"wizards all — more than you can say, I don’t doubt!”"
6205,And he spat on the floor at Ogden’s feet. Morfin cackled again.
6206,"Merope, huddled beside the window, her head bowed and her face"
6207,"hidden by her lank hair, said nothing."
6208,"“Mr. Gaunt,” said Ogden doggedly, “I am afraid that neither"
6209,your ancestors nor mine have anything to do with the matter in
6210,"hand. I am here because of Morfin, Morfin and the Muggle he ac-"
6211,costed late last night. Our information” — he glanced down at his
6212,scroll of parchment — “is that Morfin performed a jinx or hex on
6213,"the said Muggle, causing him to erupt in highly painful hives.”"
6214,Morfin giggled.
6215,"“Be quiet, boy,” snarled Gaunt in Parseltongue, and Morfin fell"
6216,silent again.
6217,"“And so what if he did, then?” Gaunt said defiantly to Ogden. “I"
6218,"expect you’ve wiped the Muggle’s filthy face clean for him, and his"
6219,memory to boot —”
6220,"“That’s hardly the point, is it, Mr. Gaunt?” said Ogden. “This"
6221,was an unprovoked attack on a defenseless —”
6222,"“Ar, I had you marked out as a Muggle-lover the moment I saw"
6223,"you,” sneered Gaunt, and he spat on the floor again."
6224,"“This discussion is getting us nowhere,” said Ogden firmly. “It is"
6225, 208  
6226,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
6227,clear from your son’s attitude that he feels no remorse for his ac-
6228,tions.” He glanced down at his scroll of parchment again. “Morfin
6229,will attend a hearing on the fourteenth of September to answer the
6230,charges of using magic in front of a Muggle and causing harm and
6231,distress to that same Mugg —”
6232,"Ogden broke off. The jingling, clopping sounds of horses and"
6233,"loud, laughing voices were drifting in through the open window."
6234,Apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the
6235,"copse where the house stood. Gaunt froze, listening, his eyes wide."
6236,"Morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sounds, his expres-"
6237,"sion hungry. Merope raised her head. Her face, Harry saw, was"
6238,starkly white.
6239,"“My God, what an eyesore!” rang out a girl’s voice, as clearly au-"
6240,dible through the open window as if she had stood in the room be-
6241,"side them. “Couldn’t your father have that hovel cleared away,"
6242,Tom?”
6243,"“It’s not ours,” said a young man’s voice. “Everything on the"
6244,"other side of the valley belongs to us, but that cottage belongs to an"
6245,"old tramp called Gaunt, and his children. The son’s quite mad, you"
6246,should hear some of the stories they tell in the village —”
6247,"The girl laughed. The jingling, clopping noises were growing"
6248,louder and louder. Morfin made to get out of his armchair.
6249,"“Keep your seat,” said his father warningly, in Parseltongue."
6250,"“Tom,” said the girl’s voice again, now so close they were clearly"
6251,"right beside the house, “I might be wrong — but has somebody"
6252,nailed a snake to that door?”
6253,"“Good lord, you’re right!” said the man’s voice. “That’ll be the"
6254,"son, I told you he’s not right in the head. Don’t look at it, Cecilia,"
6255,darling.”

6258,The jingling and clopping sounds were now growing fainter
6259,again.
6260,"“ ‘Darling,’ ” whispered Morfin in Parseltongue, looking at his"
6261,"sister. “ ‘Darling,’ he called her. So he wouldn’t have you anyway.”"
6262,Merope was so white Harry felt sure she was going to faint.
6263,"“What’s that?” said Gaunt sharply, also in Parseltongue, looking"
6264,"from his son to his daughter. “What did you say, Morfin?”"
6265,"“She likes looking at that Muggle,” said Morfin, a vicious expres-"
6266,"sion on his face as he stared at his sister, who now looked terrified."
6267,"“Always in the garden when he passes, peering through the hedge at"
6268,"him, isn’t she? And last night —”"
6269,"Merope shook her head jerkily, imploringly, but Morfin went on"
6270,"ruthlessly, “Hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home,"
6271,wasn’t she?”
6272,“Hanging out of the window to look at a Muggle?” said Gaunt
6273,quietly.
6274,"All three of the Gaunts seemed to have forgotten Ogden, who"
6275,was looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak
6276,of incomprehensible hissing and rasping.
6277,"“Is it true?” said Gaunt in a deadly voice, advancing a step or two"
6278,toward the terrified girl. “My daughter — pure-blooded descendant
6279,"of Salazar Slytherin — hankering after a filthy, dirt-veined Muggle?”"
6280,"Merope shook her head frantically, pressing herself into the wall,"
6281,apparently unable to speak.
6282,"“But I got him, Father!” cackled Morfin. “I got him as he went by"
6283,"and he didn’t look so pretty with hives all over him, did he, Merope?”"
6284,"“You disgusting little Squib, you filthy little blood traitor!” roared"
6285,"Gaunt, losing control, and his hands closed around his daughter’s"
6286,throat.

6289,Both Harry and Ogden yelled “No!” at the same time; Ogden
6290,"raised his wand and cried, “Relashio!” Gaunt was thrown backward,"
6291,away from his daughter; he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his
6292,"back. With a roar of rage, Morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at"
6293,"Ogden, brandishing his bloody knife and firing hexes indiscrimi-"
6294,nately from his wand.
6295,Ogden ran for his life. Dumbledore indicated that they ought to
6296,"follow and Harry obeyed, Merope’s screams echoing in his ears."
6297,"Ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane, his"
6298,"arms over his head, where he collided with the glossy chestnut"
6299,"horse ridden by a very handsome, dark-haired young man. Both he"
6300,and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with
6301,"laughter at the sight of Ogden, who bounced off the horse’s flank"
6302,"and set off again, his frock coat flying, covered from head to foot in"
6303,"dust, running pell-mell up the lane."
6304,"“I think that will do, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He took Harry"
6305,"by the elbow and tugged. Next moment, they were both soaring"
6306,"weightlessly through darkness, until they landed squarely on their"
6307,"feet, back in Dumbledore’s now twilit office."
6308,"“What happened to the girl in the cottage?” said Harry at once,"
6309,"as Dumbledore lit extra lamps with a flick of his wand. “Merope, or"
6310,whatever her name was?”
6311,"“Oh, she survived,” said Dumbledore, reseating himself behind"
6312,his desk and indicating that Harry should sit down too. “Ogden
6313,Apparated back to the Ministry and returned with reinforcements
6314,"within fifteen minutes. Morfin and his father attempted to fight,"
6315,"but both were overpowered, removed from the cottage, and subse-"

6320,"Marvolo, who had injured several Ministry employees in addition"
6321,"to Ogden, received six months.”"
6322,“Marvolo?” Harry repeated wonderingly.
6323,"“That’s right,” said Dumbledore, smiling in approval. “I am glad"
6324,to see you’re keeping up.”
6325,“That old man was — ?”
6326,"“Voldemort’s grandfather, yes,” said Dumbledore. “Marvolo, his"
6327,"son, Morfin, and his daughter, Merope, were the last of the"
6328,"Gaunts, a very ancient Wizarding family noted for a vein of insta-"
6329,bility and violence that flourished through the generations due to
6330,their habit of marrying their own cousins. Lack of sense coupled
6331,with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold was

6333,"you saw, was left in squalor and poverty, with a very nasty temper,"
6334,"a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride, and a couple of family"

6338,"ing at Dumbledore, “so Merope was . . . Sir, does that mean she"
6339,was . . . Voldemort’s mother?”
6340,"“It does,” said Dumbledore. “And it so happens that we also had"
6341,a glimpse of Voldemort’s father. I wonder whether you noticed?”
6342,“The Muggle Morfin attacked? The man on the horse?”
6343,"“Very good indeed,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “Yes, that was"
6344,"Tom Riddle senior, the handsome Muggle who used to go riding"
6345,past the Gaunt cottage and for whom Merope Gaunt cherished a
6346,"secret, burning passion.”"
6347,"“And they ended up married?” Harry said in disbelief, unable to"
6348,imagine two people less likely to fall in love.
6349, 212   
6350,THE HOUSE OF GAUNT
6351,"“I think you are forgetting,” said Dumbledore, “that Merope"
6352,was a witch. I do not believe that her magical powers appeared to
6353,their best advantage when she was being terrorized by her father.
6354,"Once Marvolo and Morfin were safely in Azkaban, once she was"
6355,"alone and free for the first time in her life, then, I am sure, she was"
6356,able to give full rein to her abilities and to plot her escape from the
6357,desperate life she had led for eighteen years.
6358,“Can you not think of any measure Merope could have taken to
6359,"make Tom Riddle forget his Muggle companion, and fall in love"
6360,with her instead?”
6361,“The Imperius Curse?” Harry suggested. “Or a love potion?”
6362,"“Very good. Personally, I am inclined to think that she used a"
6363,"love potion. I am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her,"
6364,"and I do not think it would have been very difficult, some hot day,"
6365,"when Riddle was riding alone, to persuade him to take a drink of"
6366,"water. In any case, within a few months of the scene we have just"
6367,"witnessed, the village of Little Hangleton enjoyed a tremendous"
6368,scandal. You can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire’s son
6369,"ran off with the tramp’s daughter, Merope."
6370,“But the villagers’ shock was nothing to Marvolo’s. He returned
6371,"from Azkaban, expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his"
6372,"return with a hot meal ready on his table. Instead, he found a clear"
6373,"inch of dust and her note of farewell, explaining what she had done."
6374,"“From all that I have been able to discover, he never mentioned"
6375,her name or existence from that time forth. The shock of her de-
6376,sertion may have contributed to his early death — or perhaps he
6377,had simply never learned to feed himself. Azkaban had greatly
6378,"weakened Marvolo, and he did not live to see Morfin return to the"
6379,cottage.”

6381,CHAPTER TEN
6382,"“And Merope? She . . . she died, didn’t she? Wasn’t Voldemort"
6383,brought up in an orphanage?”
6384,"“Yes, indeed,” said Dumbledore. “We must do a certain amount"
6385,"of guessing here, although I do not think it is difficult to deduce"
6386,"what happened. You see, within a few months of their runaway"
6387,"marriage, Tom Riddle reappeared at the manor house in Little"
6388,Hangleton without his wife. The rumor flew around the neighbor-
6389,hood that he was talking of being ‘hoodwinked’ and ‘taken in.’
6390,"What he meant, I am sure, is that he had been under an enchant-"
6391,"ment that had now lifted, though I daresay he did not dare use"
6392,those precise words for fear of being thought insane. When they
6393,"heard what he was saying, however, the villagers guessed that"
6394,"Merope had lied to Tom Riddle, pretending that she was going to"
6395,"have his baby, and that he had married her for this reason.”"
6396,“But she did have his baby.”
6397,“But not until a year after they were married. Tom Riddle left
6398,her while she was still pregnant.”
6399,“What went wrong?” asked Harry. “Why did the love potion
6400,stop working?”
6401,"“Again, this is guesswork,” said Dumbledore, “but I believe that"
6402,"Merope, who was deeply in love with her husband, could not bear"
6403,to continue enslaving him by magical means. I believe that she
6404,"made the choice to stop giving him the potion. Perhaps, besotted"
6405,"as she was, she had convinced herself that he would by now have"
6406,fallen in love with her in return. Perhaps she thought he would stay
6407,"for the baby’s sake. If so, she was wrong on both counts. He left her,"
6408,"never saw her again, and never troubled to discover what became of"
6409,his son.”

6412,The sky outside was inky black and the lamps in Dumbledore’s
6413,office seemed to glow more brightly than before.
6414,"“I think that will do for tonight, Harry,” said Dumbledore after"
6415,a moment or two.
6416,"“Yes, sir,” said Harry."
6417,"He got to his feet, but did not leave."
6418,“Sir . . . is it important to know all this about Voldemort’s past?”
6419,"“Very important, I think,” said Dumbledore."
6420,“And it . . . it’s got something to do with the prophecy?”
6421,“It has everything to do with the prophecy.”
6422,"“Right,” said Harry, a little confused, but reassured all the same."
6423,"He turned to go, then another question occurred to him, and he"
6424,"turned back again. “Sir, am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione"
6425,everything you’ve told me?”
6426,"Dumbledore considered him for a moment, then said, “Yes, I"
6427,think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trust-
6428,"worthy. But Harry, I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat"
6429,any of this to anybody else. It would not be a good idea if word got
6430,"around how much I know, or suspect, about Lord Voldemort’s"
6431,secrets.”
6432,"“No, sir, I’ll make sure it’s just Ron and Hermione. Good"
6433,night.”
6434,"He turned away again, and was almost at the door when he saw"
6435,it. Sitting on one of the little spindle-legged tables that supported
6436,"so many frail-looking silver instruments, was an ugly gold ring set"
6437,"with a large, cracked, black stone."
6438,"“Sir,” said Harry, staring at it. “That ring —”"
6439,“Yes?” said Dumbledore.

6442,“You were wearing it when we visited Professor Slughorn that

6444,"“So I was,” Dumbledore agreed."
6445,"“But isn’t it . . . sir, isn’t it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed"
6446,Ogden?”
6447,Dumbledore bowed his head. “The very same.”
6448,“But how come — ? Have you always had it?”
6449,"“No, I acquired it very recently,” said Dumbledore. “A few days"
6450,"before I came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle’s, in fact.”"
6451,"“That would be around the time you injured your hand, then,"
6452,sir?”
6453,"“Around that time, yes, Harry.”"
6454,Harry hesitated. Dumbledore was smiling.
6455,"“Sir, how exactly — ?”"
6456,"“Too late, Harry! You shall hear the story another time. Good"

6463,"A        s Hermione had predicted, the sixth years’ free periods"
6464,were not the hours of blissful relaxation Ron had antici-
6465,"pated, but times in which to attempt to keep up with the vast"
6466,amount of homework they were being set. Not only were they
6467,"studying as though they had exams every day, but the lessons them-"
6468,selves had become more demanding than ever before. Harry barely
6469,understood half of what Professor McGonagall said to them these
6470,days; even Hermione had had to ask her to repeat instructions once
6471,"or twice. Incredibly, and to Hermione’s increasing resentment,"
6472,"Harry’s best subject had suddenly become Potions, thanks to the"
6473,Half-Blood Prince.
6474,"Nonverbal spells were now expected, not only in Defense"
6475,"Against the Dark Arts, but in Charms and Transfiguration too."
6476,Harry frequently looked over at his classmates in the common
6477,room or at mealtimes to see them purple in the face and straining
6478,as though they had overdosed on U-No-Poo; but he knew that they
6479, 217   
6480,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6481,were really struggling to make spells work without saying incanta-
6482,tions aloud. It was a relief to get outside into the greenhouses; they
6483,"were dealing with more dangerous plants than ever in Herbology,"
6484,but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the Venomous
6485,Tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind.
6486,One result of their enormous workload and the frantic hours of
6487,"practicing nonverbal spells was that Harry, Ron, and Hermione"
6488,had so far been unable to find time to go and visit Hagrid. He had
6489,"stopped coming to meals at the staff table, an ominous sign, and on"
6490,the few occasions when they had passed him in the corridors or out
6491,"in the grounds, he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear"
6492,their greetings.
6493,"“We’ve got to go and explain,” said Hermione, looking up at"
6494,Hagrid’s huge empty chair at the staff table the following Saturday
6495,at breakfast.
6496,“We’ve got Quidditch tryouts this morning!” said Ron. “And
6497,we’re supposed to be practicing that Aguamenti Charm from
6498,"Flitwick! Anyway, explain what? How are we going to tell him we"
6499,hated his stupid subject?”
6500,“We didn’t hate it!” said Hermione.
6501,"“Speak for yourself, I haven’t forgotten the skrewts,” said Ron"
6502,"darkly. “And I’m telling you now, we’ve had a narrow escape. You"
6503,didn’t hear him going on about his gormless brother — we’d have
6504,been teaching Grawp how to tie his shoelaces if we’d stayed.”
6505,"“I hate not talking to Hagrid,” said Hermione, looking upset."
6506,"“We’ll go down after Quidditch,” Harry assured her. He too was"
6507,"missing Hagrid, although like Ron he thought that they were bet-"
6508,ter off without Grawp in their lives. “But trials might take all

6510, 218 

6512,HELPING HAND
6513,nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his Captaincy. “I dunno
6514,why the team’s this popular all of a sudden.”
6515,"“Oh, come on, Harry,” said Hermione, suddenly impatient. “It’s"
6516,"not Quidditch that’s popular, it’s you! You’ve never been more in-"
6517,"teresting, and frankly, you’ve never been more fanciable.”"
6518,Ron gagged on a large piece of kipper. Hermione spared him one
6519,look of disdain before turning back to Harry.
6520,"“Everyone knows you’ve been telling the truth now, don’t they?"
6521,The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right
6522,about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him
6523,twice in the last two years and escaped both times. And now they’re
6524,"calling you ‘the Chosen One’ — well, come on, can’t you see why"
6525,people are fascinated by you?”
6526,"Harry was finding the Great Hall very hot all of a sudden, even"
6527,though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy.
6528,“And you’ve been through all that persecution from the Ministry
6529,when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar.
6530,You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil

6533,“You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Min-

6535,“And it doesn’t hurt that you’ve grown about a foot over the

6537,"“I’m tall,” said Ron inconsequentially."
6538,"The post owls arrived, swooping down through rain-flecked"

6544,well at home. Harry had received no mail since the start of term;
6545,his only regular correspondent was now dead and although he had
6546,"hoped that Lupin might write occasionally, he had so far been dis-"
6547,"appointed. He was very surprised, therefore, to see the snowy white"
6548,Hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owls. She landed
6549,"in front of him carrying a large, square package. A moment later,"
6550,"an identical package landed in front of Ron, crushing beneath it his"
6551,"minuscule and exhausted owl, Pigwidgeon."
6552,"“Ha!” said Harry, unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of"
6553,"Advanced Potion-Making, fresh from Flourish and Blotts."
6554,"“Oh good,” said Hermione, delighted. “Now you can give that"
6555,graffitied copy back.”
6556,"“Are you mad?” said Harry. “I’m keeping it! Look, I’ve thought"
6557,it out —”
6558,He pulled the old copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his
6559,"bag and tapped the cover with his wand, muttering, “Diffindo!”"
6560,The cover fell off. He did the same thing with the brand-new book
6561,"(Hermione looked scandalized). He then swapped the covers,"
6562,"tapped each, and said, “Reparo!”"
6563,"There sat the Prince’s copy, disguised as a new book, and there"
6564,"sat the fresh copy from Flourish and Blotts, looking thoroughly"
6565,secondhand.
6566,"“I’ll give Slughorn back the new one, he can’t complain, it cost"

6568,"Hermione pressed her lips together, looking angry and disap-"

6575,“Anyone we know dead?” asked Ron in a determinedly casual
6576,voice; he posed the same question every time Hermione opened
6577,her paper.
6578,"“No, but there have been more dementor attacks,” said Hermi-"
6579,one. “And an arrest.”
6580,"“Excellent, who?” said Harry, thinking of Bellatrix Lestrange."
6581,"“Stan Shunpike,” said Hermione."
6582,"“What?” said Harry, startled."
6583,"“ ‘Stanley Shunpike, conductor on the popular Wizarding con-"

6585,"activity. Mr. Shunpike, 21, was taken into custody late last night after"
6586,a raid on his Clapham home . . .’ ”
6587,"“Stan Shunpike, a Death Eater?” said Harry, remembering the"
6588,spotty youth he had first met three years before. “No way!”
6589,"“He might have been put under the Imperius Curse,” said Ron"
6590,reasonably. “You never can tell.”
6591,"“It doesn’t look like it,” said Hermione, who was still reading. “It"
6592,says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the
6593,Death Eaters’ secret plans in a pub.” She looked up with a troubled
6594,"expression on her face. “If he was under the Imperius Curse, he’d"
6595,"hardly stand around gossiping about their plans, would he?”"
6596,“It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he
6597,"did,” said Ron. “Isn’t he the one who claimed he was going to be-"
6598,come Minister of Magic when he was trying to chat up those veela?”
6599,"“Yeah, that’s him,” said Harry. “I dunno what they’re playing at,"
6600,taking Stan seriously.”
6601,“They probably want to look as though they’re doing some-

6605,the Patil twins’ parents want them to go home? And Eloise Midgen
6606,has already been withdrawn. Her father picked her up last night.”
6607,"“What!” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “But Hogwarts is"
6608,"safer than their homes, bound to be! We’ve got Aurors, and all"
6609,"those extra protective spells, and we’ve got Dumbledore!”"
6610,"“I don’t think we’ve got him all the time,” said Hermione very"
6611,"quietly, glancing toward the staff table over the top of the Prophet."
6612,“Haven’t you noticed? His seat’s been empty as often as Hagrid’s
6613,this past week.”
6614,Harry and Ron looked up at the staff table. The headmaster’s
6615,"chair was indeed empty. Now Harry came to think of it, he had not"
6616,seen Dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago.
6617,"“I think he’s left the school to do something with the Order,”"
6618,"said Hermione in a low voice. “I mean . . . it’s all looking serious,"
6619,isn’t it?
6620,"Harry and Ron did not answer, but Harry knew that they were"
6621,all thinking the same thing. There had been a horrible incident the
6622,"day before, when Hannah Abbott had been taken out of Herbol-"
6623,ogy to be told her mother had been found dead. They had not seen
6624,Hannah since.
6625,When they left the Gryffindor table five minutes later to head
6626,"down to the Quidditch pitch, they passed Lavender Brown and"
6627,Parvati Patil. Remembering what Hermione had said about the
6628,"Patil twins’ parents wanting them to leave Hogwarts, Harry was"
6629,unsurprised to see that the two best friends were whispering to-
6630,"gether, looking distressed. What did surprise him was that when"
6631,"Ron drew level with them, Parvati suddenly nudged Lavender, who"
6632,"looked around and gave Ron a wide smile. Ron blinked at her, then"
6633,returned the smile uncertainly. His walk instantly became some-
6634, 222 
6635,HERMIONE’S
6636,HELPING HAND
6637,"thing more like a strut. Harry resisted the temptation to laugh, re-"
6638,membering that Ron had refrained from doing so after Malfoy had
6639,"broken Harry’s nose; Hermione, however, looked cold and distant"
6640,"all the way down to the stadium through the cool, misty drizzle,"
6641,and departed to find a place in the stands without wishing Ron
6642,good luck.
6643,"As Harry had expected, the trials took most of the morning."
6644,"Half of Gryffindor House seemed to have turned up, from first"
6645,years who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old
6646,"school brooms, to seventh years who towered over the rest, looking"
6647,"coolly intimidating. The latter included a large, wiry-haired boy"
6648,Harry recognized immediately from the Hogwarts Express.
6649,"“We met on the train, in old Sluggy’s compartment,” he said"
6650,"confidently, stepping out of the crowd to shake Harry’s hand."
6651,"“Cormac McLaggen, Keeper.”"
6652,"“You didn’t try out last year, did you?” asked Harry, taking note"
6653,of the breadth of McLaggen and thinking that he would probably
6654,block all three goal hoops without even moving.
6655,"“I was in the hospital wing when they held the trials,” said"
6656,"McLaggen, with something of a swagger. “Ate a pound of doxy eggs"
6657,for a bet.”
6658,"“Right,” said Harry. “Well . . . if you wait over there . . .”"
6659,"He pointed over to the edge of the pitch, close to where Hermi-"
6660,one was sitting. He thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pass over
6661,McLaggen’s face and wondered whether McLaggen expected pref-
6662,erential treatment because they were both “old Sluggy’s” favorites.
6663,"Harry decided to start with a basic test, asking all applicants for"
6664,the team to divide into groups of ten and fly once around the pitch.
6665,This was a good decision: The first ten was made up of first years
6666,  223   
6667,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6668,and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown
6669,before. Only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a
6670,"few seconds, and he was so surprised he promptly crashed into one"
6671,of the goal posts.
6672,The second group was comprised of ten of the silliest girls Harry
6673,"had ever encountered, who, when he blew his whistle, merely fell"
6674,about giggling and clutching one another. Romilda Vane was
6675,"amongst them. When he told them to leave the pitch, they did so"
6676,quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stands to heckle everyone
6677,else.
6678,The third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch. Most of
6679,the fourth group had come without broomsticks. The fifth group
6680,were Hufflepuffs.
6681,"“If there’s anyone else here who’s not from Gryffindor,” roared"
6682,"Harry, who was starting to get seriously annoyed, “leave now,"
6683,please!”
6684,"There was a pause, then a couple of little Ravenclaws went"
6685,"sprinting off the pitch, snorting with laughter."
6686,"After two hours, many complaints, and several tantrums, one in-"
6687,"volving a crashed Comet Two Sixty and several broken teeth, Harry"
6688,"had found himself three Chasers: Katie Bell, returned to the team"
6689,"after an excellent trial; a new find called Demelza Robins, who was"
6690,"particularly good at dodging Bludgers; and Ginny Weasley, who"
6691,had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goals to
6692,"boot. Pleased though he was with his choices, Harry had also"
6693,shouted himself hoarse at the many complainers and was now en-
6694,during a similar battle with the rejected Beaters.
6695,“That’s my final decision and if you don’t get out of the way for
6696,"the Keepers I’ll hex you,” he bellowed."
6697,  224  

6699,HELPING HAND
6700,Neither of his chosen Beaters had the old brilliance of Fred and
6701,"George, but he was still reasonably pleased with them: Jimmy"
6702,"Peakes, a short but broad-chested third-year boy who had managed"
6703,to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of Harry’s head with
6704,"a ferociously hit Bludger, and Ritchie Coote, who looked weedy"
6705,"but aimed well. They now joined Katie, Demelza, and Ginny in"
6706,the stands to watch the selection of their last team member.
6707,"Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last,"
6708,hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned.
6709,"Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of"
6710,people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had
6711,"joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever. As each"
6712,"Keeper flew up to the goal hoops, the crowd roared and jeered in"
6713,"equal measure. Harry glanced over at Ron, who had always had a"
6714,problem with nerves; Harry had hoped that winning their final
6715,"match last term might have cured it, but apparently not: Ron was"
6716,a delicate shade of green.
6717,None of the first five applicants saved more than two goals
6718,"apiece. To Harry’s great disappointment, Cormac McLaggen saved"
6719,"four penalties out of five. On the last one, however, he shot off in"
6720,completely the wrong direction; the crowd laughed and booed and
6721,McLaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth.
6722,Ron looked ready to pass out as he mounted his Cleansweep
6723,Eleven. “Good luck!” cried a voice from the stands. Harry looked
6724,"around, expecting to see Hermione, but it was Lavender Brown."
6725,"He would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hands, as"
6726,"she did a moment later, but thought that as the Captain he ought"
6727,"to show slightly more grit, and so turned to watch Ron do his trial."
6728,"Yet he need not have worried: Ron saved one, two, three, four,"
6729, 225   
6730,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6731,"five penalties in a row. Delighted, and resisting joining in the"
6732,"cheers of the crowd with difficulty, Harry turned to McLaggen to"
6733,"tell him that, most unfortunately, Ron had beaten him, only to"
6734,find McLaggen’s red face inches from his own. He stepped back
6735,hastily.
6736,"“His sister didn’t really try,” said McLaggen menacingly. There"
6737,was a vein pulsing in his temple like the one Harry had often ad-
6738,mired in Uncle Vernon’s. “She gave him an easy save.”
6739,"“Rubbish,” said Harry coldly. “That was the one he nearly"
6740,missed.”
6741,"McLaggen took a step nearer Harry, who stood his ground this"
6742,time.
6743,“Give me another go.”
6744,"“No,” said Harry. “You’ve had your go. You saved four. Ron"
6745,"saved five. Ron’s Keeper, he won it fair and square. Get out of my"
6746,way.”
6747,"He thought for a moment that McLaggen might punch him,"
6748,"but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away,"
6749,growling what sounded like threats to thin air.
6750,Harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him.
6751,"“Well done,” he croaked. “You flew really well —”"
6752,"“You did brilliantly, Ron!”"
6753,This time it really was Hermione running toward them from
6754,"the stands; Harry saw Lavender walking off the pitch, arm in arm"
6755,"with Parvati, a rather grumpy expression on her face. Ron looked"
6756,extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual as he
6757,grinned at the team and at Hermione.
6758,After fixing the time of their first full practice for the following
6759,"Thursday, Harry, Ron, and Hermione bade good-bye to the rest of"
6760,  226  
6761,HERMIONE’S
6762,HELPING HAND
6763,the team and headed off toward Hagrid’s. A watery sun was trying
6764,to break through the clouds now and it had stopped drizzling at
6765,last. Harry felt extremely hungry; he hoped there would be some-
6766,thing to eat at Hagrid’s.
6767,"“I thought I was going to miss that fourth penalty,” Ron was say-"
6768,"ing happily. “Tricky shot from Demelza, did you see, had a bit of"
6769,spin on it —”
6770,"“Yes, yes, you were magnificent,” said Hermione, looking amused."
6771,"“I was better than that McLaggen anyway,” said Ron in a highly"
6772,satisfied voice. “Did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direc-
6773,tion on his fifth? Looked like he’d been Confunded. . . .”
6774,"To Harry’s surprise, Hermione turned a very deep shade of pink"
6775,at these words. Ron noticed nothing; he was too busy describing
6776,each of his other penalties in loving detail.
6777,"The great gray hippogriff, Buckbeak, was tethered in front of"
6778,Hagrid’s cabin. He clicked his razor-sharp beak at their approach
6779,and turned his huge head toward them.
6780,"“Oh dear,” said Hermione nervously. “He’s still a bit scary, isn’t"
6781,he?”
6782,"“Come off it, you’ve ridden him, haven’t you?” said Ron."
6783,Harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without
6784,"breaking eye contact or blinking. After a few seconds, Buckbeak"
6785,sank into a bow too.
6786,"“How are you?” Harry asked him in a low voice, moving for-"
6787,ward to stroke the feathery head. “Missing him? But you’re okay
6788,"here with Hagrid, aren’t you?”"
6789,“Oi!” said a loud voice.
6790,Hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin
6791,wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potatoes. His
6792, 227  
6793,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6794,"enormous boarhound, Fang, was at his heels; Fang gave a booming"
6795,bark and bounded forward.
6796,“Git away from him! He’ll have yer fingers — oh. It’s yeh lot.”
6797,"Fang was jumping up at Hermione and Ron, attempting to lick"
6798,"their ears. Hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second,"
6799,"then turned and strode into his cabin, slamming the door behind"
6800,him.
6801,"“Oh dear!” said Hermione, looking stricken."
6802,"“Don’t worry about it,” said Harry grimly. He walked over to the"
6803,door and knocked loudly.
6804,"“Hagrid! Open up, we want to talk to you!”"
6805,There was no sound from within.
6806,"“If you don’t open the door, we’ll blast it open!” Harry said,"
6807,pulling out his wand.
6808,"“Harry!” said Hermione, sounding shocked. “You can’t pos-"
6809,sibly —”
6810,"“Yeah, I can!” said Harry. “Stand back —”"
6811,"But before he could say anything else, the door flew open again"
6812,"as Harry had known it would, and there stood Hagrid, glowering"
6813,"down at him and looking, despite the flowery apron, positively"
6814,alarming.
6815,"“I’m a teacher!” he roared at Harry. “A teacher, Potter! How dare"
6816,yeh threaten ter break down my door!”
6817,"“I’m sorry, sir,” said Harry, emphasizing the last word as he"
6818,stowed his wand inside his robes.
6819,Hagrid looked stunned. “Since when have yeh called me ‘sir’?”
6820,“Since when have you called me ‘Potter’?”
6821,"“Oh, very clever,” growled Hagrid. “Very amusin’. That’s me"
6822,"outsmarted, innit? All righ’, come in then, yeh ungrateful little . . .”"
6823, 228 
6824,HERMIONE’S
6825,HELPING HAND
6826,"Mumbling darkly, he stood back to let them pass. Hermione"
6827,"scurried in after Harry, looking rather frightened."
6828,"“Well?” said Hagrid grumpily, as Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat"
6829,"down around his enormous wooden table, Fang laying his head im-"
6830,mediately upon Harry’s knee and drooling all over his robes.
6831,“What’s this? Feelin’ sorry for me? Reckon I’m lonely or summat?”
6832,"“No,” said Harry at once. “We wanted to see you.”"
6833,“We’ve missed you!” said Hermione tremulously.
6834,"“Missed me, have yeh?” snorted Hagrid. “Yeah. Righ’.”"
6835,"He stomped around, brewing up tea in his enormous copper"
6836,"kettle, muttering all the while. Finally he slammed down three"
6837,bucket-sized mugs of mahogany-brown tea in front of them and a
6838,plate of his rock cakes. Harry was hungry enough even for Hagrid’s
6839,"cooking, and took one at once."
6840,"“Hagrid,” said Hermione timidly, when he joined them at the"
6841,table and started peeling his potatoes with a brutality that sug-
6842,"gested that each tuber had done him a great personal wrong, “we re-"
6843,"ally wanted to carry on with Care of Magical Creatures, you know.”"
6844,Hagrid gave another great snort. Harry rather thought some bo-
6845,"geys landed on the potatoes, and was inwardly thankful that they"
6846,were not staying for dinner.
6847,“We did!” said Hermione. “But none of us could fit it into our
6848,schedules!”
6849,"“Yeah. Righ’,” said Hagrid again."
6850,There was a funny squelching sound and they all looked around:
6851,"Hermione let out a tiny shriek, and Ron leapt out of his seat and"
6852,hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the
6853,corner that they had only just noticed. It was full of what looked
6854,"like foot-long maggots, slimy, white, and writhing."
6855, 229  
6856,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6857,"“What are they, Hagrid?” asked Harry, trying to sound inter-"
6858,"ested rather than revolted, but putting down his rock cake all the"
6859,same.
6860,"“Jus’ giant grubs,” said Hagrid."
6861,"“And they grow into . . . ?” said Ron, looking apprehensive."
6862,"“They won’ grow inter nuthin’,” said Hagrid. “I got ’em ter feed"
6863,ter Aragog.”
6864,"And without warning, he burst into tears."
6865,"“Hagrid!” cried Hermione, leaping up, hurrying around the"
6866,"table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggots, and putting an"
6867,arm around his shaking shoulders. “What is it?”
6868,"“It’s . . . him . . .” gulped Hagrid, his beetle-black eyes stream-"
6869,ing as he mopped his face with his apron. “It’s . . . Aragog. . . . I
6870,think he’s dyin’. . . . He got ill over the summer an’ he’s not gettin’
6871,better. . . . I don’ know what I’ll do if he . . . if he . . . We’ve bin
6872,tergether so long. . . .”
6873,"Hermione patted Hagrid’s shoulder, looking at a complete loss"
6874,for anything to say. Harry knew how she felt. He had known Ha-
6875,"grid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear, seen him"
6876,"croon over giant scorpions with suckers and stingers, attempt to"
6877,"reason with his brutal giant of a half-brother, but this was perhaps"
6878,the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancies: the gigantic
6879,"talking spider, Aragog, who dwelled deep in the Forbidden Forest"
6880,and which he and Ron had only narrowly escaped four years
6881,previously.
6882,"“Is there — is there anything we can do?” Hermione asked, ig-"
6883,noring Ron’s frantic grimaces and head-shakings.
6884,"“I don’ think there is, Hermione,” choked Hagrid, attempting"
6885,  230   
6886,HERMIONE’S
6887,HELPING HAND
6888,"to stem the flood of his tears. “See, the rest o’ the tribe . . . Aragog’s"
6889,family . . . they’re gettin’ a bit funny now he’s ill . . . bit restive . . .”
6890,"“Yeah, I think we saw a bit of that side of them,” said Ron in an"
6891,undertone.
6892,“. . . I don’ reckon it’d be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the
6893,"colony at the mo’,” Hagrid finished, blowing his nose hard on his"
6894,"apron and looking up. “But thanks fer offerin’, Hermione. . . . It"
6895,means a lot. . . .”
6896,"After that, the atmosphere lightened considerably, for although"
6897,neither Harry nor Ron had shown any inclination to go and feed
6898,"giant grubs to a murderous, gargantuan spider, Hagrid seemed to"
6899,take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and be-
6900,came his usual self once more.
6901,"“Ar, I always knew yeh’d find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer"
6902,"timetables,” he said gruffly, pouring them more tea. “Even if yeh"
6903,applied fer Time-Turners —”
6904,"“We couldn’t have done,” said Hermione. “We smashed the en-"
6905,tire stock of Ministry Time-Turners when we were there last sum-
6906,mer. It was in the Daily Prophet.”
6907,"“Ar, well then,” said Hagrid. “There’s no way yeh could’ve done"
6908,it. . . . I’m sorry I’ve bin — yeh know — I’ve jus’ bin worried abou’
6909,"Aragog . . . an’ I did wonder whether, if Professor Grubbly-Plank"
6910,had bin teachin’ yeh —”
6911,At which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully
6912,"that Professor Grubbly-Plank, who had substituted for Hagrid a"
6913,"few times, was a dreadful teacher, with the result that by the time"
6914,"Hagrid waved them off the premises at dusk, he looked quite"
6915,cheerful.
6916, 231  
6917,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6918,"“I’m starving,” said Harry, once the door had closed behind"
6919,them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted
6920,grounds; he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous crack-
6921,ing noise from one of his back teeth. “And I’ve got that detention
6922,"with Snape tonight, I haven’t got much time for dinner. . . .”"
6923,As they came into the castle they spotted Cormac McLaggen en-
6924,tering the Great Hall. It took him two attempts to get through the
6925,doors; he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt. Ron merely
6926,"guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the Hall after him, but"
6927,Harry caught Hermione’s arm and held her back.
6928,“What?” said Hermione defensively.
6929,"“If you ask me,” said Harry quietly, “McLaggen looks like he"
6930,was Confunded this morning. And he was standing right in front
6931,of where you were sitting.”
6932,Hermione blushed.
6933,"“Oh, all right then, I did it,” she whispered. “But you should"
6934,have heard the way he was talking about Ron and Ginny! Any-
6935,"way, he’s got a nasty temper, you saw how he reacted when he"
6936,didn’t get in — you wouldn’t have wanted someone like that on
6937,the team.”
6938,"“No,” said Harry. “No, I suppose that’s true. But wasn’t that dis-"
6939,"honest, Hermione? I mean, you’re a prefect, aren’t you?”"
6940,"“Oh, be quiet,” she snapped, as he smirked."
6941,"“What are you two doing?” demanded Ron, reappearing in the"
6942,doorway to the Great Hall and looking suspicious.
6943,"“Nothing,” said Harry and Hermione together, and they hurried"
6944,after Ron. The smell of roast beef made Harry’s stomach ache with
6945,"hunger, but they had barely taken three steps toward the Gryffin-"

6949,"dor table when Professor Slughorn appeared in front of them,"
6950,blocking their path.
6951,"“Harry, Harry, just the man I was hoping to see!” he boomed ge-"
6952,"nially, twiddling the ends of his walrus mustache and puffing out"
6953,his enormous belly. “I was hoping to catch you before dinner! What
6954,do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my rooms instead? We’re
6955,"having a little party, just a few rising stars, I’ve got McLaggen com-"
6956,"ing and Zabini, the charming Melinda Bobbin — I don’t know"
6957,whether you know her? Her family owns a large chain of apothe-
6958,"caries — and, of course, I hope very much that Miss Granger will"
6959,favor me by coming too.”
6960,Slughorn made Hermione a little bow as he finished speaking. It
6961,was as though Ron was not present; Slughorn did not so much as
6962,look at him.
6963,"“I can’t come, Professor,” said Harry at once. “I’ve got a deten-"
6964,tion with Professor Snape.”
6965,"“Oh dear!” said Slughorn, his face falling comically. “Dear, dear, I"
6966,"was counting on you, Harry! Well, now, I’ll just have to have a word"
6967,with Severus and explain the situation. I’m sure I’ll be able to per-
6968,"suade him to postpone your detention. Yes, I’ll see you both later!”"
6969,He bustled away out of the Hall.
6970,"“He’s got no chance of persuading Snape,” said Harry, the mo-"
6971,ment Slughorn was out of earshot. “This detention’s already been
6972,"postponed once; Snape did it for Dumbledore, but he won’t do it"
6973,for anyone else.”
6974,"“Oh, I wish you could come, I don’t want to go on my own!”"
6975,said Hermione anxiously; Harry knew that she was thinking about
6976,McLaggen.
6977, 233   
6978,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6979,"“I doubt you’ll be alone, Ginny’ll probably be invited,” snapped"
6980,"Ron, who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by"
6981,Slughorn.
6982,After dinner they made their way back to Gryffindor Tower. The
6983,"common room was very crowded, as most people had finished din-"
6984,"ner by now, but they managed to find a free table and sat down;"
6985,"Ron, who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with"
6986,"Slughorn, folded his arms and frowned at the ceiling. Hermione"
6987,"reached out for a copy of the Evening Prophet, which somebody"
6988,had left abandoned on a chair.
6989,“Anything new?” said Harry.
6990,“Not really . . .” Hermione had opened the newspaper and was
6991,"scanning the inside pages. “Oh, look, your dad’s in here, Ron —"
6992,"he’s all right!” she added quickly, for Ron had looked around in"
6993,alarm. “It just says he’s been to visit the Malfoys’ house. ‘This sec-
6994,ond search of the Death Eater’s residence does not seem to have yielded
6995,any results. Arthur Weasley of the Office for the Detection and Confis-
6996,cation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects said that
6997,his team had been acting upon a confidential tip-off.’ ”
6998,"“Yeah, mine!” said Harry. “I told him at King’s Cross about Mal-"
6999,"foy and that thing he was trying to get Borgin to fix! Well, if it’s not"
7000,"at their house, he must have brought whatever it is to Hogwarts"
7001,with him —”
7002,"“But how can he have done, Harry?” said Hermione, putting"
7003,down the newspaper with a surprised look. “We were all searched
7004,"when we arrived, weren’t we?”"
7005,"“Were you?” said Harry, taken aback. “I wasn’t!”"
7006,"“Oh no, of course you weren’t, I forgot you were late. . . . Well,"
7007,Filch ran over all of us with Secrecy Sensors when we got into the
7008, 234   

7010,HELPING HAND
7011,"entrance hall. Any Dark object would have been found, I know for"
7012,"a fact Crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated. So you see, Malfoy"
7013,can’t have brought in anything dangerous!”
7014,"Momentarily stymied, Harry watched Ginny Weasley playing"
7015,with Arnold the Pygmy Puff for a while before seeing a way around
7016,this objection.
7017,"“Someone’s sent it to him by owl, then,” he said. “His mother or"
7018,someone.”
7019,"“All the owls are being checked too,” said Hermione. “Filch told"
7020,us so when he was jabbing those Secrecy Sensors everywhere he
7021,could reach.”
7022,"Really stumped this time, Harry found nothing else to say."
7023,There did not seem to be any way Malfoy could have brought a
7024,dangerous or Dark object into the school. He looked hopefully at
7025,"Ron, who was sitting with his arms folded, staring over at Lavender"
7026,Brown.
7027,“Can you think of any way Malfoy — ?”
7028,"“Oh, drop it, Harry,” said Ron."
7029,"“Listen, it’s not my fault Slughorn invited Hermione and me to"
7030,"his stupid party, neither of us wanted to go, you know!” said Harry,"
7031,firing up.
7032,"“Well, as I’m not invited to any parties,” said Ron, getting to his"
7033,"feet again, “I think I’ll go to bed.”"
7034,"He stomped off toward the door to the boys’ dormitories, leav-"
7035,ing Harry and Hermione staring after him.
7036,"“Harry?” said the new Chaser, Demelza Robins, appearing sud-"
7037,denly at his shoulder. “I’ve got a message for you.”
7038,"“From Professor Slughorn?” asked Harry, sitting up hopefully."
7039,"“No . . . from Professor Snape,” said Demelza. Harry’s heart"
7040, 235 
7041,CHAPTER ELEVEN
7042,sank. “He says you’re to come to his office at half past eight tonight
7043,to do your detention — er — no matter how many party invita-
7044,tions you’ve received. And he wanted you to know you’ll be sorting
7045,"out rotten flobberworms from good ones, to use in Potions and —"
7046,and he says there’s no need to bring protective gloves.”
7047,"“Right,” said Harry grimly. “Thanks a lot, Demelza.”"

7050,SILVER AND OPALS
7051,"W          here was Dumbledore, and what was he doing? Harry"
7052,caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next
7053,"few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was"
7054,sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school
7055,for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was
7056,supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons
7057,were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt
7058,"bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned."
7059,Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to
7060,Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still
7061,"be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around"
7062,"the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it"
7063,was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.
7064,"Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving"
7065,"stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his"
7066,copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed
7067,  237  
7068,CHAPTER TWELVE
7069,"reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was"
7070,"indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that"
7071,"way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Prince’s copy of Ad-"
7072,vanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more
7073,"Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in"
7074,"there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that were"
7075,"earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the"
7076,"imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which"
7077,"Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the"
7078,Prince had invented himself.
7079,Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince’s self-invented
7080,spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarm-
7081,"ingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very en-"
7082,tertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the
7083,"mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an un-"
7084,"suspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato,"
7085,a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable
7086,"buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with-"
7087,out being overheard. The only person who did not find these
7088,"charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disap-"
7089,proving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry
7090,had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.
7091,"Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to ex-"
7092,amine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that
7093,seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many
7094,"crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of"
7095,"the page, the scribble:"
7096,Levicorpus (nvbl)
7097, 238  
7098,SILVER AND OPALS
7099,"While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows,"
7100,"and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets."
7101,Nvbl . . . that had to mean “nonverbal.” Harry rather doubted he
7102,would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having
7103,"difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick"
7104,"to comment on in every D.A.D.A. class. On the other hand, the"
7105,Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.
7106,"Pointing his wand at nothing in particular, he gave it an upward"
7107,flick and said Levicorpus! inside his head.
7108,“Aaaaaaaargh!”
7109,There was a flash of light and the room was full of voices: Every-
7110,one had woken up as Ron had let out a yell. Harry sent Advanced
7111,Potion-Making flying in panic; Ron was dangling upside down in
7112,midair as though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the
7113,ankle.
7114,"“Sorry!” yelled Harry, as Dean and Seamus roared with laughter,"
7115,"and Neville picked himself up from the floor, having fallen out of"
7116,bed. “Hang on — I’ll let you down —”
7117,"He groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic,"
7118,trying to find the right page; at last he located it and deciphered
7119,one cramped word underneath the spell: Praying that this was the
7120,"counter-jinx, Harry thought Liberacorpus! with all his might."
7121,"There was another flash of light, and Ron fell in a heap onto his"
7122,mattress.
7123,"“Sorry,” repeated Harry weakly, while Dean and Seamus contin-"
7124,ued to roar with laughter.
7125,"“Tomorrow,” said Ron in a muffled voice, “I’d rather you set the"
7126,alarm clock.”
7127,"By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with"
7128, 239  
7129,CHAPTER TWELVE
7130,several of Mrs. Weasley’s hand-knitted sweaters and carrying
7131,"cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron’s shock had subsided and he had"
7132,"decided that Harry’s new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in"
7133,"fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as"
7134,they sat down for breakfast.
7135,“. . . and then there was another flash of light and I landed on
7136,"the bed again!” Ron grinned, helping himself to sausages."
7137,"Hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote, and"
7138,now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon Harry.
7139,"“Was this spell, by any chance, another one from that potion"
7140,book of yours?” she asked.
7141,Harry frowned at her.
7142,"“Always jump to the worst conclusion, don’t you?”"
7143,“Was it?”
7144,"“Well . . . yeah, it was, but so what?”"
7145,"“So you just decided to try out an unknown, handwritten in-"
7146,cantation and see what would happen?”
7147,"“Why does it matter if it’s handwritten?” said Harry, preferring"
7148,not to answer the rest of the question.
7149,"“Because it’s probably not Ministry of Magic–approved,” said"
7150,"Hermione. “And also,” she added, as Harry and Ron rolled their"
7151,"eyes, “because I’m starting to think this Prince character was a bit"
7152,dodgy.”
7153,Both Harry and Ron shouted her down at once.
7154,"“It was a laugh!” said Ron, upending a ketchup bottle over his"
7155,"sausages. “Just a laugh, Hermione, that’s all!”"
7156,“Dangling people upside down by the ankle?” said Hermi-
7157,one. “Who puts their time and energy into making up spells like
7158,that?”
7159,  240  
7160,SILVER AND OPALS
7161,"“Fred and George,” said Ron, shrugging, “it’s their kind of thing."
7162,"And, er —”"
7163,"“My dad,” said Harry. He had only just remembered."
7164,“What?” said Ron and Hermione together.
7165,"“My dad used this spell,” said Harry. “I — Lupin told me.”"
7166,"This last part was not true; in fact, Harry had seen his father use"
7167,"the spell on Snape, but he had never told Ron and Hermione about"
7168,"that particular excursion into the Pensieve. Now, however, a won-"
7169,derful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince
7170,possibly be — ?
7171,"“Maybe your dad did use it, Harry,” said Hermione, “but he’s"
7172,"not the only one. We’ve seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case"
7173,you’ve forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float
7174,"along, asleep, helpless.”"
7175,"Harry stared at her. With a sinking feeling, he too remembered"
7176,the behavior of the Death Eaters at the Quidditch World Cup. Ron
7177,came to his aid.
7178,"“That was different,” he said robustly. “They were abusing it."
7179,Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don’t like the
7180,"Prince, Hermione,” he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly,"
7181,“because he’s better than you at Potions —”
7182,"“It’s got nothing to do with that!” said Hermione, her cheeks"
7183,reddening. “I just think it’s very irresponsible to start performing
7184,"spells when you don’t even know what they’re for, and stop talking"
7185,"about ‘the Prince’ as if it’s his title, I bet it’s just a stupid nickname,"
7186,and it doesn’t seem as though he was a very nice person to me!”
7187,"“I don’t see where you get that from,” said Harry heatedly. “If"
7188,he’d been a budding Death Eater he wouldn’t have been boasting
7189,"about being ‘half-blood,’ would he?”"
7190,  241    
7191,CHAPTER TWELVE
7192,"Even as he said it, Harry remembered that his father had been"
7193,"pure-blood, but he pushed the thought out of his mind; he would"
7194,worry about that later. . . .
7195,"“The Death Eaters can’t all be pure-blood, there aren’t enough"
7196,"pure-blood wizards left,” said Hermione stubbornly. “I expect most"
7197,of them are half-bloods pretending to be pure. It’s only Muggle-
7198,"borns they hate, they’d be quite happy to let you and Ron join up.”"
7199,“There is no way they’d let me be a Death Eater!” said Ron in-
7200,"dignantly, a bit of sausage flying off the fork he was now brandish-"
7201,ing at Hermione and hitting Ernie Macmillan on the head. “My
7202,whole family are blood traitors! That’s as bad as Muggle-borns to
7203,Death Eaters!”
7204,"“And they’d love to have me,” said Harry sarcastically. “We’d be"
7205,best pals if they didn’t keep trying to do me in.”
7206,"This made Ron laugh; even Hermione gave a grudging smile,"
7207,and a distraction arrived in the shape of Ginny.
7208,"“Hey, Harry, I’m supposed to give you this.”"
7209,It was a scroll of parchment with Harry’s name written upon it
7210,"in familiar thin, slanting writing."
7211,"“Thanks, Ginny . . . It’s Dumbledore’s next lesson!” Harry told"
7212,"Ron and Hermione, pulling open the parchment and quickly read-"
7213,ing its contents. “Monday evening!” He felt suddenly light and
7214,"happy. “Want to join us in Hogsmeade, Ginny?” he asked."
7215,"“I’m going with Dean — might see you there,” she replied, wav-"
7216,ing at them as she left.
7217,"Filch was standing at the oak front doors as usual, checking off"
7218,the names of people who had permission to go into Hogsmeade.
7219,The process took even longer than normal as Filch was triple-
7220,checking everybody with his Secrecy Sensor.
7221, 242   
7222,SILVER AND OPALS
7223,“What does it matter if we’re smuggling Dark stuff OUT?” de-
7224,"manded Ron, eyeing the long thin Secrecy Sensor with apprehen-"
7225,sion. “Surely you ought to be checking what we bring back IN?”
7226,"His cheek earned him a few extra jabs with the Sensor, and he"
7227,was still wincing as they stepped out into the wind and sleet.
7228,The walk into Hogsmeade was not enjoyable. Harry wrapped
7229,his scarf over his lower face; the exposed part soon felt both raw
7230,and numb. The road to the village was full of students bent double
7231,against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether
7232,"they might not have had a better time in the warm common room,"
7233,and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko’s
7234,"Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation"
7235,"that this trip was not destined to be fun. Ron pointed, with a"
7236,"thickly gloved hand, toward Honeydukes, which was mercifully"
7237,"open, and Harry and Hermione staggered in his wake into the"
7238,crowded shop.
7239,"“Thank God,” shivered Ron as they were enveloped by warm,"
7240,toffee-scented air. “Let’s stay here all afternoon.”
7241,"“Harry, m’boy!” said a booming voice from behind them."
7242,"“Oh no,” muttered Harry. The three of them turned to see Pro-"
7243,"fessor Slughorn, who was wearing an enormous furry hat and an"
7244,"overcoat with matching fur collar, clutching a large bag of crystal-"
7245,"ized pineapple, and occupying at least a quarter of the shop."
7246,"“Harry, that’s three of my little suppers you’ve missed now!” said"
7247,"Slughorn, poking him genially in the chest. “It won’t do, m’boy,"
7248,"I’m determined to have you! Miss Granger loves them, don’t you?”"
7249,"“Yes,” said Hermione helplessly, “they’re really —”"
7250,"“So why don’t you come along, Harry?” demanded Slughorn."
7251,"“Well, I’ve had Quidditch practice, Professor,” said Harry, who"
7252, 243   
7253,CHAPTER TWELVE
7254,had indeed been scheduling practices every time Slughorn had sent
7255,"him a little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation. This strategy meant"
7256,"that Ron was not left out, and they usually had a laugh with Ginny,"
7257,imagining Hermione shut up with McLaggen and Zabini.
7258,"“Well, I certainly expect you to win your first match after all this"
7259,hard work!” said Slughorn. “But a little recreation never hurt any-
7260,"body. Now, how about Monday night, you can’t possibly want to"
7261,practice in this weather. . . .”
7262,"“I can’t, Professor, I’ve got — er — an appointment with Profes-"
7263,sor Dumbledore that evening.”
7264,"“Unlucky again!” cried Slughorn dramatically. “Ah, well . . . you"
7265,"can’t evade me forever, Harry!”"
7266,"And with a regal wave, he waddled out of the shop, taking as lit-"
7267,tle notice of Ron as though he had been a display of Cockroach
7268,Clusters.
7269,"“I can’t believe you’ve wriggled out of another one,” said Hermi-"
7270,"one, shaking her head. “They’re not that bad, you know. . . . They’re"
7271,even quite fun sometimes. . . .” But then she caught sight of Ron’s
7272,"expression. “Oh, look — they’ve got deluxe sugar quills — those"
7273,would last hours!”
7274,"Glad that Hermione had changed the subject, Harry showed"
7275,much more interest in the new extra-large sugar quills than he
7276,"would normally have done, but Ron continued to look moody and"
7277,merely shrugged when Hermione asked him where he wanted to
7278,go next.
7279,"“Let’s go to the Three Broomsticks,” said Harry. “It’ll be warm.”"
7280,They bundled their scarves back over their faces and left the
7281,sweetshop. The bitter wind was like knives on their faces after the
7282,sugary warmth of Honeydukes. The street was not very busy; no-
7283, 244 
7284,SILVER AND OPALS
7285,"body was lingering to chat, just hurrying toward their destinations."
7286,"The exceptions were two men a little ahead of them, standing just"
7287,outside the Three Broomsticks. One was very tall and thin; squint-
7288,ing through his rain-washed glasses Harry recognized the barman
7289,"who worked in the other Hogsmeade pub, the Hog’s Head. As"
7290,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew closer, the barman drew his cloak"
7291,"more tightly around his neck and walked away, leaving the shorter"
7292,man to fumble with something in his arms. They were barely feet
7293,from him when Harry realized who the man was.
7294,“Mundungus!”
7295,"The squat, bandy-legged man with long, straggly, ginger hair"
7296,"jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase, which burst open, releas-"
7297,ing what looked like the entire contents of a junk shop window.
7298,"“Oh, ’ello, ’Arry,” said Mundungus Fletcher, with a most un-"
7299,"convincing stab at airiness. “Well, don’t let me keep ya.”"
7300,And he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the contents
7301,of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone.
7302,"“Are you selling this stuff?” asked Harry, watching Mundungus"
7303,grab an assortment of grubby-looking objects from the ground.
7304,"“Oh, well, gotta scrape a living,” said Mundungus. “Gimme"
7305,that!”
7306,Ron had stooped down and picked up something silver.
7307,"“Hang on,” Ron said slowly. “This looks familiar —”"
7308,"“Thank you!” said Mundungus, snatching the goblet out of"
7309,"Ron’s hand and stuffing it back into the case. “Well, I’ll see you"
7310,all — OUCH!”
7311,Harry had pinned Mundungus against the wall of the pub by
7312,"the throat. Holding him fast with one hand, he pulled out his"
7313,wand.
7314,  245  
7315,CHAPTER TWELVE
7316,“Harry!” squealed Hermione.
7317,"“You took that from Sirius’s house,” said Harry, who was almost"
7318,nose to nose with Mundungus and was breathing in an unpleasant
7319,smell of old tobacco and spirits. “That had the Black family crest
7320,on it.”
7321,"“I — no — what — ?” spluttered Mundungus, who was slowly"
7322,turning purple.
7323,"“What did you do, go back the night he died and strip the"
7324,place?” snarled Harry.
7325,“I — no —”
7326,“Give it to me!”
7327,"“Harry, you mustn’t!” shrieked Hermione, as Mundungus"
7328,started to turn blue.
7329,"There was a bang, and Harry felt his hands fly off Mundungus’s"
7330,"throat. Gasping and spluttering, Mundungus seized his fallen case,"
7331,then — CRACK — he Disapparated.
7332,"Harry swore at the top of his voice, spinning on the spot to see"
7333,where Mundungus had gone.
7334,"“COME BACK, YOU THIEVING — !”"
7335,"“There’s no point, Harry.”"
7336,"Tonks had appeared out of nowhere, her mousy hair wet with"
7337,sleet.
7338,“Mundungus will probably be in London by now. There’s no
7339,point yelling.”
7340,“He’s nicked Sirius’s stuff! Nicked it!”
7341,"“Yes, but still,” said Tonks, who seemed perfectly untroubled by"
7342,this piece of information. “You should get out of the cold.”
7343,She watched them go through the door of the Three Broom-
7344,sticks.
7345, 246  
7346,SILVER AND OPALS
7347,"The moment he was inside, Harry burst out, “He was nicking"
7348,Sirius’s stuff !”
7349,"“I know, Harry, but please don’t shout, people are staring,” whis-"
7350,"pered Hermione. “Go and sit down, I’ll get you a drink.”"
7351,Harry was still fuming when Hermione returned to their table a
7352,few minutes later holding three bottles of butterbeer.
7353,“Can’t the Order control Mundungus?” Harry demanded of the
7354,other two in a furious whisper. “Can’t they at least stop him steal-
7355,ing everything that’s not fixed down when he’s at headquarters?”
7356,"“Shh!” said Hermione desperately, looking around to make sure"
7357,nobody was listening; there were a couple of warlocks sitting close
7358,"by who were staring at Harry with great interest, and Zabini was"
7359,"lolling against a pillar not far away. “Harry, I’d be annoyed too, I"
7360,know it’s your things he’s stealing —”
7361,Harry gagged on his butterbeer; he had momentarily forgotten
7362,"that he owned number twelve, Grimmauld Place."
7363,"“Yeah, it’s my stuff!” he said. “No wonder he wasn’t pleased to"
7364,"see me! Well, I’m going to tell Dumbledore what’s going on, he’s"
7365,the only one who scares Mundungus.”
7366,"“Good idea,” whispered Hermione, clearly pleased that Harry"
7367,"was calming down. “Ron, what are you staring at?”"
7368,"“Nothing,” said Ron, hastily looking away from the bar, but Harry"
7369,knew he was trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive bar-
7370,"maid, Madam Rosmerta, for whom he had long nursed a soft spot."
7371,"“I expect ‘nothing’s’ in the back getting more firewhisky,” said"
7372,Hermione waspishly.
7373,"Ron ignored this jibe, sipping his drink in what he evidently"
7374,considered to be a dignified silence. Harry was thinking about Sir-
7375,"ius, and how he had hated those silver goblets anyway. Hermione"
7376,  247  
7377,CHAPTER TWELVE
7378,"drummed her fingers on the table, her eyes flickering between Ron"
7379,and the bar. The moment Harry drained the last drops in his bot-
7380,"tle she said, “Shall we call it a day and go back to school, then?”"
7381,The other two nodded; it had not been a fun trip and the
7382,weather was getting worse the longer they stayed. Once again they
7383,"drew their cloaks tightly around them, rearranged their scarves,"
7384,"pulled on their gloves, then followed Katie Bell and a friend out of"
7385,the pub and back up the High Street. Harry’s thoughts strayed to
7386,Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen
7387,"slush. They had not met up with her, undoubtedly, thought Harry,"
7388,because she and Dean were cozily closeted in Madam Puddifoot’s
7389,"Tea Shop, that haunt of happy couples. Scowling, he bowed his"
7390,head against the swirling sleet and trudged on.
7391,It was a little while before Harry became aware that the voices of
7392,"Katie Bell and her friend, which were being carried back to him on"
7393,"the wind, had become shriller and louder. Harry squinted at their"
7394,indistinct figures. The two girls were having an argument about
7395,something Katie was holding in her hand. “It’s nothing to do with
7396,"you, Leanne!” Harry heard Katie say."
7397,"They rounded a corner in the lane, sleet coming thick and fast,"
7398,blurring Harry’s glasses. Just as he raised a gloved hand to wipe
7399,"them, Leanne made to grab hold of the package Katie was holding;"
7400,Katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground.
7401,"At once, Katie rose into the air, not as Ron had done, suspended"
7402,"comically by the ankle, but gracefully, her arms outstretched, as"
7403,"though she was about to fly. Yet there was something wrong, some-"
7404,thing eerie. . . . Her hair was whipped around her by the fierce
7405,"wind, but her eyes were closed and her face was quite empty of"
7406, 248  
7407,SILVER AND OPALS
7408,"expression. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Leanne had all halted in"
7409,"their tracks, watching."
7410,"Then, six feet above the ground, Katie let out a terrible scream."
7411,"Her eyes flew open but whatever she could see, or whatever she was"
7412,"feeling, was clearly causing her terrible anguish. She screamed and"
7413,"screamed; Leanne started to scream too and seized Katie’s ankles,"
7414,"trying to tug her back to the ground. Harry, Ron, and Hermione"
7415,"rushed forward to help, but even as they grabbed Katie’s legs, she"
7416,fell on top of them; Harry and Ron managed to catch her but she
7417,was writhing so much they could hardly hold her. Instead they low-
7418,"ered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed, appar-"
7419,ently unable to recognize any of them.
7420,Harry looked around; the landscape seemed deserted.
7421,“Stay there!” he shouted at the others over the howling wind.
7422,“I’m going for help!”
7423,He began to sprint toward the school; he had never seen anyone
7424,behave as Katie had just behaved and could not think what had
7425,caused it; he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with
7426,what seemed to be an enormous bear on its hind legs.
7427,"“Hagrid!” he panted, disentangling himself from the hedgerow"
7428,into which he had fallen.
7429,"“Harry!” said Hagrid, who had sleet trapped in his eyebrows and"
7430,"beard, and was wearing his great, shaggy beaverskin coat. “Jus’ bin"
7431,"visitin’ Grawp, he’s comin’ on so well yeh wouldn’ —”"
7432,"“Hagrid, someone’s hurt back there, or cursed, or something —”"
7433,"“Wha?” said Hagrid, bending lower to hear what Harry was say-"
7434,ing over the raging wind.
7435,“Someone’s been cursed!” bellowed Harry.
7436, 249   
7437,CHAPTER TWELVE
7438,“Cursed? Who’s bin cursed — not Ron? Hermione?”
7439,"“No, it’s not them, it’s Katie Bell — this way . . .”"
7440,Together they ran back along the lane. It took them no time to
7441,"find the little group of people around Katie, who was still writhing"
7442,"and screaming on the ground; Ron, Hermione, and Leanne were"
7443,all trying to quiet her.
7444,“Get back!” shouted Hagrid. “Lemme see her!”
7445,“Something’s happened to her!” sobbed Leanne. “I don’t know
7446,what —”
7447,"Hagrid stared at Katie for a second, then without a word, bent"
7448,"down, scooped her into his arms, and ran off toward the castle with"
7449,"her. Within seconds, Katie’s piercing screams had died away and"
7450,the only sound was the roar of the wind.
7451,Hermione hurried over to Katie’s wailing friend and put an arm
7452,around her.
7453,"“It’s Leanne, isn’t it?”"
7454,The girl nodded.
7455,"“Did it just happen all of a sudden, or — ?”"
7456,"“It was when that package tore,” sobbed Leanne, pointing at the"
7457,"now sodden brown-paper package on the ground, which had split"
7458,"open to reveal a greenish glitter. Ron bent down, his hand out-"
7459,"stretched, but Harry seized his arm and pulled him back."
7460,“Don’t touch it!”
7461,"He crouched down. An ornate opal necklace was visible, poking"
7462,out of the paper.
7463,"“I’ve seen that before,” said Harry, staring at the thing. “It was"
7464,on display in Borgin and Burkes ages ago. The label said it was
7465,"cursed. Katie must have touched it.” He looked up at Leanne, who"
7466, 250   
7467,SILVER AND OPALS
7468,had started to shake uncontrollably. “How did Katie get hold of
7469,this?”
7470,"“Well, that’s why we were arguing. She came back from the"
7471,"bathroom in the Three Broomsticks holding it, said it was a sur-"
7472,prise for somebody at Hogwarts and she had to deliver it. She
7473,"looked all funny when she said it. . . . Oh no, oh no, I bet she’d"
7474,been Imperiused and I didn’t realize!”
7475,Leanne shook with renewed sobs. Hermione patted her shoulder
7476,gently.
7477,"“She didn’t say who’d given it to her, Leanne?”"
7478,“No . . . she wouldn’t tell me . . . and I said she was being stupid
7479,"and not to take it up to school, but she just wouldn’t listen and . . ."
7480,and then I tried to grab it from her . . . and — and —”
7481,Leanne let out a wail of despair.
7482,"“We’d better get up to school,” said Hermione, her arm still"
7483,around Leanne. “We’ll be able to find out how she is. Come on. . . .”
7484,"Harry hesitated for a moment, then pulled his scarf from around"
7485,"his face and, ignoring Ron’s gasp, carefully covered the necklace in"
7486,it and picked it up.
7487,"“We’ll need to show this to Madam Pomfrey,” he said."
7488,"As they followed Hermione and Leanne up the road, Harry was"
7489,thinking furiously. They had just entered the grounds when he
7490,"spoke, unable to keep his thoughts to himself any longer."
7491,“Malfoy knows about this necklace. It was in a case at Borgin and
7492,"Burkes four years ago, I saw him having a good look at it while I was"
7493,hiding from him and his dad. This is what he was buying that day
7494,when we followed him! He remembered it and he went back for it!”
7495,"“I — I dunno, Harry,” said Ron hesitantly. “Loads of people go"
7496, 251    
7497,CHAPTER TWELVE
7498,to Borgin and Burkes . . . and didn’t that girl say Katie got it in the
7499,girls’ bathroom?”
7500,"“She said she came back from the bathroom with it, she didn’t"
7501,necessarily get it in the bathroom itself —”
7502,“McGonagall!” said Ron warningly.
7503,"Harry looked up. Sure enough, Professor McGonagall was hur-"
7504,rying down the stone steps through swirling sleet to meet them.
7505,“Hagrid says you four saw what happened to Katie Bell —
7506,"upstairs to my office at once, please! What’s that you’re holding,"
7507,Potter?”
7508,"“It’s the thing she touched,” said Harry."
7509,"“Good lord,” said Professor McGonagall, looking alarmed as she"
7510,"took the necklace from Harry. “No, no, Filch, they’re with me!” she"
7511,"added hastily, as Filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance"
7512,hall holding his Secrecy Sensor aloft. “Take this necklace to Profes-
7513,"sor Snape at once, but be sure not to touch it, keep it wrapped in"
7514,the scarf!”
7515,Harry and the others followed Professor McGonagall upstairs
7516,and into her office. The sleet-spattered windows were rattling in
7517,"their frames, and the room was chilly despite the fire crackling in"
7518,the grate. Professor McGonagall closed the door and swept around
7519,"her desk to face Harry, Ron, Hermione, and the still sobbing"
7520,Leanne.
7521,“Well?” she said sharply. “What happened?”
7522,"Haltingly, and with many pauses while she attempted to control"
7523,"her crying, Leanne told Professor McGonagall how Katie had gone"
7524,to the bathroom in the Three Broomsticks and returned holding
7525,"the unmarked package, how Katie had seemed a little odd, and"
7526, 252  
7527,SILVER AND OPALS
7528,how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver
7529,"unknown objects, the argument culminating in the tussle over the"
7530,"parcel, which tore open. At this point, Leanne was so overcome,"
7531,there was no getting another word out of her.
7532,"“All right,” said Professor McGonagall, not unkindly, “go up to"
7533,"the hospital wing, please, Leanne, and get Madam Pomfrey to give"
7534,you something for shock.”
7535,"When she had left the room, Professor McGonagall turned back"
7536,"to Harry, Ron, and Hermione."
7537,“What happened when Katie touched the necklace?”
7538,"“She rose up in the air,” said Harry, before either Ron or Hermi-"
7539,"one could speak, “and then began to scream, and collapsed. Profes-"
7540,"sor, can I see Professor Dumbledore, please?”"
7541,"“The headmaster is away until Monday, Potter,” said Professor"
7542,"McGonagall, looking surprised."
7543,“Away?” Harry repeated angrily.
7544,"“Yes, Potter, away!” said Professor McGonagall tartly. “But any-"
7545,thing you have to say about this horrible business can be said to
7546,"me, I’m sure!”"
7547,"For a split second, Harry hesitated. Professor McGonagall did"
7548,"not invite confidences; Dumbledore, though in many ways more"
7549,"intimidating, still seemed less likely to scorn a theory, however"
7550,"wild. This was a life-and-death matter, though, and no moment to"
7551,worry about being laughed at.
7552,"“I think Draco Malfoy gave Katie that necklace, Professor.”"
7553,"On one side of him, Ron rubbed his nose in apparent embar-"
7554,"rassment; on the other, Hermione shuffled her feet as though quite"
7555,keen to put a bit of distance between herself and Harry.
7556, 253  
7557,CHAPTER TWELVE
7558,"“That is a very serious accusation, Potter,” said Professor McGon-"
7559,"agall, after a shocked pause. “Do you have any proof?”"
7560,"“No,” said Harry, “but . . .” and he told her about following"
7561,Malfoy to Borgin and Burkes and the conversation they had over-
7562,heard between him and Mr. Borgin.
7563,"When he had finished speaking, Professor McGonagall looked"
7564,slightly confused.
7565,“Malfoy took something to Borgin and Burkes for repair?”
7566,"“No, Professor, he just wanted Borgin to tell him how to mend"
7567,"something, he didn’t have it with him. But that’s not the point, the"
7568,"thing is that he bought something at the same time, and I think it"
7569,was that necklace —”
7570,“You saw Malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package?”
7571,"“No, Professor, he told Borgin to keep it in the shop for him —”"
7572,"“But Harry,” Hermione interrupted, “Borgin asked him if he"
7573,"wanted to take it with him, and Malfoy said no —”"
7574,"“Because he didn’t want to touch it, obviously!” said Harry"
7575,angrily.
7576,"“What he actually said was, ‘How would I look carrying that"
7577,down the street?’ ” said Hermione.
7578,"“Well, he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace,” inter-"
7579,jected Ron.
7580,"“Oh, Ron,” said Hermione despairingly, “it would be all"
7581,"wrapped up, so he wouldn’t have to touch it, and quite easy to hide"
7582,"inside a cloak, so nobody would see it! I think whatever he reserved"
7583,"at Borgin and Burkes was noisy or bulky, something he knew"
7584,would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street — and
7585,"in any case,” she pressed on loudly, before Harry could interrupt,"
7586,"“I asked Borgin about the necklace, don’t you remember? When I"
7587, 254   
7588,SILVER AND OPALS
7589,"went in to try and find out what Malfoy had asked him to keep, I"
7590,"saw it there. And Borgin just told me the price, he didn’t say it was"
7591,already sold or anything —”
7592,"“Well, you were being really obvious, he realized what you were"
7593,"up to within about five seconds, of course he wasn’t going to tell"
7594,"you — anyway, Malfoy could’ve sent off for it since —”"
7595,"“That’s enough!” said Professor McGonagall, as Hermione"
7596,"opened her mouth to retort, looking furious. “Potter, I appreciate"
7597,"you telling me this, but we cannot point the finger of blame at Mr."
7598,Malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace
7599,might have been purchased. The same is probably true of hundreds
7600,of people —”
7601,“— that’s what I said —” muttered Ron.
7602,"“— and in any case, we have put stringent security measures in"
7603,place this year. I do not believe that necklace can possibly have en-
7604,tered this school without our knowledge —”
7605,“But —”
7606,"“— and what is more,” said Professor McGonagall, with an air"
7607,"of awful finality, “Mr. Malfoy was not in Hogsmeade today.”"
7608,"Harry gaped at her, deflating."
7609,"“How do you know, Professor?”"
7610,“Because he was doing detention with me. He has now failed to
7611,"complete his Transfiguration homework twice in a row. So, thank"
7612,"you for telling me your suspicions, Potter,” she said as she marched"
7613,"past them, “but I need to go up to the hospital wing now to check"
7614,on Katie Bell. Good day to you all.”
7615,She held open her office door. They had no choice but to file
7616,past her without another word.
7617,Harry was angry with the other two for siding with McGonagall;
7618, 255   
7619,CHAPTER TWELVE
7620,"nevertheless, he felt compelled to join in once they started dis-"
7621,cussing what had happened.
7622,“So who do you reckon Katie was supposed to give the necklace
7623,"to?” asked Ron, as they climbed the stairs to the common room."
7624,"“Goodness only knows,” said Hermione. “But whoever it was"
7625,has had a narrow escape. No one could have opened that package
7626,without touching the necklace.”
7627,"“It could’ve been meant for loads of people,” said Harry. “Dum-"
7628,"bledore — the Death Eaters would love to get rid of him, he must"
7629,be one of their top targets. Or Slughorn — Dumbledore reckons
7630,Voldemort really wanted him and they can’t be pleased that he’s
7631,sided with Dumbledore. Or —”
7632,"“Or you,” said Hermione, looking troubled."
7633,"“Couldn’t have been,” said Harry, “or Katie would’ve just turned"
7634,"around in the lane and given it to me, wouldn’t she? I was behind"
7635,her all the way out of the Three Broomsticks. It would have made
7636,"much more sense to deliver the parcel outside Hogwarts, what with"
7637,Filch searching everyone who goes in and out. I wonder why Mal-
7638,foy told her to take it into the castle?”
7639,"“Harry, Malfoy wasn’t in Hogsmeade!” said Hermione, actually"
7640,stamping her foot in frustration.
7641,"“He must have used an accomplice, then,” said Harry. “Crabbe"
7642,"or Goyle — or, come to think of it, another Death Eater, he’ll have"
7643,loads better cronies than Crabbe and Goyle now he’s joined up —”
7644,Ron and Hermione exchanged looks that plainly said There’s no
7645,point arguing with him.
7646,"“Dilligrout,” said Hermione firmly as they reached the Fat Lady."
7647,The portrait swung open to admit them to the common room.
7648,It was quite full and smelled of damp clothing; many people
7649,  256   
7650,SILVER AND OPALS
7651,seemed to have returned from Hogsmeade early because of the bad
7652,"weather. There was no buzz of fear or speculation, however:"
7653,"Clearly, the news of Katie’s fate had not yet spread."
7654,"“It wasn’t a very slick attack, really, when you stop and think"
7655,"about it,” said Ron, casually turfing a first year out of one of the"
7656,good armchairs by the fire so that he could sit down. “The curse
7657,didn’t even make it into the castle. Not what you’d call foolproof.”
7658,"“You’re right,” said Hermione, prodding Ron out of the chair"
7659,with her foot and offering it to the first year again. “It wasn’t very
7660,well thought-out at all.”
7661,“But since when has Malfoy been one of the world’s great
7662,thinkers?” asked Harry.
7663,Neither Ron nor Hermione answered him.

7666,THE SECRET RIDDLE
7667,K       atie was removed to St. Mungo’s Hospital for Magical
7668,"Maladies and Injuries the following day, by which time the"
7669,"news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school,"
7670,"though the details were confused and nobody other than Harry,"
7671,"Ron, Hermione, and Leanne seemed to know that Katie herself"
7672,had not been the intended target.
7673,"“Oh, and Malfoy knows, of course,” said Harry to Ron and Her-"

7675,ever Harry mentioned his Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater theory.
7676,Harry had wondered whether Dumbledore would return from
7677,"wherever he had been in time for Monday night’s lesson, but hav-"
7678,"ing had no word to the contrary, he presented himself outside"
7679,"Dumbledore’s office at eight o’clock, knocked, and was told to en-"

7684,"to sit down. The Pensieve was sitting on the desk again, casting sil-"
7685,very specks of light over the ceiling.
7686,"“You have had a busy time while I have been away,” Dumble-"
7687,dore said. “I believe you witnessed Katie’s accident.”
7688,"“Yes, sir. How is she?”"
7689,"“Still very unwell, although she was relatively lucky. She appears"
7690,to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of
7691,"skin: There was a tiny hole in her glove. Had she put it on, had she"
7692,"even held it in her ungloved hand, she would have died, perhaps"
7693,instantly. Luckily Professor Snape was able to do enough to prevent
7694,a rapid spread of the curse —”
7695,“Why him?” asked Harry quickly. “Why not Madam Pomfrey?”
7696,"“Impertinent,” said a soft voice from one of the portraits on the"
7697,"wall, and Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-grandfather,"
7698,raised his head from his arms where he had appeared to be sleeping.
7699,“I would not have permitted a student to question the way Hog-
7700,warts operated in my day.”
7701,"“Yes, thank you, Phineas,” said Dumbledore quellingly. “Profes-"
7702,sor Snape knows much more about the Dark Arts than Madam
7703,"Pomfrey, Harry. Anyway, the St. Mungo’s staff are sending me"
7704,"hourly reports, and I am hopeful that Katie will make a full recov-"
7705,ery in time.”
7706,"“Where were you this weekend, sir?” Harry asked, disregarding"
7707,"a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck, a feeling appar-"
7708,"ently shared by Phineas Nigellus, who hissed softly."
7709,"“I would rather not say just now,” said Dumbledore. “However,"
7710,I shall tell you in due course.”
7711,"“You will?” said Harry, startled."
7712, 259   
7713,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7714,"“Yes, I expect so,” said Dumbledore, withdrawing a fresh bottle"
7715,of silver memories from inside his robes and uncorking it with a
7716,prod of his wand.
7717,"“Sir,” said Harry tentatively, “I met Mundungus in Hogsmeade.”"
7718,"“Ah yes, I am already aware that Mundungus has been treating"
7719,"your inheritance with light-fingered contempt,” said Dumbledore,"
7720,frowning a little. “He has gone to ground since you accosted him
7721,outside the Three Broomsticks; I rather think he dreads facing me.
7722,"However, rest assured that he will not be making away with any"
7723,more of Sirius’s old possessions.”
7724,“That mangy old half-blood has been stealing Black heirlooms?”
7725,"said Phineas Nigellus, incensed; and he stalked out of his frame,"
7726,"undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve, Grimmauld"
7727,Place.
7728,"“Professor,” said Harry, after a short pause, “did Professor"
7729,McGonagall tell you what I told her after Katie got hurt? About
7730,Draco Malfoy?”
7731,"“She told me of your suspicions, yes,” said Dumbledore."
7732,“And do you — ?”
7733,“I shall take all appropriate measures to investigate anyone who
7734,"might have had a hand in Katie’s accident,” said Dumbledore. “But"
7735,"what concerns me now, Harry, is our lesson.”"
7736,Harry felt slightly resentful at this: If their lessons were so very
7737,"important, why had there been such a long gap between the first"
7738,"and second? However, he said no more about Draco Malfoy, but"
7739,watched as Dumbledore poured the fresh memories into the Pen-
7740,sieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his
7741,long-fingered hands.
7742,"“You will remember, I am sure, that we left the tale of Lord"

7744,THE SECRET RIDDLE
7745,"Voldemort’s beginnings at the point where the handsome Muggle,"
7746,"Tom Riddle, had abandoned his witch wife, Merope, and returned"
7747,to his family home in Little Hangleton. Merope was left alone in
7748,"London, expecting the baby who would one day become Lord"
7749,Voldemort.”
7750,"“How do you know she was in London, sir?”"
7751,"“Because of the evidence of one Caractacus Burke,” said Dum-"
7752,"bledore, “who, by an odd coincidence, helped found the very shop"
7753,whence came the necklace we have just been discussing.”
7754,He swilled the contents of the Pensieve as Harry had seen him
7755,"swill them before, much as a gold prospector sifts for gold. Up out"
7756,"of the swirling, silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in"
7757,"the Pensieve, silver as a ghost but much more solid, with a thatch"
7758,of hair that completely covered his eyes.
7759,"“Yes, we acquired it in curious circumstances. It was brought in"
7760,"by a young witch just before Christmas, oh, many years ago now."
7761,"She said she needed the gold badly, well, that much was obvious."
7762,"Covered in rags and pretty far along . . . Going to have a baby, see."
7763,"She said the locket had been Slytherin’s. Well, we hear that sort of"
7764,"story all the time, ‘Oh, this was Merlin’s, this was, his favorite"
7765,"teapot,’ but when I looked at it, it had his mark all right, and a few"
7766,"simple spells were enough to tell me the truth. Of course, that"
7767,made it near enough priceless. She didn’t seem to have any idea
7768,how much it was worth. Happy to get ten Galleons for it. Best bar-
7769,gain we ever made!”
7770,Dumbledore gave the Pensieve an extra-vigorous shake and Car-
7771,actacus Burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory
7772,from whence he had come.
7773,“He only gave her ten Galleons?” said Harry indignantly.
7774, 261    
7775,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7776,"“Caractacus Burke was not famed for his generosity,” said Dum-"
7777,"bledore. “So we know that, near the end of her pregnancy, Merope"
7778,"was alone in London and in desperate need of gold, desperate"
7779,"enough to sell her one and only valuable possession, the locket that"
7780,was one of Marvolo’s treasured family heirlooms.”
7781,“But she could do magic!” said Harry impatiently. “She could
7782,"have got food and everything for herself by magic, couldn’t she?”"
7783,"“Ah,” said Dumbledore, “perhaps she could. But it is my"
7784,"belief — I am guessing again, but I am sure I am right — that"
7785,"when her husband abandoned her, Merope stopped using magic. I"
7786,"do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer. Of course,"
7787,it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair
7788,"sapped her of her powers; that can happen. In any case, as you are"
7789,"about to see, Merope refused to raise her wand even to save her"
7790,own life.”
7791,“She wouldn’t even stay alive for her son?”
7792,Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “Could you possibly be feeling
7793,sorry for Lord Voldemort?”
7794,"“No,” said Harry quickly, “but she had a choice, didn’t she, not"
7795,like my mother —”
7796,"“Your mother had a choice too,” said Dumbledore gently. “Yes,"
7797,"Merope Riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her, but"
7798,"do not judge her too harshly, Harry. She was greatly weakened by"
7799,"long suffering and she never had your mother’s courage. And now,"
7800,if you will stand . . .”
7801,"“Where are we going?” Harry asked, as Dumbledore joined him"
7802,at the front of the desk.
7803,"“This time,” said Dumbledore, “we are going to enter my"
7804, 262  
7805,THE SECRET RIDDLE
7806,memory. I think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly
7807,"accurate. After you, Harry . . .”"
7808,Harry bent over the Pensieve; his face broke the cool surface of
7809,the memory and then he was falling through darkness again. . . .
7810,"Seconds later, his feet hit firm ground; he opened his eyes and"
7811,"found that he and Dumbledore were standing in a bustling, old-"
7812,fashioned London street.
7813,"“There I am,” said Dumbledore brightly, pointing ahead of"
7814,them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horse-drawn
7815,milk cart.
7816,This younger Albus Dumbledore’s long hair and beard were
7817,"auburn. Having reached their side of the street, he strode off along"
7818,"the pavement, drawing many curious glances due to the flamboy-"
7819,antly cut suit of plum velvet that he was wearing.
7820,"“Nice suit, sir,” said Harry, before he could stop himself, but"
7821,Dumbledore merely chuckled as they followed his younger self a
7822,"short distance, finally passing through a set of iron gates into a bare"
7823,"courtyard that fronted a rather grim, square building surrounded"
7824,by high railings. He mounted the few steps leading to the front
7825,"door and knocked once. After a moment or two, the door was"
7826,opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron.
7827,"“Good afternoon. I have an appointment with a Mrs. Cole,"
7828,"who, I believe, is the matron here?”"
7829,"“Oh,” said the bewildered-looking girl, taking in Dumbledore’s"
7830,eccentric appearance. “Um . . . just a mo’ . . . MRS. COLE!” she
7831,bellowed over her shoulder.
7832,Harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response.
7833,"The girl turned back to Dumbledore. “Come in, she’s on ’er way.”"
7834,  263 
7835,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7836,Dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white; the
7837,whole place was shabby but spotlessly clean. Harry and the older
7838,Dumbledore followed. Before the front door had closed behind
7839,"them, a skinny, harassed-looking woman came scurrying toward"
7840,them. She had a sharp-featured face that appeared more anxious
7841,"than unkind, and she was talking over her shoulder to another"
7842,aproned helper as she walked toward Dumbledore.
7843,"“. . . and take the iodine upstairs to Martha, Billy Stubbs has"
7844,been picking his scabs and Eric Whalley’s oozing all over his

7847,"she stopped dead in her tracks, looking as astonished as if a giraffe"
7848,had just crossed her threshold.
7849,"“Good afternoon,” said Dumbledore, holding out his hand."
7850,Mrs. Cole simply gaped.
7851,“My name is Albus Dumbledore. I sent you a letter requesting
7852,an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today.”
7853,Mrs. Cole blinked. Apparently deciding that Dumbledore was
7854,"not a hallucination, she said feebly, “Oh yes. Well — well then —"
7855,you’d better come into my room. Yes.”
7856,She led Dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting
7857,"room, part office. It was as shabby as the hallway and the furniture"
7858,was old and mismatched. She invited Dumbledore to sit on a rick-
7859,"ety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk, eyeing him"
7860,nervously.
7861,"“I am here, as I told you in my letter, to discuss Tom Riddle and"
7862,"arrangements for his future,” said Dumbledore."
7863,“Are you family?” asked Mrs. Cole.
7864, 264  
7865,THE SECRET RIDDLE
7866,"“No, I am a teacher,” said Dumbledore. “I have come to offer"
7867,Tom a place at my school.”
7868,"“What school’s this, then?”"
7869,"“It is called Hogwarts,” said Dumbledore."
7870,“And how come you’re interested in Tom?”
7871,“We believe he has qualities we are looking for.”
7872,“You mean he’s won a scholarship? How can he have done? He’s
7873,never been entered for one.”
7874,"“Well, his name has been down for our school since birth —”"
7875,“Who registered him? His parents?”
7876,There was no doubt that Mrs. Cole was an inconveniently sharp
7877,"woman. Apparently Dumbledore thought so too, for Harry now"
7878,"saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit, at the"
7879,same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from Mrs.
7880,Cole’s desktop.
7881,"“Here,” said Dumbledore, waving his wand once as he passed"
7882,"her the piece of paper, “I think this will make everything clear.”"
7883,Mrs. Cole’s eyes slid out of focus and back again as she gazed in-
7884,tently at the blank paper for a moment.
7885,"“That seems perfectly in order,” she said placidly, handing it"
7886,back. Then her eyes fell upon a bottle of gin and two glasses that
7887,had certainly not been present a few seconds before.
7888,“Er — may I offer you a glass of gin?” she said in an extra-
7889,refined voice.
7890,"“Thank you very much,” said Dumbledore, beaming."
7891,It soon became clear that Mrs. Cole was no novice when it came
7892,"to gin drinking. Pouring both of them a generous measure, she"
7893,"drained her own glass in one gulp. Smacking her lips frankly, she"
7894, 265  
7895,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7896,"smiled at Dumbledore for the first time, and he didn’t hesitate to"
7897,press his advantage.
7898,“I was wondering whether you could tell me anything of Tom
7899,Riddle’s history? I think he was born here in the orphanage?”
7900,"“That’s right,” said Mrs. Cole, helping herself to more gin. “I re-"
7901,"member it clear as anything, because I’d just started here myself."
7902,"New Year’s Eve and bitter cold, snowing, you know. Nasty night."
7903,"And this girl, not much older than I was myself at the time, came"
7904,"staggering up the front steps. Well, she wasn’t the first. We took her"
7905,"in, and she had the baby within the hour. And she was dead in an-"
7906,other hour.”
7907,Mrs. Cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp
7908,of gin.
7909,“Did she say anything before she died?” asked Dumbledore.
7910,"“Anything about the boy’s father, for instance?”"
7911,"“Now, as it happens, she did,” said Mrs. Cole, who seemed to be"
7912,"rather enjoying herself now, with the gin in her hand and an eager"
7913,"audience for her story. “I remember she said to me, ‘I hope he looks"
7914,"like his papa,’ and I won’t lie, she was right to hope it, because she"
7915,"was no beauty — and then she told me he was to be named Tom,"
7916,"for his father, and Marvolo, for her father — yes, I know, funny"
7917,"name, isn’t it? We wondered whether she came from a circus —"
7918,and she said the boy’s surname was to be Riddle. And she died soon
7919,after that without another word.
7920,"“Well, we named him just as she’d said, it seemed so important"
7921,"to the poor girl, but no Tom nor Marvolo nor any kind of Riddle"
7922,"ever came looking for him, nor any family at all, so he stayed in the"
7923,orphanage and he’s been here ever since.”
7924,"Mrs. Cole helped herself, almost absentmindedly, to another"
7925,  266 
7926,THE SECRET RIDDLE
7927,healthy measure of gin. Two pink spots had appeared high on her
7928,"cheekbones. Then she said, “He’s a funny boy.”"
7929,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I thought he might be.”"
7930,"“He was a funny baby too. He hardly ever cried, you know. And"
7931,"then, when he got a little older, he was . . . odd.”"
7932,“Odd in what way?” asked Dumbledore gently.
7933,"“Well, he —”"
7934,"But Mrs. Cole pulled up short, and there was nothing blurry or"
7935,vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot Dumbledore over her
7936,gin glass.
7937,"“He’s definitely got a place at your school, you say?”"
7938,"“Definitely,” said Dumbledore."
7939,“And nothing I say can change that?”
7940,"“Nothing,” said Dumbledore."
7941,"“You’ll be taking him away, whatever?”"
7942,"“Whatever,” repeated Dumbledore gravely."
7943,She squinted at him as though deciding whether or not to trust
7944,"him. Apparently she decided she could, because she said in a sud-"
7945,"den rush, “He scares the other children.”"
7946,“You mean he is a bully?” asked Dumbledore.
7947,"“I think he must be,” said Mrs. Cole, frowning slightly, “but it’s"
7948,very hard to catch him at it. There have been incidents. . . . Nasty
7949,things . . .”
7950,"Dumbledore did not press her, though Harry could tell that he"
7951,was interested. She took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy
7952,cheeks grew rosier still.
7953,"“Billy Stubbs’s rabbit . . . well, Tom said he didn’t do it and I"
7954,"don’t see how he could have done, but even so, it didn’t hang itself"
7955,"from the rafters, did it?”"
7956, 267   
7957,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7958,"“I shouldn’t think so, no,” said Dumbledore quietly."
7959,“But I’m jiggered if I know how he got up there to do it. All I
7960,know is he and Billy had argued the day before. And then” — Mrs.
7961,"Cole took another swig of gin, slopping a little over her chin this"
7962,"time — “on the summer outing — we take them out, you know,"
7963,"once a year, to the countryside or to the seaside — well, Amy Ben-"
7964,"son and Dennis Bishop were never quite right afterwards, and all"
7965,we ever got out of them was that they’d gone into a cave with Tom
7966,"Riddle. He swore they’d just gone exploring, but something hap-"
7967,"pened in there, I’m sure of it. And, well, there have been a lot of"
7968,"things, funny things. . . .”"
7969,"She looked around at Dumbledore again, and though her cheeks"
7970,"were flushed, her gaze was steady. “I don’t think many people will"
7971,be sorry to see the back of him.”
7972,"“You understand, I’m sure, that we will not be keeping him per-"
7973,"manently?” said Dumbledore. “He will have to return here, at the"
7974,"very least, every summer.”"
7975,"“Oh, well, that’s better than a whack on the nose with a rusty"
7976,"poker,” said Mrs. Cole with a slight hiccup. She got to her feet, and"
7977,"Harry was impressed to see that she was quite steady, even though"
7978,two-thirds of the gin was now gone. “I suppose you’d like to see
7979,him?”
7980,"“Very much,” said Dumbledore, rising too."
7981,"She led him out of her office and up the stone stairs, calling out"
7982,instructions and admonitions to helpers and children as she passed.
7983,"The orphans, Harry saw, were all wearing the same kind of grayish"
7984,"tunic. They looked reasonably well-cared for, but there was no"
7985,denying that this was a grim place in which to grow up.
7986,"“Here we are,” said Mrs. Cole, as they turned off the second"

7988,THE SECRET RIDDLE
7989,landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor. She
7990,knocked twice and entered.
7991,"“Tom? You’ve got a visitor. This is Mr. Dumberton — sorry,"
7992,"Dunderbore. He’s come to tell you — well, I’ll let him do it.”"
7993,"Harry and the two Dumbledores entered the room, and Mrs."
7994,Cole closed the door on them. It was a small bare room with noth-
7995,"ing in it except an old wardrobe, a wooden chair, and an iron bed-"
7996,"stead. A boy was sitting on top of the gray blankets, his legs"
7997,"stretched out in front of him, holding a book."
7998,There was no trace of the Gaunts in Tom Riddle’s face. Merope
7999,"had got her dying wish: He was his handsome father in miniature,"
8000,"tall for eleven years old, dark-haired, and pale. His eyes narrowed"
8001,slightly as he took in Dumbledore’s eccentric appearance. There
8002,was a moment’s silence.
8003,"“How do you do, Tom?” said Dumbledore, walking forward and"
8004,holding out his hand.
8005,"The boy hesitated, then took it, and they shook hands. Dum-"
8006,"bledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside Riddle, so that the"
8007,pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor.
8008,“I am Professor Dumbledore.”
8009,“ ‘Professor’?” repeated Riddle. He looked wary. “Is that like
8010,‘doctor’? What are you here for? Did she get you in to have a look
8011,at me?”
8012,He was pointing at the door through which Mrs. Cole had just
8013,left.
8014,"“No, no,” said Dumbledore, smiling."
8015,"“I don’t believe you,” said Riddle. “She wants me looked at,"
8016,doesn’t she? Tell the truth!”
8017,He spoke the last three words with a ringing force that was
8018, 269  
8019,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
8020,"almost shocking. It was a command, and it sounded as though he"
8021,had given it many times before. His eyes had widened and he was
8022,"glaring at Dumbledore, who made no response except to continue"
8023,"smiling pleasantly. After a few seconds Riddle stopped glaring,"
8024,"though he looked, if anything, warier still."
8025,“Who are you?”
8026,“I have told you. My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work
8027,at a school called Hogwarts. I have come to offer you a place at my
8028,"school — your new school, if you would like to come.”"
8029,Riddle’s reaction to this was most surprising. He leapt from the
8030,"bed and backed away from Dumbledore, looking furious."
8031,"“You can’t kid me! The asylum, that’s where you’re from, isn’t it?"
8032,"‘Professor,’ yes, of course — well, I’m not going, see? That old cat’s"
8033,the one who should be in the asylum. I never did anything to little
8034,"Amy Benson or Dennis Bishop, and you can ask them, they’ll tell"
8035,you!”
8036,"“I am not from the asylum,” said Dumbledore patiently. “I am a"
8037,"teacher and, if you will sit down calmly, I shall tell you about Hog-"
8038,"warts. Of course, if you would rather not come to the school, no-"
8039,body will force you —”
8040,"“I’d like to see them try,” sneered Riddle."
8041,"“Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, as though he had not heard"
8042,"Riddle’s last words, “is a school for people with special abilities —”"
8043,“I’m not mad!”
8044,“I know that you are not mad. Hogwarts is not a school for mad
8045,people. It is a school of magic.”
8046,"There was silence. Riddle had frozen, his face expressionless, but"
8047,his eyes were flickering back and forth between each of Dumble-
8048,"dore’s, as though trying to catch one of them lying."
8049, 270   
8050,THE SECRET RIDDLE
8051,“Magic?” he repeated in a whisper.
8052,"“That’s right,” said Dumbledore."
8053,"“It’s . . . it’s magic, what I can do?”"
8054,“What is it that you can do?”
8055,"“All sorts,” breathed Riddle. A flush of excitement was rising up"
8056,his neck into his hollow cheeks; he looked fevered. “I can make
8057,things move without touching them. I can make animals do what
8058,"I want them to do, without training them. I can make bad things"
8059,happen to people who annoy me. I can make them hurt if I want
8060,to.”
8061,His legs were trembling. He stumbled forward and sat down on
8062,"the bed again, staring at his hands, his head bowed as though in"
8063,prayer.
8064,"“I knew I was different,” he whispered to his own quivering fin-"
8065,"gers. “I knew I was special. Always, I knew there was something.”"
8066,"“Well, you were quite right,” said Dumbledore, who was no"
8067,"longer smiling, but watching Riddle intently. “You are a wizard.”"
8068,Riddle lifted his head. His face was transfigured: There was a
8069,"wild happiness upon it, yet for some reason it did not make him"
8070,"better looking; on the contrary, his finely carved features seemed"
8071,"somehow rougher, his expression almost bestial."
8072,“Are you a wizard too?”
8073,"“Yes, I am.”"
8074,"“Prove it,” said Riddle at once, in the same commanding tone he"
8075,"had used when he had said, “Tell the truth.”"
8076,"Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “If, as I take it, you are accept-"
8077,ing your place at Hogwarts —”
8078,“Of course I am!”
8079,“Then you will address me as ‘Professor’ or ‘sir.’ ”
8080, 271  
8081,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
8082,Riddle’s expression hardened for the most fleeting moment be-
8083,"fore he said, in an unrecognizably polite voice, “I’m sorry, sir. I"
8084,"meant — please, Professor, could you show me — ?”"
8085,"Harry was sure that Dumbledore was going to refuse, that he"
8086,would tell Riddle there would be plenty of time for practical
8087,"demonstrations at Hogwarts, that they were currently in a building"
8088,full of Muggles and must therefore be cautious. To his great sur-
8089,"prise, however, Dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket"
8090,"of his suit jacket, pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner,"
8091,and gave the wand a casual flick.
8092,The wardrobe burst into flames.
8093,Riddle jumped to his feet; Harry could hardly blame him for
8094,howling in shock and rage; all his worldly possessions must be in
8095,"there. But even as Riddle rounded on Dumbledore, the flames van-"
8096,"ished, leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged."
8097,"Riddle stared from the wardrobe to Dumbledore; then, his ex-"
8098,"pression greedy, he pointed at the wand. “Where can I get one of"
8099,them?”
8100,"“All in good time,” said Dumbledore. “I think there is some-"
8101,thing trying to get out of your wardrobe.”
8102,"And sure enough, a faint rattling could be heard from inside it."
8103,"For the first time, Riddle looked frightened."
8104,"“Open the door,” said Dumbledore."
8105,"Riddle hesitated, then crossed the room and threw open the"
8106,"wardrobe door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail of threadbare"
8107,"clothes, a small cardboard box was shaking and rattling as though"
8108,there were several frantic mice trapped inside it.
8109,"“Take it out,” said Dumbledore."
8110,Riddle took down the quaking box. He looked unnerved.
8111,  272  
8112,THE SECRET RIDDLE
8113,“Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have?” asked
8114,Dumbledore.
8115,"Riddle threw Dumbledore a long, clear, calculating look. “Yes, I"
8116,"suppose so, sir,” he said finally, in an expressionless voice."
8117,"“Open it,” said Dumbledore."
8118,Riddle took off the lid and tipped the contents onto his bed
8119,"without looking at them. Harry, who had expected something"
8120,"much more exciting, saw a mess of small, everyday objects: a yo-yo,"
8121,"a silver thimble, and a tarnished mouth organ among them. Once"
8122,"free of the box, they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the"
8123,thin blankets.
8124,"“You will return them to their owners with your apologies,” said"
8125,"Dumbledore calmly, putting his wand back into his jacket. “I shall"
8126,know whether it has been done. And be warned: Thieving is not
8127,tolerated at Hogwarts.”
8128,Riddle did not look remotely abashed; he was still staring coldly
8129,"and appraisingly at Dumbledore. At last he said in a colorless voice,"
8130,"“Yes, sir.”"
8131,"“At Hogwarts,” Dumbledore went on, “we teach you not only to"
8132,"use magic, but to control it. You have — inadvertently, I am sure —"
8133,been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated
8134,"at our school. You are not the first, nor will you be the last, to allow"
8135,your magic to run away with you. But you should know that Hog-
8136,"warts can expel students, and the Ministry of Magic — yes, there is"
8137,a Ministry — will punish lawbreakers still more severely. All new
8138,"wizards must accept that, in entering our world, they abide by our"
8139,laws.”
8140,"“Yes, sir,” said Riddle again."
8141,It was impossible to tell what he was thinking; his face remained
8142,  273   
8143,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
8144,quite blank as he put the little cache of stolen objects back into the
8145,"cardboard box. When he had finished, he turned to Dumbledore"
8146,"and said baldly, “I haven’t got any money.”"
8147,"“That is easily remedied,” said Dumbledore, drawing a leather"
8148,money-pouch from his pocket. “There is a fund at Hogwarts for
8149,those who require assistance to buy books and robes. You might have
8150,"to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand, but —”"
8151,"“Where do you buy spellbooks?” interrupted Riddle, who had"
8152,"taken the heavy money bag without thanking Dumbledore, and"
8153,was now examining a fat gold Galleon.
8154,"“In Diagon Alley,” said Dumbledore. “I have your list of books"
8155,and school equipment with me. I can help you find everything —”
8156,"“You’re coming with me?” asked Riddle, looking up."
8157,"“Certainly, if you —”"
8158,"“I don’t need you,” said Riddle. “I’m used to doing things for"
8159,"myself, I go round London on my own all the time. How do you"
8160,"get to this Diagon Alley — sir?” he added, catching Dumbledore’s"
8161,eye.
8162,Harry thought that Dumbledore would insist upon accompany-
8163,"ing Riddle, but once again he was surprised. Dumbledore handed"
8164,"Riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment, and after"
8165,telling Riddle exactly how to get to the Leaky Cauldron from the
8166,"orphanage, he said, “You will be able to see it, although Muggles"
8167,"around you — non-magical people, that is — will not. Ask for"
8168,"Tom the barman — easy enough to remember, as he shares your"
8169,name —”
8170,"Riddle gave an irritable twitch, as though trying to displace an"
8171,irksome fly.
8172,“You dislike the name ‘Tom’?”
8173, 274  
8174,THE SECRET RIDDLE
8175,"“There are a lot of Toms,” muttered Riddle. Then, as though he"
8176,"could not suppress the question, as though it burst from him in"
8177,"spite of himself, he asked, “Was my father a wizard? He was called"
8178,"Tom Riddle too, they’ve told me.”"
8179,"“I’m afraid I don’t know,” said Dumbledore, his voice gentle."
8180,"“My mother can’t have been magic, or she wouldn’t have died,”"
8181,"said Riddle, more to himself than Dumbledore. “It must’ve been"
8182,him. So — when I’ve got all my stuff — when do I come to this
8183,Hogwarts?”
8184,“All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your en-
8185,"velope,” said Dumbledore. “You will leave from King’s Cross Sta-"
8186,tion on the first of September. There is a train ticket in there too.”
8187,Riddle nodded. Dumbledore got to his feet and held out his
8188,"hand again. Taking it, Riddle said, “I can speak to snakes. I found"
8189,"out when we’ve been to the country on trips — they find me, they"
8190,whisper to me. Is that normal for a wizard?”
8191,Harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest
8192,"power until that moment, determined to impress."
8193,"“It is unusual,” said Dumbledore, after a moment’s hesitation,"
8194,“but not unheard of.”
8195,His tone was casual but his eyes moved curiously over Riddle’s
8196,"face. They stood for a moment, man and boy, staring at each other."
8197,Then the handshake was broken; Dumbledore was at the door.
8198,"“Good-bye, Tom. I shall see you at Hogwarts.”"
8199,"“I think that will do,” said the white-haired Dumbledore at"
8200,"Harry’s side, and seconds later, they were soaring weightlessly"
8201,"through darkness once more, before landing squarely in the present-"
8202,day office.
8203,"“Sit down,” said Dumbledore, landing beside Harry."
8204,  275 
8205,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
8206,"Harry obeyed, his mind still full of what he had just seen."
8207,"“He believed it much quicker than I did — I mean, when you"
8208,"told him he was a wizard,” said Harry. “I didn’t believe Hagrid at"
8209,"first, when he told me.”"
8210,"“Yes, Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was — to use"
8211,"his word — ‘special,’ ” said Dumbledore."
8212,“Did you know — then?” asked Harry.
8213,“Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wiz-
8214,"ard of all time?” said Dumbledore. “No, I had no idea that he was"
8215,"to grow up to be what he is. However, I was certainly intrigued by"
8216,"him. I returned to Hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him,"
8217,"something I should have done in any case, given that he was alone"
8218,"and friendless, but which, already, I felt I ought to do for others’"
8219,sake as much as his.
8220,"“His powers, as you heard, were surprisingly well-developed for"
8221,such a young wizard and — most interestingly and ominously of
8222,all — he had already discovered that he had some measure of con-
8223,"trol over them, and begun to use them consciously. And as you saw,"
8224,they were not the random experiments typical of young wizards:
8225,"He was already using magic against other people, to frighten, to"
8226,"punish, to control. The little stories of the strangled rabbit and the"
8227,young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive. . . .
8228,‘I can make them hurt if I want to. . . .’ ”
8229,"“And he was a Parselmouth,” interjected Harry."
8230,"“Yes, indeed; a rare ability, and one supposedly connected with"
8231,"the Dark Arts, although as we know, there are Parselmouths among"
8232,"the great and the good too. In fact, his ability to speak to serpents"
8233,did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cru-
8234,"elty, secrecy, and domination."
8235, 276   
8236,THE SECRET RIDDLE
8237,"“Time is making fools of us again,” said Dumbledore, indicating"
8238,"the dark sky beyond the windows. “But before we part, I want to"
8239,draw your attention to certain features of the scene we have just
8240,"witnessed, for they have a great bearing on the matters we shall be"
8241,discussing in future meetings.
8242,"“Firstly, I hope you noticed Riddle’s reaction when I mentioned"
8243,"that another shared his first name, ‘Tom’?”"
8244,Harry nodded.
8245,“There he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to
8246,"other people, anything that made him ordinary. Even then, he"
8247,"wished to be different, separate, notorious. He shed his name, as"
8248,"you know, within a few short years of that conversation and created"
8249,the mask of ‘Lord Voldemort’ behind which he has been hidden for
8250,so long.
8251,“I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly
8252,"self-sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? He did not"
8253,want help or companionship on his trip to Diagon Alley. He pre-
8254,ferred to operate alone. The adult Voldemort is the same. You will
8255,hear many of his Death Eaters claiming that they are in his confi-
8256,"dence, that they alone are close to him, even understand him. They"
8257,"are deluded. Lord Voldemort has never had a friend, nor do I be-"
8258,lieve that he has ever wanted one.
8259,“And lastly — I hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to
8260,"this, Harry — the young Tom Riddle liked to collect trophies. You"
8261,saw the box of stolen articles he had hidden in his room. These
8262,"were taken from victims of his bullying behavior, souvenirs, if you"
8263,"will, of particularly unpleasant bits of magic. Bear in mind this"
8264,"magpie-like tendency, for this, particularly, will be important later."
8265,"“And now, it really is time for bed.”"
8266, 277   
8267,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
8268,"Harry got to his feet. As he walked across the room, his eyes fell"
8269,upon the little table on which Marvolo Gaunt’s ring had rested last
8270,"time, but the ring was no longer there."
8271,"“Yes, Harry?” said Dumbledore, for Harry had come to a halt."
8272,"“The ring’s gone,” said Harry, looking around. “But I thought"
8273,you might have the mouth organ or something.”
8274,"Dumbledore beamed at him, peering over the top of his half-"
8275,moon spectacles.
8276,"“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth"
8277,organ.”
8278,"And on that enigmatic note he waved to Harry, who understood"
8279,himself to be dismissed.

8284,He had been unable to tell Ron and Hermione about
8285,his lesson with Dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being over-
8286,"heard, but he filled them in as they walked across the vegetable"
8287,patch toward the greenhouses. The weekend’s brutal wind had died
8288,out at last; the weird mist had returned and it took them a little
8289,longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse.
8290,"“Wow, scary thought, the boy You-Know-Who,” said Ron qui-"
8291,"etly, as they took their places around one of the gnarled Snargaluff"
8292,"stumps that formed this term’s project, and began pulling on their"
8293,protective gloves. “But I still don’t get why Dumbledore’s showing
8294,"you all this. I mean, it’s really interesting and everything, but what’s"
8295,the point?”
8296,"“Dunno,” said Harry, inserting a gum shield. “But he says it’s all"
8297,important and it’ll help me survive.”
8298,"“I think it’s fascinating,” said Hermione earnestly. “It makes"
8299,  279  
8300,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8301,absolute sense to know as much about Voldemort as possible. How
8302,else will you find out his weaknesses?”
8303,“So how was Slughorn’s latest party?” Harry asked her thickly
8304,through the gum shield.
8305,"“Oh, it was quite fun, really,” said Hermione, now putting on"
8306,"protective goggles. “I mean, he drones on about famous ex-pupils a"
8307,"bit, and he absolutely fawns on McLaggen because he’s so well-"
8308,"connected, but he gave us some really nice food and he introduced"
8309,us to Gwenog Jones.”
8310,"“Gwenog Jones?” said Ron, his eyes widening under his own"
8311,goggles. “The Gwenog Jones? Captain of the Holyhead Harpies?”
8312,"“That’s right,” said Hermione. “Personally, I thought she was a"
8313,"bit full of herself, but —”"
8314,"“Quite enough chat over here!” said Professor Sprout briskly,"
8315,"bustling over and looking stern. “You’re lagging behind, everybody"
8316,"else has started, and Neville’s already got his first pod!”"
8317,"They looked around; sure enough, there sat Neville with a"
8318,"bloody lip and several nasty scratches along the side of his face, but"
8319,clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a
8320,grapefruit.
8321,"“Okay, Professor, we’re starting now!” said Ron, adding quietly,"
8322,"when she had turned away again, “should’ve used Muffliato, Harry.”"
8323,"“No, we shouldn’t!” said Hermione at once, looking, as she al-"
8324,"ways did, intensely cross at the thought of the Half-Blood Prince"
8325,"and his spells. “Well, come on . . . we’d better get going. . . .”"
8326,She gave the other two an apprehensive look; they all took deep
8327,breaths and then dived at the gnarled stump between them.
8328,"It sprang to life at once; long, prickly, bramblelike vines flew out"
8329,of the top and whipped through the air. One tangled itself in
8330, 280   
8331,FELIX FELICIS
8332,"Hermione’s hair, and Ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs;"
8333,Harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vines and knotting them
8334,together; a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike
8335,"branches; Hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole, which"
8336,closed like a trap around her elbow; Harry and Ron tugged and
8337,"wrenched at the vines, forcing the hole to open again, and Hermi-"
8338,"one snatched her arm free, clutching in her fingers a pod just like"
8339,"Neville’s. At once, the prickly vines shot back inside, and the"
8340,gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of
8341,wood.
8342,"“You know, I don’t think I’ll be having any of these in my garden"
8343,"when I’ve got my own place,” said Ron, pushing his goggles up"
8344,onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face.
8345,"“Pass me a bowl,” said Hermione, holding the pulsating pod at"
8346,arm’s length; Harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into
8347,it with a look of disgust on her face.
8348,"“Don’t be squeamish, squeeze it out, they’re best when they’re"
8349,fresh!” called Professor Sprout.
8350,"“Anyway,” said Hermione, continuing their interrupted conver-"
8351,"sation as though a lump of wood had not just attacked them,"
8352,"“Slughorn’s going to have a Christmas party, Harry, and there’s no"
8353,way you’ll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually
8354,"asked me to check your free evenings, so he could be sure to have it"
8355,on a night you can come.”
8356,"Harry groaned. Meanwhile, Ron, who was attempting to burst"
8357,"the pod in the bowl by putting both hands on it, standing up, and"
8358,"squashing it as hard as he could, said angrily, “And this is another"
8359,"party just for Slughorn’s favorites, is it?”"
8360,"“Just for the Slug Club, yes,” said Hermione."
8361,  281    
8362,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8363,The pod flew out from under Ron’s fingers and hit the green-
8364,"house glass, rebounding onto the back of Professor Sprout’s head"
8365,"and knocking off her old, patched hat. Harry went to retrieve the"
8366,"pod; when he got back, Hermione was saying, “Look, I didn’t make"
8367,up the name ‘Slug Club’ —”
8368,"“ ‘Slug Club,’ ” repeated Ron with a sneer worthy of Malfoy. “It’s"
8369,"pathetic. Well, I hope you enjoy your party. Why don’t you try"
8370,"hooking up with McLaggen, then Slughorn can make you King"
8371,and Queen Slug —”
8372,"“We’re allowed to bring guests,” said Hermione, who for some"
8373,"reason had turned a bright, boiling scarlet, “and I was going to ask"
8374,"you to come, but if you think it’s that stupid then I won’t bother!”"
8375,"Harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther, so that"
8376,he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them. Unno-
8377,"ticed by either, he seized the bowl that contained the pod and be-"
8378,gan to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic means he
8379,"could think of; unfortunately, he could still hear every word of"
8380,their conversation.
8381,"“You were going to ask me?” asked Ron, in a completely differ-"
8382,ent voice.
8383,"“Yes,” said Hermione angrily. “But obviously if you’d rather I"
8384,hooked up with McLaggen . . .”
8385,There was a pause while Harry continued to pound the resilient
8386,pod with a trowel.
8387,"“No, I wouldn’t,” said Ron, in a very quiet voice."
8388,"Harry missed the pod, hit the bowl, and shattered it."
8389,"“Reparo,” he said hastily, poking the pieces with his wand, and"
8390,"the bowl sprang back together again. The crash, however, appeared"
8391,to have awoken Ron and Hermione to Harry’s presence. Hermione
8392, 282  
8393,FELIX FELICIS
8394,looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her
8395,copy of Flesh-Eating Trees of the World to find out the correct way
8396,"to juice Snargaluff pods; Ron, on the other hand, looked sheepish"
8397,but also rather pleased with himself.
8398,"“Hand that over, Harry,” said Hermione hurriedly. “It says we’re"
8399,supposed to puncture them with something sharp. . . .”
8400,Harry passed her the pod in the bowl; he and Ron both snapped
8401,"their goggles back over their eyes and dived, once more, for the"
8402,stump.
8403,"It was not as though he was really surprised, thought Harry, as"
8404,he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him; he had
8405,had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later. But he was
8406,not sure how he felt about it. . . . He and Cho were now too em-
8407,"barrassed to look at each other, let alone talk to each other; what if"
8408,"Ron and Hermione started going out together, then split up?"
8409,Could their friendship survive it? Harry remembered the few weeks
8410,when they had not been talking to each other in the third year; he
8411,had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them. And
8412,"then, what if they didn’t split up? What if they became like Bill and"
8413,"Fleur, and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their"
8414,"presence, so that he was shut out for good?"
8415,"“Gotcha!” yelled Ron, pulling a second pod from the stump just"
8416,"as Hermione managed to burst the first one open, so that the bowl"
8417,was full of tubers wriggling like pale green worms.
8418,The rest of the lesson passed without further mention of
8419,Slughorn’s party. Although Harry watched his two friends more
8420,"closely over the next few days, Ron and Hermione did not seem"
8421,any different except that they were a little politer to each other than
8422,usual. Harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what
8423, 283   
8424,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8425,happened under the influence of butterbeer in Slughorn’s dimly lit
8426,"room on the night of the party. In the meantime, however, he had"
8427,more pressing worries.
8428,Katie Bell was still in St. Mungo’s Hospital with no prospect of
8429,"leaving, which meant that the promising Gryffindor team Harry"
8430,had been training so carefully since September was one Chaser
8431,short. He kept putting off replacing Katie in the hope that she
8432,"would return, but their opening match against Slytherin was loom-"
8433,"ing, and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time"
8434,to play.
8435,Harry did not think he could stand another full-House tryout.
8436,"With a sinking feeling that had little to do with Quidditch, he cor-"
8437,nered Dean Thomas after Transfiguration one day. Most of the
8438,"class had already left, although several twittering yellow birds were"
8439,"still zooming around the room, all of Hermione’s creation; nobody"
8440,else had succeeded in conjuring so much as a feather from thin air.
8441,“Are you still interested in playing Chaser?”
8442,"“Wha — ? Yeah, of course!” said Dean excitedly. Over Dean’s"
8443,"shoulder, Harry saw Seamus Finnigan slamming his books into his"
8444,"bag, looking sour. One of the reasons why Harry would have pre-"
8445,ferred not to have to ask Dean to play was that he knew Seamus
8446,"would not like it. On the other hand, he had to do what was best"
8447,"for the team, and Dean had outflown Seamus at the tryouts."
8448,"“Well then, you’re in,” said Harry. “There’s a practice tonight,"
8449,seven o’clock.”
8450,"“Right,” said Dean. “Cheers, Harry! Blimey, I can’t wait to tell"
8451,Ginny!”
8452,"He sprinted out of the room, leaving Harry and Seamus alone"
8453,"together, an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird"
8454, 284   
8455,FELIX FELICIS
8456,dropping landed on Seamus’s head as one of Hermione’s canaries
8457,whizzed over them.
8458,Seamus was not the only person disgruntled by the choice of
8459,Katie’s substitute. There was much muttering in the common
8460,room about the fact that Harry had now chosen two of his class-
8461,mates for the team. As Harry had endured much worse mutterings
8462,"than this in his school career, he was not particularly bothered,"
8463,"but all the same, the pressure was increasing to provide a win in"
8464,"the upcoming match against Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, Harry"
8465,knew that the whole House would forget that they had criticized
8466,him and swear that they had always known it was a great team. If
8467,"they lost . . . well, Harry thought wryly, he had still endured worse"
8468,mutterings. . . .
8469,Harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw Dean fly
8470,that evening; he worked well with Ginny and Demelza. The Beat-
8471,"ers, Peakes and Coote, were getting better all the time. The only"
8472,problem was Ron.
8473,Harry had known all along that Ron was an inconsistent player
8474,"who suffered from nerves and a lack of confidence, and unfortu-"
8475,"nately, the looming prospect of the opening game of the season"
8476,seemed to have brought out all his old insecurities. After letting in
8477,"half a dozen goals, most of them scored by Ginny, his technique"
8478,"became wilder and wilder, until he finally punched an oncoming"
8479,Demelza Robins in the mouth.
8480,"“It was an accident, I’m sorry, Demelza, really sorry!” Ron"
8481,"shouted after her as she zigzagged back to the ground, dripping"
8482,blood everywhere. “I just —”
8483,"“Panicked,” Ginny said angrily, landing next to Demelza and ex-"
8484,"amining her fat lip. “You prat, Ron, look at the state of her!”"
8485, 285  
8486,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8487,"“I can fix that,” said Harry, landing beside the two girls, pointing"
8488,"his wand at Demelza’s mouth, and saying “Episkey.” “And Ginny,"
8489,"don’t call Ron a prat, you’re not the Captain of this team —”"
8490,"“Well, you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought"
8491,someone should —”
8492,Harry forced himself not to laugh.
8493,"“In the air, everyone, let’s go. . . .”"
8494,"Overall it was one of the worst practices they had had all term,"
8495,though Harry did not feel that honesty was the best policy when
8496,they were this close to the match.
8497,"“Good work, everyone, I think we’ll flatten Slytherin,” he said"
8498,bracingly and the Chasers and Beaters left the changing room
8499,looking reasonably happy with themselves.
8500,"“I played like a sack of dragon dung,” said Ron in a hollow voice"
8501,when the door had swung shut behind Ginny.
8502,"“No, you didn’t,” said Harry firmly. “You’re the best Keeper I"
8503,"tried out, Ron. Your only problem is nerves.”"
8504,He kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back
8505,"to the castle, and by the time they reached the second floor, Ron"
8506,was looking marginally more cheerful. When Harry pushed open
8507,"the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to Gryffindor Tower,"
8508,"however, they found themselves looking at Dean and Ginny, who"
8509,were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely as though glued
8510,together.
8511,It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in
8512,"Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood"
8513,"his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage"
8514,"urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness,"
8515,he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great distance away.
8516, 286    
8517,FELIX FELICIS
8518,“Oi!”
8519,Dean and Ginny broke apart and looked around.
8520,“What?” said Ginny.
8521,“I don’t want to find my own sister snogging people in public!”
8522,“This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in!” said
8523,Ginny.
8524,Dean was looking embarrassed. He gave Harry a shifty grin that
8525,"Harry did not return, as the newborn monster inside him was roar-"
8526,ing for Dean’s instant dismissal from the team.
8527,"“Er . . . c’mon, Ginny,” said Dean, “let’s go back to the common"
8528,room. . . .”
8529,“You go!” said Ginny. “I want a word with my dear brother!”
8530,"Dean left, looking as though he was not sorry to depart the"
8531,scene.
8532,"“Right,” said Ginny, tossing her long red hair out of her face and"
8533,"glaring at Ron, “let’s get this straight once and for all. It is none of"
8534,"your business who I go out with or what I do with them, Ron —”"
8535,"“Yeah, it is!” said Ron, just as angrily. “D’you think I want peo-"
8536,ple saying my sister’s a —”
8537,"“A what?” shouted Ginny, drawing her wand. “A what, exactly?”"
8538,"“He doesn’t mean anything, Ginny —” said Harry automati-"
8539,"cally, though the monster was roaring its approval of Ron’s words."
8540,"“Oh yes he does!” she said, flaring up at Harry. “Just because he’s"
8541,"never snogged anyone in his life, just because the best kiss he’s ever"
8542,had is from our Auntie Muriel —”
8543,"“Shut your mouth!” bellowed Ron, bypassing red and turning"
8544,maroon.
8545,"“No, I will not!” yelled Ginny, beside herself. “I’ve seen you with"
8546,"Phlegm, hoping she’ll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her,"
8547, 287   
8548,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8549,it’s pathetic! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done your-
8550,"self, you wouldn’t mind so much that everyone else does it!”"
8551,Ron had pulled out his wand too; Harry stepped swiftly between
8552,them.
8553,"“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Ron roared, trying"
8554,"to get a clear shot at Ginny around Harry, who was now standing"
8555,in front of her with his arms outstretched. “Just because I don’t do
8556,it in public — !”
8557,"Ginny screamed with derisive laughter, trying to push Harry out"
8558,of the way.
8559,"“Been kissing Pigwidgeon, have you? Or have you got a picture"
8560,of Auntie Muriel stashed under your pillow?”
8561,“You—”
8562,A streak of orange light flew under Harry’s left arm and missed
8563,Ginny by inches; Harry pushed Ron up against the wall.
8564,“Don’t be stupid —”
8565,"“Harry’s snogged Cho Chang!” shouted Ginny, who sounded"
8566,"close to tears now. “And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum, it’s only"
8567,"you who acts like it’s something disgusting, Ron, and that’s because"
8568,you’ve got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old!”
8569,"And with that, she stormed away. Harry quickly let go of Ron;"
8570,"the look on his face was murderous. They both stood there, breath-"
8571,"ing heavily, until Mrs. Norris, Filch’s cat, appeared around the cor-"
8572,"ner, which broke the tension."
8573,"“C’mon,” said Harry, as the sound of Filch’s shuffling feet"
8574,reached their ears.
8575,They hurried up the stairs and along a seventh-floor corridor.
8576,"“Oi, out of the way!” Ron barked at a small girl who jumped in"
8577,fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn.
8578, 288  
8579,FELIX FELICIS
8580,Harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass; he felt dis-
8581,"oriented, dizzy; being struck by a lightning bolt must be something"
8582,"like this. It’s just because she’s Ron’s sister, he told himself. You just"
8583,didn’t like seeing her kissing Dean because she’s Ron’s sister. . . .
8584,But unbidden into his mind came an image of that same de-
8585,serted corridor with himself kissing Ginny instead. . . . The mon-
8586,ster in his chest purred . . . but then he saw Ron ripping open the
8587,"tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on Harry, shouting things"
8588,like “betrayal of trust” . . . “supposed to be my friend” . . .
8589,"“D’you think Hermione did snog Krum?” Ron asked abruptly,"
8590,as they approached the Fat Lady. Harry gave a guilty start and
8591,wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no Ron
8592,"intruded, in which he and Ginny were quite alone —"
8593,“What?” he said confusedly. “Oh . . . er . . .”
8594,"The honest answer was “yes,” but he did not want to give it."
8595,"However, Ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on Harry’s"
8596,face.
8597,"“Dilligrout,” he said darkly to the Fat Lady, and they climbed"
8598,through the portrait hole into the common room.
8599,"Neither of them mentioned Ginny or Hermione again; indeed,"
8600,they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in si-
8601,"lence, each absorbed in his own thoughts."
8602,"Harry lay awake for a long time, looking up at the canopy of his"
8603,four-poster and trying to convince himself that his feelings for
8604,"Ginny were entirely elder-brotherly. They had lived, had they not,"
8605,"like brother and sister all summer, playing Quidditch, teasing Ron,"
8606,and having a laugh about Bill and Phlegm? He had known Ginny
8607,for years now. . . . It was natural that he should feel protective . . .
8608,natural that he should want to look out for her . . . want to rip
8609, 289   
8610,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8611,Dean limb from limb for kissing her . . . No . . . he would have to
8612,control that particular brotherly feeling. . . .
8613,Ron gave a great grunting snore.
8614,"She’s Ron’s sister, Harry told himself firmly. Ron’s sister. She’s out-of-"
8615,bounds. He would not risk his friendship with Ron for anything.
8616,He punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited
8617,"for sleep to come, trying his utmost not to allow his thoughts to"
8618,stray anywhere near Ginny.
8619,Harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused
8620,by a series of dreams in which Ron had chased him with a Beater’s
8621,"bat, but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream"
8622,"Ron for the real one, who was not only cold-shouldering Ginny"
8623,"and Dean, but also treating a hurt and bewildered Hermione with"
8624,"an icy, sneering indifference. What was more, Ron seemed to have"
8625,"become, overnight, as touchy and ready to lash out as the average"
8626,Blast-Ended Skrewt. Harry spent the day attempting to keep the
8627,"peace between Ron and Hermione with no success; finally, Hermi-"
8628,"one departed for bed in high dudgeon, and Ron stalked off to the"
8629,boys’ dormitory after swearing angrily at several frightened first
8630,years for looking at him.
8631,"To Harry’s dismay, Ron’s new aggression did not wear off over the"
8632,"next few days. Worse still, it coincided with an even deeper dip in his"
8633,"Keeping skills, which made him still more aggressive, so that during"
8634,"the final Quidditch practice before Saturday’s match, he failed to"
8635,"save every single goal the Chasers aimed at him, but bellowed at"
8636,everybody so much that he reduced Demelza Robins to tears.
8637,"“You shut up and leave her alone!” shouted Peakes, who was about"
8638,"two-thirds Ron’s height, though admittedly carrying a heavy bat."
8639, 290  
8640,FELIX FELICIS
8641,"“ENOUGH!” bellowed Harry, who had seen Ginny glowering"
8642,"in Ron’s direction and, remembering her reputation as an accom-"
8643,"plished caster of the Bat-Bogey Hex, soared over to intervene be-"
8644,"fore things got out of hand. “Peakes, go and pack up the Bludgers."
8645,"Demelza, pull yourself together, you played really well today."
8646,Ron . . .” he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot
8647,"before saying it, “you’re my best mate, but carry on treating the rest"
8648,of them like this and I’m going to kick you off the team.”
8649,"He really thought for a moment that Ron might hit him, but then"
8650,something much worse happened: Ron seemed to sag on his broom;
8651,"all the fight went out of him and he said, “I resign. I’m pathetic.”"
8652,“You’re not pathetic and you’re not resigning!” said Harry
8653,"fiercely, seizing Ron by the front of his robes. “You can save any-"
8654,"thing when you’re on form, it’s a mental problem you’ve got!”"
8655,“You calling me mental?”
8656,"“Yeah, maybe I am!”"
8657,"They glared at each other for a moment, then Ron shook his"
8658,head wearily. “I know you haven’t got any time to find another
8659,"Keeper, so I’ll play tomorrow, but if we lose, and we will, I’m tak-"
8660,ing myself off the team.”
8661,Nothing Harry said made any difference. He tried boosting
8662,"Ron’s confidence all through dinner, but Ron was too busy being"
8663,grumpy and surly with Hermione to notice. Harry persisted in
8664,"the common room that evening, but his assertion that the whole"
8665,team would be devastated if Ron left was somewhat undermined
8666,by the fact that the rest of the team was sitting in a huddle in a
8667,"distant corner, clearly muttering about Ron and casting him"
8668,nasty looks. Finally Harry tried getting angry again in the hope
8669, 291  
8670,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8671,"of provoking Ron into a defiant, and hopefully goal-saving,"
8672,"attitude, but this strategy did not appear to work any better than"
8673,encouragement; Ron went to bed as dejected and hopeless as
8674,ever.
8675,Harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness. He did not
8676,want to lose the upcoming match; not only was it his first as Cap-
8677,"tain, but he was determined to beat Draco Malfoy at Quidditch"
8678,even if he could not yet prove his suspicions about him. Yet if Ron
8679,"played as he had done in the last few practices, their chances of"
8680,winning were very slim. . . .
8681,If only there was something he could do to make Ron pull him-
8682,self together . . . make him play at the top of his form . . . some-
8683,thing that would ensure that Ron had a really good day. . . .
8684,"And the answer came to Harry in one, sudden, glorious stroke of"
8685,inspiration.
8686,Breakfast was the usual excitable affair next morning; the
8687,Slytherins hissed and booed loudly as every member of the Gryffin-
8688,dor team entered the Great Hall. Harry glanced at the ceiling and
8689,"saw a clear, pale blue sky: a good omen."
8690,"The Gryffindor table, a solid mass of red and gold, cheered as"
8691,Harry and Ron approached. Harry grinned and waved; Ron gri-
8692,maced weakly and shook his head.
8693,"“Cheer up, Ron!” called Lavender. “I know you’ll be brilliant!”"
8694,Ron ignored her.
8695,“Tea?” Harry asked him. “Coffee? Pumpkin juice?”
8696,"“Anything,” said Ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast."
8697,"A few minutes later Hermione, who had become so tired of"
8698,Ron’s recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to
8699,"breakfast with them, paused on her way up the table."

8701,FELIX FELICIS
8702,"“How are you both feeling?” she asked tentatively, her eyes on"
8703,the back of Ron’s head.
8704,"“Fine,” said Harry, who was concentrating on handing Ron a"
8705,"glass of pumpkin juice. “There you go, Ron. Drink up.”"
8706,Ron had just raised the glass to his lips when Hermione spoke
8707,sharply.
8708,"“Don’t drink that, Ron!”"
8709,Both Harry and Ron looked up at her.
8710,“Why not?” said Ron.
8711,Hermione was now staring at Harry as though she could not be-
8712,lieve her eyes.
8713,“You just put something in that drink.”
8714,“Excuse me?” said Harry.
8715,“You heard me. I saw you. You just tipped something into Ron’s
8716,drink. You’ve got the bottle in your hand right now!”
8717,"“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” said Harry, stowing"
8718,the little bottle hastily in his pocket.
8719,"“Ron, I warn you, don’t drink it!” Hermione said again,"
8720,"alarmed, but Ron picked up the glass, drained it in one gulp, and"
8721,"said, “Stop bossing me around, Hermione.”"
8722,She looked scandalized. Bending low so that only Harry could
8723,"hear her, she hissed, “You should be expelled for that. I’d never have"
8724,"believed it of you, Harry!”"
8725,"“Hark who’s talking,” he whispered back. “Confunded anyone"
8726,lately?”
8727,She stormed up the table away from them. Harry watched her go
8728,without regret. Hermione had never really understood what a
8729,"serious business Quidditch was. He then looked around at Ron,"
8730,who was smacking his lips.
8731, 293   
8732,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8733,"“Nearly time,” said Harry blithely."
8734,The frosty grass crunched underfoot as they strode down to the
8735,stadium.
8736,"“Pretty lucky the weather’s this good, eh?” Harry asked Ron."
8737,"“Yeah,” said Ron, who was pale and sick-looking."
8738,Ginny and Demelza were already wearing their Quidditch robes
8739,and waiting in the changing room.
8740,"“Conditions look ideal,” said Ginny, ignoring Ron. “And guess"
8741,what? That Slytherin Chaser Vaisey — he took a Bludger in the
8742,"head yesterday during their practice, and he’s too sore to play! And"
8743,even better than that — Malfoy’s gone off sick too!”
8744,"“What?” said Harry, wheeling around to stare at her. “He’s ill?"
8745,What’s wrong with him?”
8746,"“No idea, but it’s great for us,” said Ginny brightly. “They’re"
8747,playing Harper instead; he’s in my year and he’s an idiot.”
8748,"Harry smiled back vaguely, but as he pulled on his scarlet robes"
8749,his mind was far from Quidditch. Malfoy had once before claimed
8750,"he could not play due to injury, but on that occasion he had made"
8751,sure the whole match was rescheduled for a time that suited the
8752,Slytherins better. Why was he now happy to let a substitute go on?
8753,"Was he really ill, or was he faking?"
8754,"“Fishy, isn’t it?” he said in an undertone to Ron. “Malfoy not"
8755,playing?”
8756,"“Lucky, I call it,” said Ron, looking slightly more animated."
8757,"“And Vaisey off too, he’s their best goal scorer, I didn’t fancy —"
8758,"hey!” he said suddenly, freezing halfway through pulling on his"
8759,Keeper’s gloves and staring at Harry.
8760,“What?”
8761, 294  
8762,FELIX FELICIS
8763,"“I . . . you . . .” Ron had dropped his voice, he looked both"
8764,scared and excited. “My drink . . . my pumpkin juice . . . you
8765,didn’t . . . ?”
8766,"Harry raised his eyebrows, but said nothing except, “We’ll be"
8767,"starting in about five minutes, you’d better get your boots on.”"
8768,They walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roars and boos.
8769,"One end of the stadium was solid red and gold; the other, a sea of"
8770,green and silver. Many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws had taken sides
8771,too: Amidst all the yelling and clapping Harry could distinctly hear
8772,the roar of Luna Lovegood’s famous lion-topped hat.
8773,"Harry stepped up to Madam Hooch, the referee, who was stand-"
8774,ing ready to release the balls from the crate.
8775,"“Captains shake hands,” she said, and Harry had his hand"
8776,"crushed by the new Slytherin Captain, Urquhart. “Mount your"
8777,brooms. On the whistle . . . three . . . two . . . one . . .”
8778,"The whistle sounded, Harry and the others kicked off hard from"
8779,"the frozen ground, and they were away."
8780,"Harry soared around the perimeter of the grounds, looking"
8781,"around for the Snitch and keeping one eye on Harper, who was"
8782,zigzagging far below him. Then a voice that was jarringly different
8783,to the usual commentator’s started up.
8784,"“Well, there they go, and I think we’re all surprised to see the"
8785,"team that Potter’s put together this year. Many thought, given"
8786,"Ronald Weasley’s patchy performance as Keeper last year, that he"
8787,"might be off the team, but of course, a close personal friendship"
8788,with the Captain does help. . . .”
8789,These words were greeted with jeers and applause from the
8790,Slytherin end of the pitch. Harry craned around on his broom to
8791, 295  
8792,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8793,"look toward the commentator’s podium. A tall, skinny blond boy"
8794,"with an upturned nose was standing there, talking into the magical"
8795,megaphone that had once been Lee Jordan’s; Harry recognized
8796,"Zacharias Smith, a Hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked."
8797,"“Oh, and here comes Slytherin’s first attempt on goal, it’s"
8798,Urquhart streaking down the pitch and —”
8799,Harry’s stomach turned over.
8800,"“— Weasley saves it, well, he’s bound to get lucky sometimes, I"
8801,suppose. . . .”
8802,"“That’s right, Smith, he is,” muttered Harry, grinning to him-"
8803,"self, as he dived amongst the Chasers with his eyes searching all"
8804,around for some hint of the elusive Snitch.
8805,"With half an hour of the game gone, Gryffindor were leading"
8806,"sixty points to zero, Ron having made some truly spectacular saves,"
8807,"some by the very tips of his gloves, and Ginny having scored four of"
8808,Gryffindor’s six goals. This effectively stopped Zacharias won-
8809,dering loudly whether the two Weasleys were only there because
8810,"Harry liked them, and he started on Peakes and Coote instead."
8811,"“Of course, Coote isn’t really the usual build for a Beater,” said"
8812,"Zacharias loftily, “they’ve generally got a bit more muscle —”"
8813,“Hit a Bludger at him!” Harry called to Coote as he zoomed
8814,"past, but Coote, grinning broadly, chose to aim the next Bludger at"
8815,"Harper instead, who was just passing Harry in the opposite direc-"
8816,tion. Harry was pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the
8817,Bludger had found its mark.
8818,It seemed as though Gryffindor could do no wrong. Again and
8819,"again they scored, and again and again, at the other end of the"
8820,"pitch, Ron saved goals with apparent ease. He was actually smiling"
8821,"now, and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a"
8822, 296   
8823,FELIX FELICIS
8824,"rousing chorus of the old favorite “Weasley Is Our King,” he pre-"
8825,tended to conduct them from on high.
8826,"“Thinks he’s something special today, doesn’t he?” said a snide"
8827,"voice, and Harry was nearly knocked off his broom as Harper col-"
8828,lided with him hard and deliberately. “Your blood-traitor pal . . .”
8829,"Madam Hooch’s back was turned, and though Gryffindors be-"
8830,"low shouted in anger, by the time she looked around, Harper had"
8831,"already sped off. His shoulder aching, Harry raced after him, de-"
8832,termined to ram him back. . . .
8833,“And I think Harper of Slytherin’s seen the Snitch!” said
8834,"Zacharias Smith through his megaphone. “Yes, he’s certainly seen"
8835,something Potter hasn’t!”
8836,"Smith really was an idiot, thought Harry, hadn’t he noticed them"
8837,"collide? But next moment, his stomach seemed to drop out of the"
8838,sky — Smith was right and Harry was wrong: Harper had not sped
8839,upward at random; he had spotted what Harry had not: The Snitch
8840,"was speeding along high above them, glinting brightly against the"
8841,clear blue sky.
8842,Harry accelerated; the wind was whistling in his ears so that it
8843,"drowned all sound of Smith’s commentary or the crowd, but"
8844,"Harper was still ahead of him, and Gryffindor was only a hundred"
8845,points up; if Harper got there first Gryffindor had lost . . . and now
8846,"Harper was feet from it, his hand outstretched. . . ."
8847,"“Oi, Harper!” yelled Harry in desperation. “How much did"
8848,Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him?”
8849,"He did not know what made him say it, but Harper did a dou-"
8850,"ble-take; he fumbled the Snitch, let it slip through his fingers, and"
8851,"shot right past it. Harry made a great swipe for the tiny, fluttering"
8852,ball and caught it.
8853, 297  
8854,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8855,"“YES!” Harry yelled. Wheeling around, he hurtled back toward"
8856,"the ground, the Snitch held high in his hand. As the crowd realized"
8857,"what had happened, a great shout went up that almost drowned"
8858,the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game.
8859,"“Ginny, where’re you going?” yelled Harry, who had found him-"
8860,self trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the
8861,"team, but Ginny sped right on past them until, with an almighty"
8862,"crash, she collided with the commentator’s podium. As the crowd"
8863,"shrieked and laughed, the Gryffindor team landed beside the"
8864,wreckage of wood under which Zacharias was feebly stirring;
8865,Harry heard Ginny saying blithely to an irate Professor McGona-
8866,"gall, “Forgot to brake, Professor, sorry.”"
8867,"Laughing, Harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged"
8868,"Ginny, but let go very quickly. Avoiding her gaze, he clapped a"
8869,"cheering Ron on the back instead as, all enmity forgotten, the"
8870,"Gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm, punching the air and"
8871,waving to their supporters.
8872,The atmosphere in the changing room was jubilant.
8873,"“Party up in the common room, Seamus said!” yelled Dean exu-"
8874,"berantly. “C’mon, Ginny, Demelza!”"
8875,Ron and Harry were the last two in the changing room. They
8876,were just about to leave when Hermione entered. She was twisting
8877,her Gryffindor scarf in her hands and looked upset but determined.
8878,"“I want a word with you, Harry.” She took a deep breath. “You"
8879,"shouldn’t have done it. You heard Slughorn, it’s illegal.”"
8880,"“What are you going to do, turn us in?” demanded Ron."
8881,"“What are you two talking about?” asked Harry, turning away to"
8882,hang up his robes so that neither of them would see him grinning.
8883,“You know perfectly well what we’re talking about!” said Hermi-
8884, 298   
8885,FELIX FELICIS
8886,one shrilly. “You spiked Ron’s juice with lucky potion at breakfast!
8887,Felix Felicis!”
8888,"“No, I didn’t,” said Harry, turning back to face them both."
8889,"“Yes you did, Harry, and that’s why everything went right, there"
8890,were Slytherin players missing and Ron saved everything!”
8891,"“I didn’t put it in!” said Harry, grinning broadly. He slipped his"
8892,hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that
8893,Hermione had seen in his hand that morning. It was full of golden
8894,potion and the cork was still tightly sealed with wax. “I wanted
8895,"Ron to think I’d done it, so I faked it when I knew you were look-"
8896,ing.” He looked at Ron. “You saved everything because you felt
8897,lucky. You did it all yourself.”
8898,He pocketed the potion again.
8899,"“There really wasn’t anything in my pumpkin juice?” Ron said,"
8900,astounded. “But the weather’s good . . . and Vaisey couldn’t play.
8901,. . . I honestly haven’t been given lucky potion?”
8902,"Harry shook his head. Ron gaped at him for a moment, then"
8903,"rounded on Hermione, imitating her voice. “You added Felix Felicis"
8904,"to Ron’s juice this morning, that’s why he saved everything! See! I can"
8905,"save goals without help, Hermione!”"
8906,"“I never said you couldn’t — Ron, you thought you’d been given"
8907,it too!”
8908,But Ron had already strode past her out of the door with his
8909,broomstick over his shoulder.
8910,"“Er,” said Harry into the sudden silence; he had not expected his"
8911,"plan to backfire like this, “shall . . . shall we go up to the party,"
8912,then?”
8913,"“You go!” said Hermione, blinking back tears. “I’m sick of Ron"
8914,"at the moment, I don’t know what I’m supposed to have done. . . .”"
8915, 299   
8916,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8917,And she stormed out of the changing room too.
8918,Harry walked slowly back up the grounds toward the castle
8919,"through the crowd, many of whom shouted congratulations at"
8920,"him, but he felt a great sense of letdown; he had been sure that if"
8921,"Ron won the match, he and Hermione would be friends again im-"
8922,mediately. He did not see how he could possibly explain to Hermi-
8923,"one that what she had done to offend Ron was kiss Viktor Krum,"
8924,not when the offense had occurred so long ago.
8925,Harry could not see Hermione at the Gryffindor celebration
8926,"party, which was in full swing when he arrived. Renewed cheers"
8927,"and clapping greeted his appearance, and he was soon surrounded"
8928,by a mob of people congratulating him. What with trying to shake
8929,"off the Creevey brothers, who wanted a blow-by-blow match"
8930,"analysis, and the large group of girls that encircled him, laughing at"
8931,"his least amusing comments and batting their eyelids, it was some"
8932,"time before he could try and find Ron. At last, he extricated him-"
8933,"self from Romilda Vane, who was hinting heavily that she would"
8934,like to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party with him. As he was duck-
8935,"ing toward the drinks table, he walked straight into Ginny, Arnold"
8936,the Pygmy Puff riding on her shoulder and Crookshanks mewing
8937,hopefully at her heels.
8938,"“Looking for Ron?” she asked, smirking. “He’s over there, the"
8939,filthy hypocrite.”
8940,"Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full"
8941,"view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around"
8942,Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.
8943,"“It looks like he’s eating her face, doesn’t it?” said Ginny dispas-"
8944,sionately. “But I suppose he’s got to refine his technique somehow.
8945,"Good game, Harry.”"
8946, 300    
8947,FELIX FELICIS
8948,She patted him on the arm; Harry felt a swooping sensation in his
8949,"stomach, but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer."
8950,"Crookshanks trotted after her, his yellow eyes fixed upon Arnold."
8951,"Harry turned away from Ron, who did not look like he would"
8952,"be surfacing soon, just as the portrait hole was closing. With a sink-"
8953,"ing feeling, he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whip-"
8954,ping out of sight.
8955,"He darted forward, sidestepped Romilda Vane again, and"
8956,pushed open the portrait of the Fat Lady. The corridor outside
8957,seemed to be deserted.
8958,“Hermione?”
8959,He found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried. She was
8960,"sitting on the teacher’s desk, alone except for a small ring of twit-"
8961,"tering yellow birds circling her head, which she had clearly just"
8962,conjured out of midair. Harry could not help admiring her spell-
8963,work at a time like this.
8964,"“Oh, hello, Harry,” she said in a brittle voice. “I was just prac-"
8965,ticing.”
8966,“Yeah . . . they’re — er — really good. . . .” said Harry.
8967,He had no idea what to say to her. He was just wondering
8968,"whether there was any chance that she had not noticed Ron, that"
8969,she had merely left the room because the party was a little too
8970,"rowdy, when she said, in an unnaturally high-pitched voice, “Ron"
8971,seems to be enjoying the celebrations.”
8972,“Er . . . does he?” said Harry.
8973,"“Don’t pretend you didn’t see him,” said Hermione. “He wasn’t"
8974,"exactly hiding it, was — ?”"
8975,"The door behind them burst open. To Harry’s horror, Ron came"
8976,"in, laughing, pulling Lavender by the hand."
8977, 301  
8978,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8979,"“Oh,” he said, drawing up short at the sight of Harry and"
8980,Hermione.
8981,"“Oops!” said Lavender, and she backed out of the room, gig-"
8982,gling. The door swung shut behind her.
8983,"There was a horrible, swelling, billowing silence. Hermione was"
8984,"staring at Ron, who refused to look at her, but said with an odd"
8985,"mixture of bravado and awkwardness, “Hi, Harry! Wondered"
8986,where you’d got to!”
8987,Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds con-
8988,tinued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like
8989,"a strange, feathery model of the solar system."
8990,"“You shouldn’t leave Lavender waiting outside,” she said quietly."
8991,“She’ll wonder where you’ve gone.”
8992,She walked very slowly and erectly toward the door. Harry
8993,"glanced at Ron, who was looking relieved that nothing worse had"
8994,happened.
8995,“Oppugno!” came a shriek from the doorway.
8996,"Harry spun around to see Hermione pointing her wand at Ron,"
8997,her expression wild: The little flock of birds was speeding like a hail
8998,"of fat golden bullets toward Ron, who yelped and covered his face"
8999,"with his hands, but the birds attacked, pecking and clawing at"
9000,every bit of flesh they could reach.
9001,"“Gerremoffme!” he yelled, but with one last look of vindictive"
9002,"fury, Hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through"
9003,it. Harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed.
9004, 302   
9005,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9006,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9007,S   now was swirling against the icy windows once more; Christ-
9008,mas was approaching fast. Hagrid had already single-handedly
9009,delivered the usual twelve Christmas trees for the Great Hall; gar-
9010,lands of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banisters of
9011,the stairs; everlasting candles glowed from inside the helmets of
9012,suits of armor and great bunches of mistletoe had been hung at in-
9013,tervals along the corridors. Large groups of girls tended to converge
9014,"underneath the mistletoe bunches every time Harry went past,"
9015,"which caused blockages in the corridors; fortunately, however,"
9016,Harry’s frequent nighttime wanderings had given him an unusually
9017,"good knowledge of the castle’s secret passageways, so that he was"
9018,"able, without too much difficulty, to navigate mistletoe-free routes"
9019,between classes.
9020,"Ron, who might once have found the necessity of these detours"
9021,"a cause for jealousy rather than hilarity, simply roared with laugh-"
9022,"ter about it all. Although Harry much preferred this new laughing,"
9023, 303  
9024,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9025,"joking Ron to the moody, aggressive model he had been enduring"
9026,"for the last few weeks, the improved Ron came at a heavy price."
9027,"Firstly, Harry had to put up with the frequent presence of Laven-"
9028,"der Brown, who seemed to regard any moment that she was not"
9029,"kissing Ron as a moment wasted; and secondly, Harry found him-"
9030,self once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely
9031,ever to speak to each other again.
9032,"Ron, whose hands and forearms still bore scratches and cuts"
9033,"from Hermione’s bird attack, was taking a defensive and resentful"
9034,tone.
9035,"“She can’t complain,” he told Harry. “She snogged Krum. So"
9036,"she’s found out someone wants to snog me too. Well, it’s a free"
9037,country. I haven’t done anything wrong.”
9038,"Harry did not answer, but pretended to be absorbed in the book"
9039,they were supposed to have read before Charms next morning
9040,(Quintessence: A Quest). Determined as he was to remain friends
9041,"with both Ron and Hermione, he was spending a lot of time with"
9042,his mouth shut tight.
9043,"“I never promised Hermione anything,” Ron mumbled. “I"
9044,"mean, all right, I was going to go to Slughorn’s Christmas party"
9045,"with her, but she never said . . . just as friends . . . I’m a free"
9046,agent. . . .”
9047,"Harry turned a page of Quintessence, aware that Ron was watch-"
9048,"ing him. Ron’s voice tailed away in mutters, barely audible over the"
9049,"loud crackling of the fire, though Harry thought he caught the"
9050,words “Krum” and “can’t complain” again.
9051,Hermione’s schedule was so full that Harry could only talk to
9052,"her properly in the evenings, when Ron was, in any case, so tightly"
9053, 304  
9054,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9055,wrapped around Lavender that he did not notice what Harry was
9056,doing. Hermione refused to sit in the common room while Ron
9057,"was there, so Harry generally joined her in the library, which meant"
9058,that their conversations were held in whispers.
9059,"“He’s at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes,” said Hermi-"
9060,"one, while the librarian, Madam Pince, prowled the shelves behind"
9061,them. “I really couldn’t care less.”
9062,She raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punc-
9063,tured a hole in her parchment. Harry said nothing. He thought his
9064,voice might soon vanish from lack of use. He bent a little lower

9066,"Everlasting Elixirs, occasionally pausing to decipher the Prince’s"
9067,useful additions to Libatius Borage’s text.
9068,"“And incidentally,” said Hermione, after a few moments, “you"
9069,need to be careful.”
9070,"“For the last time,” said Harry, speaking in a slightly hoarse"
9071,"whisper after three-quarters of an hour of silence, “I am not giving"
9072,"back this book, I’ve learned more from the Half-Blood Prince than"

9077,"before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there,"
9078,"including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a"
9079,love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take
9080,"them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred"
9081,"and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably"

9085,“Why didn’t you confiscate them then?” demanded Harry. It
9086,seemed extraordinary that Hermione’s mania for upholding rules
9087,could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture.
9088,"“They didn’t have the potions with them in the bathroom,” said"
9089,Hermione scornfully. “They were just discussing tactics. As I doubt
9090,whether even the Half-Blood Prince” — she gave the book another
9091,nasty look — “could dream up an antidote for a dozen different
9092,"love potions at once, I’d just invite someone to go with you, that’ll"
9093,stop all the others thinking they’ve still got a chance. It’s tomorrow
9094,"night, they’re getting desperate.”"
9095,"“There isn’t anyone I want to invite,” mumbled Harry, who was"
9096,"still trying not to think about Ginny any more than he could help,"
9097,despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dreams in ways
9098,that made him devoutly thankful that Ron could not perform
9099,Legilimency.
9100,"“Well, just be careful what you drink, because Romilda Vane"
9101,"looked like she meant business,” said Hermione grimly."
9102,She hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she was
9103,writing her Arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with
9104,her quill. Harry watched her with his mind a long way away.
9105,"“Hang on a moment,” he said slowly. “I thought Filch had"
9106,banned anything bought at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes?”
9107,“And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has
9108,"banned?” asked Hermione, still concentrating on her essay."
9109,“But I thought all the owls were being searched. So how come
9110,these girls are able to bring love potions into school?”
9111,“Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough
9112,"potions,” said Hermione. “It’s part of their Owl Order Service.”"
9113,“You know a lot about it.”

9115,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9116,Hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his
9117,copy of Advanced Potion-Making.
9118,“It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me
9119,"in the summer,” she said coldly. “I don’t go around putting potions"
9120,"in people’s drinks . . . or pretending to, either, which is just as"
9121,bad. . . .”
9122,"“Yeah, well, never mind that,” said Harry quickly. “The point is,"
9123,"Filch is being fooled, isn’t he? These girls are getting stuff into the"
9124,school disguised as something else! So why couldn’t Malfoy have
9125,brought the necklace into the school — ?”
9126,"“Oh, Harry . . . not that again . . .”"
9127,"“Come on, why not?” demanded Harry."
9128,"“Look,” sighed Hermione, “Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes, curses,"
9129,"and concealment charms, don’t they? They’re used to find Dark"
9130,"Magic and Dark objects. They’d have picked up a powerful curse,"
9131,"like the one on that necklace, within seconds. But something that’s"
9132,"just been put in the wrong bottle wouldn’t register — and anyway,"
9133,love potions aren’t Dark or dangerous —”
9134,"“Easy for you to say,” muttered Harry, thinking of Romilda"
9135,Vane.
9136,“— so it would be down to Filch to realize it wasn’t a cough po-
9137,"tion, and he’s not a very good wizard, I doubt he can tell one po-"
9138,tion from —”
9139,Hermione stopped dead; Harry had heard it too. Somebody had
9140,moved close behind them among the dark bookshelves. They
9141,"waited, and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of Madam"
9142,"Pince appeared around the corner, her sunken cheeks, her skin like"
9143,"parchment, and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly"
9144,by the lamp she was carrying.

9147,"“The library is now closed,” she said. “Mind you return any-"
9148,thing you have borrowed to the correct — what have you been do-
9149,"ing to that book, you depraved boy?”"
9150,"“It isn’t the library’s, it’s mine!” said Harry hastily, snatching his"
9151,copy of Advanced Potion-Making off the table as she lunged at it
9152,with a clawlike hand.
9153,“Despoiled!” she hissed. “Desecrated! Befouled!”
9154,"“It’s just a book that’s been written on!” said Harry, tugging it"
9155,out of her grip.
9156,"She looked as though she might have a seizure; Hermione, who"
9157,"had hastily packed her things, grabbed Harry by the arm and frog-"
9158,marched him away.
9159,“She’ll ban you from the library if you’re not careful. Why did
9160,you have to bring that stupid book?”
9161,"“It’s not my fault she’s barking mad, Hermione. Or d’you think"
9162,she overheard you being rude about Filch? I’ve always thought there
9163,might be something going on between them. . . .”
9164,"“Oh, ha ha . . .”"
9165,"Enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again, they"
9166,"made their way along the deserted, lamp-lit corridors back to the"
9167,"common room, arguing about whether or not Filch and Madam"
9168,Pince were secretly in love with each other.
9169,"“Baubles,” said Harry to the Fat Lady, this being the new, festive"
9170,password.
9171,"“Same to you,” said the Fat Lady with a roguish grin, and she"
9172,swung forward to admit them.
9173,"“Hi, Harry!” said Romilda Vane, the moment he had climbed"
9174,through the portrait hole. “Fancy a gillywater?”

9176,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9177,Hermione gave him a “what-did-I-tell-you?” look over her
9178,shoulder.
9179,"“No thanks,” said Harry quickly. “I don’t like it much.”"
9180,"“Well, take these anyway,” said Romilda, thrusting a box into his"
9181,"hands. “Chocolate Cauldrons, they’ve got firewhisky in them. My"
9182,"gran sent them to me, but I don’t like them.”"
9183,"“Oh — right — thanks a lot,” said Harry, who could not think"
9184,what else to say. “Er — I’m just going over here with . . .”
9185,"He hurried off behind Hermione, his voice tailing away feebly."
9186,"“Told you,” said Hermione succinctly. “Sooner you ask some-"
9187,"one, sooner they’ll all leave you alone and you can —”"
9188,But her face suddenly turned blank; she had just spotted Ron
9189,"and Lavender, who were entwined in the same armchair."
9190,"“Well, good night, Harry,” said Hermione, though it was only"
9191,"seven o’clock in the evening, and she left for the girls’ dormitory"
9192,without another word.
9193,Harry went to bed comforting himself that there was only one
9194,"more day of lessons to struggle through, plus Slughorn’s party, after"
9195,which he and Ron would depart together for the Burrow. It now
9196,seemed impossible that Ron and Hermione would make up with
9197,"each other before the holidays began, but perhaps, somehow, the"
9198,"break would give them time to calm down, think better of their"
9199,behavior. . . .
9200,"But his hopes were not high, and they sank still lower after en-"
9201,during a Transfiguration lesson with them both next day. They had
9202,just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human Trans-
9203,"figuration; working in front of mirrors, they were supposed to be"
9204,changing the color of their own eyebrows. Hermione laughed

9206,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9207,"unkindly at Ron’s disastrous first attempt, during which he some-"
9208,how managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache;
9209,Ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of Hermi-
9210,one jumping up and down in her seat every time Professor McGon-
9211,"agall asked a question, which Lavender and Parvati found deeply"
9212,amusing and which reduced Hermione to the verge of tears again.
9213,"She raced out of the classroom on the bell, leaving half her things"
9214,"behind; Harry, deciding that her need was greater than Ron’s just"
9215,"now, scooped up her remaining possessions and followed her."
9216,He finally tracked her down as she emerged from a girls’ bath-
9217,"room on the floor below. She was accompanied by Luna Lovegood,"
9218,who was patting her vaguely on the back.
9219,"“Oh, hello, Harry,” said Luna. “Did you know one of your eye-"
9220,brows is bright yellow?”
9221,"“Hi, Luna. Hermione, you left your stuff. . . .”"
9222,He held out her books.
9223,"“Oh yes,” said Hermione in a choked voice, taking her things"
9224,and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she was wiping her
9225,"eyes on her pencil case. “Thank you, Harry. Well, I’d better get go-"
9226,ing. . . .”
9227,"And she hurried off, without giving Harry any time to offer"
9228,"words of comfort, though admittedly he could not think of any."
9229,"“She’s a bit upset,” said Luna. “I thought at first it was Moaning"
9230,"Myrtle in there, but it turned out to be Hermione. She said some-"
9231,thing about that Ron Weasley. . . .”
9232,"“Yeah, they’ve had a row,” said Harry."
9233,"“He says very funny things sometimes, doesn’t he?” said Luna, as"
9234,they set off down the corridor together. “But he can be a bit un-
9235,kind. I noticed that last year.”

9237,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9238,"“I s’pose,” said Harry. Luna was demonstrating her usual knack"
9239,of speaking uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite
9240,like her. “So have you had a good term?”
9241,"“Oh, it’s been all right,” said Luna. “A bit lonely without the"
9242,"D.A. Ginny’s been nice, though. She stopped two boys in our"
9243,Transfiguration class calling me ‘Loony’ the other day —”
9244,“How would you like to come to Slughorn’s party with me
9245,tonight?”
9246,The words were out of Harry’s mouth before he could stop
9247,them; he heard himself say them as though it were a stranger
9248,speaking.
9249,Luna turned her protuberant eyes upon him in surprise.
9250,“Slughorn’s party? With you?”
9251,"“Yeah,” said Harry. “We’re supposed to bring guests, so I"
9252,thought you might like . . . I mean . . .” He was keen to make his
9253,"intentions perfectly clear. “I mean, just as friends, you know. But if"
9254,you don’t want to . . .”
9255,He was already half hoping that she didn’t want to.
9256,"“Oh, no, I’d love to go with you as friends!” said Luna, beaming"
9257,as he had never seen her beam before. “Nobody’s ever asked me to
9258,"a party before, as a friend! Is that why you dyed your eyebrow, for"
9259,the party? Should I do mine too?”
9260,"“No,” said Harry firmly, “that was a mistake. I’ll get Hermione"
9261,"to put it right for me. So, I’ll meet you in the entrance hall at eight"
9262,o’clock then.”
9263,“AHA!” screamed a voice from overhead and both of them
9264,"jumped; unnoticed by either of them, they had just passed right"

9269,“Potty asked Loony to go to the party! Potty lurves Loony! Potty
9270,luuuuurves Looooooony!”
9271,"And he zoomed away, cackling and shrieking, “Potty loves Loony!”"
9272,"“Nice to keep these things private,” said Harry. And sure"
9273,"enough, in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that"
9274,Harry Potter was taking Luna Lovegood to Slughorn’s party.
9275,“You could’ve taken anyone!” said Ron in disbelief over dinner.
9276,“Anyone! And you chose Loony Lovegood?”
9277,"“Don’t call her that, Ron,” snapped Ginny, pausing behind"
9278,"Harry on her way to join friends. “I’m really glad you’re taking her,"
9279,"Harry, she’s so excited.”"
9280,And she moved on down the table to sit with Dean. Harry tried
9281,"to feel pleased that Ginny was glad he was taking Luna to the party,"
9282,"but could not quite manage it. A long way along the table, Hermi-"
9283,"one was sitting alone, playing with her stew. Harry noticed Ron"
9284,looking at her furtively.
9285,"“You could say sorry,” suggested Harry bluntly."
9286,"“What, and get attacked by another flock of canaries?” muttered"
9287,Ron.
9288,“What did you have to imitate her for?”
9289,“She laughed at my mustache!”
9290,"“So did I, it was the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen.”"
9291,But Ron did not seem to have heard; Lavender had just arrived
9292,"with Parvati. Squeezing herself in between Harry and Ron, Laven-"
9293,der flung her arms around Ron’s neck.
9294,"“Hi, Harry,” said Parvati who, like him, looked faintly embar-"
9295,rassed and bored by the behavior of their two friends.

9303,Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling
9304,guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He

9307,"“Hi, Parvati!” said Hermione, ignoring Ron and Lavender com-"

9309,"“No invite,” said Parvati gloomily. “I’d love to go, though, it"
9310,"sounds like it’s going to be really good. . . . You’re going, aren’t you?”"
9311,"“Yes, I’m meeting Cormac at eight, and we’re —”"
9312,There was a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a
9313,blocked sink and Ron surfaced. Hermione acted as though she had
9314,not seen or heard anything.
9315,“— we’re going up to the party together.”
9316,"“Cormac?” said Parvati. “Cormac McLaggen, you mean?”"
9317,"“That’s right,” said Hermione sweetly. “The one who almost” —"
9318,she put a great deal of emphasis on the word — “became Gryffin-

9320,"“Are you going out with him, then?” asked Parvati, wide-eyed."
9321,"“Oh — yes — didn’t you know?” said Hermione, with a most"
9322,un-Hermione-ish giggle.
9323,"“No!” said Parvati, looking positively agog at this piece of gossip."
9324,"“Wow, you like your Quidditch players, don’t you? First Krum,"
9325,then McLaggen . . .”
9326,"“I like really good Quidditch players,” Hermione corrected her,"

9335,left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get
9336,revenge.
9337,"When he arrived in the entrance hall at eight o’clock that night,"
9338,"he found an unusually large number of girls lurking there, all of"
9339,whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully as he approached
9340,Luna. She was wearing a set of spangled silver robes that were at-

9342,"wise she looked quite nice. Harry was glad, in any case, that she"
9343,"had left off her radish earrings, her butterbeer cork necklace, and"
9344,her Spectrespecs.
9345,"“Hi,” he said. “Shall we get going then?”"
9346,"“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Where is the party?”"
9347,"“Slughorn’s office,” said Harry, leading her up the marble stair-"
9348,"case away from all the staring and muttering. “Did you hear, there’s"
9349,supposed to be a vampire coming?”
9350,“Rufus Scrimgeour?” asked Luna.
9351,"“I — what?” said Harry, disconcerted. “You mean the Minister"
9352,of Magic?”
9353,"“Yes, he’s a vampire,” said Luna matter-of-factly. “Father wrote a"
9354,very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from

9363,"approaching Slughorn’s office and the sounds of laughter, music,"
9364,and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they
9365,took.
9366,"Whether it had been built that way, or because he had used mag-"
9367,"ical trickery to make it so, Slughorn’s office was much larger than"
9368,the usual teacher’s study. The ceiling and walls had been draped
9369,"with emerald, crimson, and gold hangings, so that it looked as"
9370,though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and
9371,stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp
9372,dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairies were
9373,"fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light. Loud singing accompa-"
9374,nied by what sounded like mandolins issued from a distant corner;
9375,a haze of pipe smoke hung over several elderly warlocks deep in
9376,"conversation, and a number of house-elves were negotiating their"
9377,"way squeakily through the forest of knees, obscured by the heavy"
9378,"silver platters of food they were bearing, so that they looked like lit-"
9379,tle roving tables.
9380,"“Harry, m’boy!” boomed Slughorn, almost as soon as Harry and"
9381,"Luna had squeezed in through the door. “Come in, come in, so"
9382,many people I’d like you to meet!”
9383,Slughorn was wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking
9384,jacket. Gripping Harry’s arm so tightly he might have been hoping
9385,"to Disapparate with him, Slughorn led him purposefully into the"
9386,party; Harry seized Luna’s hand and dragged her along with him.
9387,"“Harry, I’d like you to meet Eldred Worple, an old student of"
9388,"mine, author of Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires —"

9393,"Harry’s hand and shook it enthusiastically; the vampire Sanguini,"
9394,"who was tall and emaciated with dark shadows under his eyes,"
9395,merely nodded. He looked rather bored. A gaggle of girls was
9396,"standing close to him, looking curious and excited."
9397,"“Harry Potter, I am simply delighted!” said Worple, peering"
9398,shortsightedly up into Harry’s face. “I was saying to Professor
9399,"Slughorn only the other day, ‘Where is the biography of Harry Potter"
9400,for which we have all been waiting?’ ”
9401,"“Er,” said Harry, “were you?”"
9402,“Just as modest as Horace described!” said Worple. “But seri-
9403,ously” — his manner changed; it became suddenly businesslike —
9404,“I would be delighted to write it myself — people are craving to
9405,"know more about you, dear boy, craving! If you were prepared to"
9406,"grant me a few interviews, say in four- or five-hour sessions, why,"
9407,we could have the book finished within months. And all with very
9408,"little effort on your part, I assure you — ask Sanguini here if it isn’t"
9409,"quite — Sanguini, stay here!” added Worple, suddenly stern, for"
9410,"the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girls, a"
9411,"rather hungry look in his eye. “Here, have a pasty,” said Worple,"
9412,seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into Sanguini’s hand
9413,before turning his attention back to Harry.
9414,"“My dear boy, the gold you could make, you have no idea —”"
9415,"“I’m definitely not interested,” said Harry firmly, “and I’ve just"
9416,"seen a friend of mine, sorry.”"
9417,He pulled Luna after him into the crowd; he had indeed just

9427,"“Oh, I’ve just escaped — I mean, I’ve just left Cormac,” she"

9430,"“Serves you right for coming with him,” he told her severely."
9431,"“I thought he’d annoy Ron most,” said Hermione dispassion-"

9440,that Professor Trelawney was standing there alone.
9441,"“Hello,” said Luna politely to Professor Trelawney."
9442,"“Good evening, my dear,” said Professor Trelawney, focusing"

9445,"“No, I’ve got Firenze this year,” said Luna."
9446,"“Oh, of course,” said Professor Trelawney with an angry,"

9455,"Under cover of her furious criticisms of Firenze, Harry drew closer"
9456,"to Hermione and said, “Let’s get something straight. Are you plan-"
9457,ning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts?”
9458,Hermione raised her eyebrows. “Do you really think I’d stoop
9459,that low?”
9460,"Harry looked at her shrewdly. “Hermione, if you can ask out"
9461,McLaggen —”
9462,"“There’s a difference,” said Hermione with dignity. “I’ve got no"
9463,"plans to tell Ron anything about what might, or might not, have"
9464,happened at Keeper tryouts.”
9465,"“Good,” said Harry fervently. “Because he’ll just fall apart again,"
9466,and we’ll lose the next match —”
9467,“Quidditch!” said Hermione angrily. “Is that all boys care about?
9468,"Cormac hasn’t asked me one single question about myself, no, I’ve"
9469,just been treated to ‘A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac
9470,"McLaggen’ nonstop ever since — oh no, here he comes!”"
9471,She moved so fast it was as though she had Disapparated; one
9472,"moment she was there, the next, she had squeezed between two"
9473,guffawing witches and vanished.
9474,"“Seen Hermione?” asked McLaggen, forcing his way through"
9475,the throng a minute later.
9476,"“No, sorry,” said Harry, and he turned quickly to join in Luna’s"
9477,"conversation, forgetting for a split second to whom she was talking."
9478,"“Harry Potter!” said Professor Trelawney in deep, vibrant tones,"
9479,noticing him for the first time.
9480,"“Oh, hello,” said Harry unenthusiastically."
9481,“My dear boy!” she said in a very carrying whisper. “The rumors!
9482,"The stories! ‘The Chosen One’! Of course, I have known for a very"
9483,"long time. . . . The omens were never good, Harry. . . . But why"

9485,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9486,"have you not returned to Divination? For you, of all people, the"
9487,subject is of the utmost importance!”
9488,"“Ah, Sybill, we all think our subject’s most important!” said a"
9489,"loud voice, and Slughorn appeared at Professor Trelawney’s other"
9490,"side, his face very red, his velvet hat a little askew, a glass of mead"
9491,in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other. “But I don’t
9492,"think I’ve ever known such a natural at Potions!” said Slughorn, re-"
9493,"garding Harry with a fond, if bloodshot, eye. “Instinctive, you"
9494,know — like his mother! I’ve only ever taught a few with this kind
9495,"of ability, I can tell you that, Sybill — why even Severus —”"
9496,"And to Harry’s horror, Slughorn threw out an arm and seemed"
9497,to scoop Snape out of thin air toward them.
9498,"“Stop skulking and come and join us, Severus!” hiccuped"
9499,Slughorn happily. “I was just talking about Harry’s exceptional po-
9500,"tion-making! Some credit must go to you, of course, you taught"
9501,him for five years!”
9502,"Trapped, with Slughorn’s arm around his shoulders, Snape"
9503,"looked down his hooked nose at Harry, his black eyes narrowed."
9504,"“Funny, I never had the impression that I managed to teach"
9505,Potter anything at all.”
9506,"“Well, then, it’s natural ability!” shouted Slughorn. “You should"
9507,"have seen what he gave me, first lesson, Draught of Living Death —"
9508,"never had a student produce finer on a first attempt, I don’t think"
9509,"even you, Severus —”"
9510,"“Really?” said Snape quietly, his eyes still boring into Harry, who"
9511,felt a certain disquiet. The last thing he wanted was for Snape to
9512,start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at Potions.
9513,"“Remind me what other subjects you’re taking, Harry?” asked"
9514,Slughorn.
9515, 319   
9516,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9517,"“Defense Against the Dark Arts, Charms, Transfiguration,"
9518,Herbology . . .”
9519,"“All the subjects required, in short, for an Auror,” said Snape,"
9520,with the faintest sneer.
9521,"“Yeah, well, that’s what I’d like to do,” said Harry defiantly."
9522,“And a great one you’ll make too!” boomed Slughorn.
9523,"“I don’t think you should be an Auror, Harry,” said Luna unex-"
9524,pectedly. Everybody looked at her. “The Aurors are part of the
9525,"Rotfang Conspiracy, I thought everyone knew that. They’re work-"
9526,ing to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a com-
9527,bination of Dark Magic and gum disease.”
9528,Harry inhaled half his mead up his nose as he started to laugh.
9529,"Really, it had been worth bringing Luna just for this. Emerging"
9530,"from his goblet, coughing, sopping wet but still grinning, he saw"
9531,something calculated to raise his spirits even higher: Draco Malfoy
9532,being dragged by the ear toward them by Argus Filch.
9533,"“Professor Slughorn,” wheezed Filch, his jowls aquiver and the"
9534,"maniacal light of mischief-detection in his bulging eyes, “I discov-"
9535,ered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor. He claims to have
9536,been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out.
9537,Did you issue him with an invitation?”
9538,"Malfoy pulled himself free of Filch’s grip, looking furious."
9539,"“All right, I wasn’t invited!” he said angrily. “I was trying to gate-"
9540,"crash, happy?”"
9541,"“No, I’m not!” said Filch, a statement at complete odds with the"
9542,"glee on his face. “You’re in trouble, you are! Didn’t the headmaster"
9543,"say that nighttime prowling’s out, unless you’ve got permission,"
9544,"didn’t he, eh?”"
9545,"“That’s all right, Argus, that’s all right,” said Slughorn, waving a"

9547,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9548,"hand. “It’s Christmas, and it’s not a crime to want to come to a"
9549,"party. Just this once, we’ll forget any punishment; you may stay,"
9550,Draco.”
9551,Filch’s expression of outraged disappointment was perfectly pre-
9552,"dictable; but why, Harry wondered, watching him, did Malfoy"
9553,look almost equally unhappy? And why was Snape looking at Mal-
9554,foy as though both angry and . . . was it possible? . . . a little afraid?
9555,"But almost before Harry had registered what he had seen, Filch"
9556,"had turned and shuffled away, muttering under his breath; Malfoy"
9557,had composed his face into a smile and was thanking Slughorn for
9558,"his generosity, and Snape’s face was smoothly inscrutable again."
9559,"“It’s nothing, nothing,” said Slughorn, waving away Malfoy’s"
9560,"thanks. “I did know your grandfather, after all. . . .”"
9561,"“He always spoke very highly of you, sir,” said Malfoy quickly."
9562,“Said you were the best potion-maker he’d ever known. . . .”
9563,Harry stared at Malfoy. It was not the sucking-up that intrigued
9564,him; he had watched Malfoy do that to Snape for a long time. It
9565,"was the fact that Malfoy did, after all, look a little ill. This was the"
9566,first time he had seen Malfoy close up for ages; he now saw that
9567,Malfoy had dark shadows under his eyes and a distinctly grayish
9568,tinge to his skin.
9569,"“I’d like a word with you, Draco,” said Snape suddenly."
9570,"“Oh, now, Severus,” said Slughorn, hiccuping again, “it’s Christ-"
9571,"mas, don’t be too hard —”"
9572,"“I’m his Head of House, and I shall decide how hard, or other-"
9573,"wise, to be,” said Snape curtly. “Follow me, Draco.”"
9574,"They left, Snape leading the way, Malfoy looking resentful."
9575,"Harry stood there for a moment, irresolute, then said, “I’ll be back"
9576,"in a bit, Luna — er — bathroom.”"

9579,"“All right,” she said cheerfully, and he thought he heard her, as"
9580,"he hurried off into the crowd, resume the subject of the Rotfang"
9581,"Conspiracy with Professor Trelawney, who seemed sincerely inter-"
9582,ested.
9583,"It was easy, once out of the party, to pull his Invisibility Cloak"
9584,"out of his pocket and throw it over himself, for the corridor was"
9585,quite deserted. What was more difficult was finding Snape and
9586,"Malfoy. Harry ran down the corridor, the noise of his feet masked"
9587,by the music and loud talk still issuing from Slughorn’s office be-
9588,hind him. Perhaps Snape had taken Malfoy to his office in the dun-
9589,geons . . . or perhaps he was escorting him back to the Slytherin
9590,common room. . . . Harry pressed his ear against door after door as
9591,"he dashed down the corridor until, with a great jolt of excitement,"
9592,he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corri-
9593,dor and heard voices.
9594,"“. . . cannot afford mistakes, Draco, because if you are ex-"
9595,pelled —”
9596,"“I didn’t have anything to do with it, all right?”"
9597,"“I hope you are telling the truth, because it was both clumsy and"
9598,foolish. Already you are suspected of having a hand in it.”
9599,"“Who suspects me?” said Malfoy angrily. “For the last time, I"
9600,"didn’t do it, okay? That Bell girl must’ve had an enemy no one"
9601,knows about — don’t look at me like that! I know what you’re do-
9602,"ing, I’m not stupid, but it won’t work — I can stop you!”"
9603,"There was a pause and then Snape said quietly, “Ah . . . Aunt"
9604,"Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency, I see. What thoughts"
9605,"are you trying to conceal from your master, Draco?”"
9606,"“I’m not trying to conceal anything from him, I just don’t want"
9607,you butting in!”
9608, 322   
9609,THE UNBREAKABLE VOW
9610,Harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole. . . .
9611,What had happened to make Malfoy speak to Snape like this —
9612,"Snape, toward whom he had always shown respect, even liking?"
9613,“So that is why you have been avoiding me this term? You have
9614,"feared my interference? You realize that, had anybody else failed to"
9615,"come to my office when I had told them repeatedly to be there,"
9616,Draco —”
9617,“So put me in detention! Report me to Dumbledore!” jeered
9618,Malfoy.
9619,"There was another pause. Then Snape said, “You know perfectly"
9620,well that I do not wish to do either of those things.”
9621,“You’d better stop telling me to come to your office then!”
9622,"“Listen to me,” said Snape, his voice so low now that Harry had"
9623,to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear. “I am trying
9624,to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made
9625,"the Unbreakable Vow, Draco —”"
9626,"“Looks like you’ll have to break it, then, because I don’t need"
9627,"your protection! It’s my job, he gave it to me and I’m doing it, I’ve"
9628,"got a plan and it’s going to work, it’s just taking a bit longer than I"
9629,thought it would!”
9630,“What is your plan?”
9631,“It’s none of your business!”
9632,"“If you tell me what you are trying to do, I can assist you —”"
9633,"“I’ve got all the assistance I need, thanks, I’m not alone!”"
9634,"“You were certainly alone tonight, which was foolish in the ex-"
9635,"treme, wandering the corridors without lookouts or backup, these"
9636,are elementary mistakes —”
9637,“I would’ve had Crabbe and Goyle with me if you hadn’t put
9638,them in detention!”
9639,  323  
9640,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9641,"“Keep your voice down!” spat Snape, for Malfoy’s voice had"
9642,risen excitedly. “If your friends Crabbe and Goyle intend to pass
9643,"their Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. this time around, they"
9644,will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres —”
9645,“What does it matter?” said Malfoy. “Defense Against the Dark
9646,"Arts — it’s all just a joke, isn’t it, an act? Like any of us need pro-"
9647,tecting against the Dark Arts —”
9648,"“It is an act that is crucial to success, Draco!” said Snape. “Where"
9649,"do you think I would have been all these years, if I had not known"
9650,"how to act? Now listen to me! You are being incautious, wandering"
9651,"around at night, getting yourself caught, and if you are placing"
9652,your reliance in assistants like Crabbe and Goyle —”
9653,"“They’re not the only ones, I’ve got other people on my side,"
9654,better people!”
9655,"“Then why not confide in me, and I can —”"
9656,“I know what you’re up to! You want to steal my glory!”
9657,"There was another pause, then Snape said coldly, “You are"
9658,speaking like a child. I quite understand that your father’s capture
9659,"and imprisonment has upset you, but —”"
9660,Harry had barely a second’s warning; he heard Malfoy’s footsteps
9661,on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just
9662,"as it burst open; Malfoy was striding away down the corridor, past"
9663,"the open door of Slughorn’s office, around the distant corner, and"
9664,out of sight.
9665,"Hardly daring to breathe, Harry remained crouched down as"
9666,Snape emerged slowly from the classroom. His expression unfath-
9667,"omable, he returned to the party. Harry remained on the floor, hid-"

9677,“I’m only checking!” said Ron. They were standing alone at the
9678,"Burrow’s kitchen sink, peeling a mountain of sprouts for Mrs."
9679,Weasley. Snow was drifting past the window in front of them.
9680,"“Yes, Snape was offering to help him!” said Harry. “He said he’d"
9681,"promised Malfoy’s mother to protect him, that he’d made an Un-"
9682,breakable Oath or something —”
9683,"“An Unbreakable Vow?” said Ron, looking stunned. “Nah, he"
9684,can’t have. . . . Are you sure?”
9685,"“Yes, I’m sure,” said Harry. “Why, what does it mean?”"
9686,"“Well, you can’t break an Unbreakable Vow. . . .”"

9691,"“You die,” said Ron simply. “Fred and George tried to get me to"
9692,"make one when I was about five. I nearly did too, I was holding"
9693,hands with Fred and everything when Dad found us. He went

9695,time I’ve ever seen Dad as angry as Mum. Fred reckons his left but-
9696,tock has never been the same since.”
9697,"“Yeah, well, passing over Fred’s left buttock —”"
9698,“I beg your pardon?” said Fred’s voice as the twins entered the
9699,kitchen.
9700,"“Aaah, George, look at this. They’re using knives and everything."
9701,Bless them.”
9702,"“I’ll be seventeen in two and a bit months’ time,” said Ron"

9711,"“And speaking of hitherto unsuspected skills, Ronald,” said"

9713,lady called — unless our information is faulty — Lavender Brown?”
9714,"Ron turned a little pink, but did not look displeased as he"
9715,turned back to the sprouts. “Mind your own business.”
9716,"“What a snappy retort,” said Fred. “I really don’t know how you"
9717,"think of them. No, what we wanted to know was . . . how did it"

9727,Mrs. Weasley entered the room just in time to see Ron throw the
9728,"sprout knife at Fred, who had turned it into a paper airplane with"
9729,one lazy flick of his wand.
9730,“Ron!” she said furiously. “Don’t you ever let me see you throw-
9731,ing knives again!”
9732,"“I won’t,” said Ron, “let you see,” he added under his breath, as"
9733,he turned back to the sprout mountain.
9734,"“Fred, George, I’m sorry, dears, but Remus is arriving tonight, so"
9735,Bill will have to squeeze in with you two.”
9736,"“No problem,” said George."
9737,"“Then, as Charlie isn’t coming home, that just leaves Harry and"

9739,“— that’ll make Ginny’s Christmas —” muttered Fred.

9747,“What are you two up to?” asked Ron. “Can’t you help us with

9749,too!”

9752,"“No, I don’t think we can do that,” said Fred seriously. “It’s very"

9754,makes you appreciate how difficult it is for Muggles and Squibs —”
9755,"“— and if you want people to help you, Ron,” added George,"

9760,"“Gits,” said Ron darkly, watching Fred and George setting off"
9761,across the snowy yard. “Would’ve only taken them ten seconds and
9762,then we could’ve gone too.”
9763,"“I couldn’t,” said Harry. “I promised Dumbledore I wouldn’t"

9765,"“Oh yeah,” said Ron. He peeled a few more sprouts and then"
9766,"said, “Are you going to tell Dumbledore what you heard Snape and"
9767,Malfoy saying to each other?”
9768,"“Yep,” said Harry. “I’m going to tell anyone who can put a stop"

9771,"“Pity you didn’t hear what Malfoy’s actually doing, though.”"
9772,"“I couldn’t have done, could I? That was the whole point, he was"

9785,though?”
9786,"“Yeah, I do!” said Ron hastily. “Seriously, I do! But they’re all"
9787,"convinced Snape’s in the Order, aren’t they?”"
9788,Harry said nothing. It had already occurred to him that this
9789,would be the most likely objection to his new evidence; he could
9790,"hear Hermione now: Obviously, Harry, he was pretending to offer"
9791,help so he could trick Malfoy into telling him what he’s doing. . . .
9792,"This was pure imagination, however, as he had had no opportu-"

9794,"from Slughorn’s parry before he returned to it, or so he had been"
9795,"informed by an irate McLaggen, and she had already gone to bed"
9796,by the time he returned to the common room. As he and Ron had
9797,"left for the Burrow early the next day, he had barely had time to"
9798,wish her a happy Christmas and to tell her that he had some very
9799,important news when they got back from the holidays. He was not
9800,"entirely sure that she had heard him, though; Ron and Lavender"
9801,had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal good-bye just behind him
9802,at the time.
9803,"Still, even Hermione would not be able to deny one thing: Mal-"

9807,"Harry did not get the chance to speak to Mr. Weasley, who was"
9808,"working very long hours at the Ministry, until Christmas Eve"
9809,night. The Weasleys and their guests were sitting in the living
9810,"room, which Ginny had decorated so lavishly that it was rather like"
9811,"sitting in a paper-chain explosion. Fred, George, Harry, and Ron"
9812,were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was

9817,stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its
9818,"back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever"

9820,They were all supposed to be listening to a Christmas broadcast
9821,"by Mrs. Weasley’s favorite singer, Celestina Warbeck, whose voice"
9822,"was warbling out of the large wooden wireless set. Fleur, who seemed"

9826,"ticularly jazzy number called “A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong"
9827,"Love,” Fred and George started a game of Exploding Snap with"
9828,"Ginny. Ron kept shooting Bill and Fleur covert looks, as though"
9829,"hoping to pick up tips. Meanwhile, Remus Lupin, who was thinner"
9830,"and more ragged-looking than ever, was sitting beside the fire, star-"
9831,ing into its depths as though he could not hear Celestina’s voice.
9832,"Oh, come and stir my cauldron,"
9833,"And if you do it right,"
9834,I’ll boil you up some hot strong love
9835,To keep you warm tonight.
9836,"“We danced to this when we were eighteen!” said Mrs. Weasley,"
9837,"wiping her eyes on her knitting. “Do you remember, Arthur?”"
9838,"“Mphf?” said Mr. Weasley, whose head had been nodding over"
9839,the satsuma he was peeling. “Oh yes . . . marvelous tune . . .”
9840,"With an effort, he sat up a little straighter and looked around at"
9841,"Harry, who was sitting next to him."
9842, 330  
9843,A VERY FROSTY
9844,CHRISTMAS
9845,"“Sorry about this,” he said, jerking his head toward the wireless"
9846,as Celestina broke into the chorus. “Be over soon.”
9847,"“No problem,” said Harry, grinning. “Has it been busy at the"
9848,Ministry?”
9849,"“Very,” said Mr. Weasley. “I wouldn’t mind if we were getting"
9850,"anywhere, but of the three arrests we’ve made in the last couple of"
9851,"months, I doubt that one of them is a genuine Death Eater — only"
9852,"don’t repeat that, Harry,” he added quickly, looking much more"
9853,awake all of a sudden.
9854,"“They’re not still holding Stan Shunpike, are they?” asked Harry."
9855,"“I’m afraid so,” said Mr. Weasley. “I know Dumbledore’s tried"
9856,"appealing directly to Scrimgeour about Stan. . . . I mean, anybody"
9857,who has actually interviewed him agrees that he’s about as much a
9858,Death Eater as this satsuma . . . but the top levels want to look as
9859,"though they’re making some progress, and ‘three arrests’ sounds"
9860,"better than ‘three mistaken arrests and releases’. . . but again, this is"
9861,all top secret. . . .”
9862,"“I won’t say anything,” said Harry. He hesitated for a moment,"
9863,wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say; as he
9864,"marshaled his thoughts, Celestina Warbeck began a ballad called"
9865,“You Charmed the Heart Right Out of Me.”
9866,"“Mr. Weasley, you know what I told you at the station when we"
9867,were setting off for school?”
9868,"“I checked, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley at once. “I went and"
9869,"searched the Malfoys’ house. There was nothing, either broken or"
9870,"whole, that shouldn’t have been there.”"
9871,"“Yeah, I know, I saw in the Prophet that you’d looked . . . but this"
9872,"is something different. . . . Well, something more . . .”"
9873,And he told Mr. Weasley everything he had overheard between
9874, 331  
9875,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9876,"Malfoy and Snape. As Harry spoke, he saw Lupin’s head turn a lit-"
9877,"tle toward him, taking in every word. When he had finished, there"
9878,"was silence, except for Celestina’s crooning."
9879,"Oh, my poor heart, where has it gone?"
9880,It’s left me for a spell . . .
9881,"“Has it occurred to you, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, “that Snape"
9882,was simply pretending — ?”
9883,"“Pretending to offer help, so that he could find out what Mal-"
9884,"foy’s up to?” said Harry quickly. “Yeah, I thought you’d say that."
9885,But how do we know?”
9886,"“It isn’t our business to know,” said Lupin unexpectedly. He had"
9887,turned his back on the fire now and faced Harry across Mr.
9888,"Weasley. “It’s Dumbledore’s business. Dumbledore trusts Severus,"
9889,and that ought to be good enough for all of us.”
9890,"“But,” said Harry, “just say — just say Dumbledore’s wrong"
9891,about Snape —”
9892,"“People have said it, many times. It comes down to whether or"
9893,"not you trust Dumbledore’s judgment. I do; therefore, I trust"
9894,Severus.”
9895,"“But Dumbledore can make mistakes,” argued Harry. “He says"
9896,it himself. And you” — he looked Lupin straight in the eye — “do
9897,you honestly like Snape?”
9898,"“I neither like nor dislike Severus,” said Lupin. “No, Harry, I am"
9899,"speaking the truth,” he added, as Harry pulled a skeptical expres-"
9900,"sion. “We shall never be bosom friends, perhaps; after all that hap-"
9901,"pened between James and Sirius and Severus, there is too much"
9902,bitterness there. But I do not forget that during the year I taught at
9903, 332    
9904,A VERY FROSTY
9905,CHRISTMAS
9906,"Hogwarts, Severus made the Wolfsbane Potion for me every"
9907,"month, made it perfectly, so that I did not have to suffer as I usu-"
9908,ally do at the full moon.”
9909,"“But he ‘accidentally’ let it slip that you’re a werewolf, so you had"
9910,to leave!” said Harry angrily.
9911,Lupin shrugged. “The news would have leaked out anyway. We
9912,"both know he wanted my job, but he could have wreaked much"
9913,worse damage on me by tampering with the potion. He kept me
9914,healthy. I must be grateful.”
9915,“Maybe he didn’t dare mess with the potion with Dumbledore
9916,watching him!” said Harry.
9917,"“You are determined to hate him, Harry,” said Lupin with a"
9918,"faint smile. “And I understand; with James as your father, with Sir-"
9919,"ius as your godfather, you have inherited an old prejudice. By all"
9920,"means tell Dumbledore what you have told Arthur and me, but do"
9921,not expect him to share your view of the matter; do not even expect
9922,him to be surprised by what you tell him. It might have been on
9923,Dumbledore’s orders that Severus questioned Draco.”
9924,. . . and now you’ve torn it quite apart
9925,I’ll thank you to give back my heart!
9926,"Celestina ended her song on a very long, high-pitched note and"
9927,"loud applause issued out of the wireless, which Mrs. Weasley joined"
9928,in with enthusiastically.
9929,"“Eez eet over?” said Fleur loudly. “Thank goodness, what an ’or-"
9930,rible —”
9931,"“Shall we have a nightcap, then?” asked Mr. Weasley loudly,"
9932,leaping to his feet. “Who wants eggnog?”
9933,  333  
9934,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9935,"“What have you been up to lately?” Harry asked Lupin, as Mr."
9936,"Weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog, and everybody else"
9937,stretched and broke into conversation.
9938,"“Oh, I’ve been underground,” said Lupin. “Almost literally."
9939,"That’s why I haven’t been able to write, Harry; sending letters to"
9940,you would have been something of a giveaway.”
9941,“What do you mean?”
9942,"“I’ve been living among my fellows, my equals,” said Lupin."
9943,"“Werewolves,” he added, at Harry’s look of incomprehension."
9944,“Nearly all of them are on Voldemort’s side. Dumbledore wanted a
9945,spy and here I was . . . ready-made.”
9946,"He sounded a little bitter, and perhaps realized it, for he smiled"
9947,"more warmly as he went on, “I am not complaining; it is necessary"
9948,"work and who can do it better than I? However, it has been diffi-"
9949,cult gaining their trust. I bear the unmistakable signs of having
9950,"tried to live among wizards, you see, whereas they have shunned"
9951,"normal society and live on the margins, stealing — and sometimes"
9952,killing — to eat.”
9953,“How come they like Voldemort?”
9954,"“They think that, under his rule, they will have a better life,”"
9955,said Lupin. “And it is hard to argue with Greyback out there. . . .”
9956,“Who’s Greyback?”
9957,“You haven’t heard of him?” Lupin’s hands closed convulsively in
9958,"his lap. “Fenrir Greyback is, perhaps, the most savage werewolf"
9959,alive today. He regards it as his mission in life to bite and to conta-
9960,minate as many people as possible; he wants to create enough were-
9961,wolves to overcome the wizards. Voldemort has promised him prey
9962,in return for his services. Greyback specializes in children. . . . Bite
9963,"them young, he says, and raise them away from their parents, raise"
9964, 334   
9965,A VERY FROSTY
9966,CHRISTMAS
9967,them to hate normal wizards. Voldemort has threatened to unleash
9968,him upon people’s sons and daughters; it is a threat that usually
9969,produces good results.”
9970,"Lupin paused and then said, “It was Greyback who bit me.”"
9971,"“What?” said Harry, astonished. “When — when you were a"
9972,"kid, you mean?”"
9973,"“Yes. My father had offended him. I did not know, for a very"
9974,"long time, the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me; I"
9975,"even felt pity for him, thinking that he had had no control, know-"
9976,ing by then how it felt to transform. But Greyback is not like that.
9977,"At the full moon, he positions himself close to victims, ensuring"
9978,that he is near enough to strike. He plans it all. And this is the man
9979,Voldemort is using to marshal the werewolves. I cannot pretend
9980,that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much
9981,headway against Greyback’s insistence that we werewolves deserve
9982,"blood, that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people.”"
9983,“But you are normal!” said Harry fiercely. “You’ve just got a — a
9984,problem —”
9985,Lupin burst out laughing. “Sometimes you remind me a lot of
9986,James. He called it my ‘furry little problem’ in company. Many
9987,people were under the impression that I owned a badly behaved
9988,rabbit.”
9989,He accepted a glass of eggnog from Mr. Weasley with a word of
9990,"thanks, looking slightly more cheerful. Harry, meanwhile, felt a"
9991,rush of excitement: This last mention of his father had reminded
9992,him that there was something he had been looking forward to ask-
9993,ing Lupin.
9994,“Have you ever heard of someone called the Half-Blood Prince?”
9995,“The Half-Blood what?”
9996,  335  
9997,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9998,"“Prince,” said Harry, watching him closely for signs of recogni-"
9999,tion.
10000,"“There are no Wizarding princes,” said Lupin, now smiling. “Is"
10001,this a title you’re thinking of adopting? I should have thought be-
10002,ing ‘the Chosen One’ would be enough.”
10003,“It’s nothing to do with me!” said Harry indignantly. “The Half-
10004,"Blood Prince is someone who used to go to Hogwarts, I’ve got his"
10005,"old Potions book. He wrote spells all over it, spells he invented."
10006,One of them was Levicorpus —”
10007,"“Oh, that one had a great vogue during my time at Hogwarts,”"
10008,said Lupin reminiscently. “There were a few months in my fifth
10009,year when you couldn’t move for being hoisted into the air by your
10010,ankle.”
10011,"“My dad used it,” said Harry. “I saw him in the Pensieve, he used"
10012,it on Snape.”
10013,"He tried to sound casual, as though this was a throwaway com-"
10014,"ment of no real importance, but he was not sure he had achieved"
10015,the right effect; Lupin’s smile was a little too understanding.
10016,"“Yes,” he said, “but he wasn’t the only one. As I say, it was very"
10017,popular. . . . You know how these spells come and go. . . .”
10018,"“But it sounds like it was invented while you were at school,”"
10019,Harry persisted.
10020,"“Not necessarily,” said Lupin. “Jinxes go in and out of fashion"
10021,like everything else.”
10022,"He looked into Harry’s face and then said quietly, “James was a"
10023,"pureblood, Harry, and I promise you, he never asked us to call him"
10024,‘Prince.’ ”
10025,"Abandoning pretense, Harry said, “And it wasn’t Sirius? Or you?”"
10026, 336   
10027,A VERY FROSTY
10028,CHRISTMAS
10029,“Definitely not.”
10030,"“Oh.” Harry stared into the fire. “I just thought — well, he’s"
10031,"helped me out a lot in Potions classes, the Prince has.”"
10032,"“How old is this book, Harry?”"
10033,"“I dunno, I’ve never checked.”"
10034,"“Well, perhaps that will give you some clue as to when the"
10035,"Prince was at Hogwarts,” said Lupin."
10036,"Shortly after this, Fleur decided to imitate Celestina singing “A"
10037,"Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love,” which was taken by everyone,"
10038,"once they had glimpsed Mrs. Weasley’s expression, to be the cue to"
10039,go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed all the way up to Ron’s attic
10040,"bedroom, where a camp bed had been added for Harry."
10041,"Ron fell asleep almost immediately, but Harry delved into his"
10042,trunk and pulled out his copy of Advanced Potion-Making before
10043,"getting into bed. There he turned its pages, searching, until he"
10044,"finally found, at the front of the book, the date that it had been pub-"
10045,"lished. It was nearly fifty years old. Neither his father, nor his father’s"
10046,"friends, had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago. Feeling disappointed,"
10047,"Harry threw the book back into his trunk, turned off the lamp, and"
10048,"rolled over, thinking of werewolves and Snape, Stan Shunpike and"
10049,"the Half-Blood Prince, and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of"
10050,creeping shadows and the cries of bitten children. . . .
10051,“She’s got to be joking. . . .”
10052,Harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the
10053,end of his bed. He put on his glasses and looked around; the tiny
10054,"window was almost completely obscured with snow and, in front"
10055,"of it, Ron was sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what ap-"
10056,peared to be a thick gold chain.
10057,  337 
10058,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
10059,“What’s that?” asked Harry.
10060,"“It’s from Lavender,” said Ron, sounding revolted. “She can’t"
10061,honestly think I’d wear . . .”
10062,Harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter. Dan-
10063,gling from the chain in large gold letters were the words:
10064,My Sweet heart
10065,"“Nice,” he said. “Classy. You should definitely wear it in front of"
10066,Fred and George.”
10067,"“If you tell them,” said Ron, shoving the necklace out of sight"
10068,"under his pillow, “I — I — I’ll —”"
10069,"“Stutter at me?” said Harry, grinning. “Come on, would I?”"
10070,"“How could she think I’d like something like that, though?”"
10071,"Ron demanded of thin air, looking rather shocked."
10072,"“Well, think back,” said Harry. “Have you ever let it slip that"
10073,you’d like to go out in public with the words ‘My Sweetheart’
10074,round your neck?”
10075,"“Well . . . we don’t really talk much,” said Ron. “It’s mainly . . .”"
10076,"“Snogging,” said Harry."
10077,"“Well, yeah,” said Ron. He hesitated a moment, then said, “Is"
10078,Hermione really going out with McLaggen?”
10079,"“I dunno,” said Harry. “They were at Slughorn’s party together,"
10080,but I don’t think it went that well.”
10081,Ron looked slightly more cheerful as he delved deeper into his
10082,stocking.
10083,Harry’s presents included a sweater with a large Golden Snitch
10084,"worked onto the front, hand-knitted by Mrs. Weasley, a large box"
10085,"of Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes products from the twins, and a"
10086,  338 
10087,A VERY FROSTY
10088,CHRISTMAS
10089,"slightly damp, moldy-smelling package that came with a label read-"
10090,"ing To Master, From Kreacher."
10091,Harry stared at it. “D’you reckon this is safe to open?” he asked.
10092,"“Can’t be anything dangerous, all our mail’s still being searched"
10093,"at the Ministry,” replied Ron, though he was eyeing the parcel"
10094,suspiciously.
10095,“I didn’t think of giving Kreacher anything. Do people usually
10096,"give their house-elves Christmas presents?” asked Harry, prodding"
10097,the parcel cautiously.
10098,"“Hermione would,” said Ron. “But let’s wait and see what it is"
10099,before you start feeling guilty.”
10100,"A moment later, Harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his"
10101,camp bed; the package contained a large number of maggots.
10102,"“Nice,” said Ron, roaring with laughter. “Very thoughtful.”"
10103,"“I’d rather have them than that necklace,” said Harry, which"
10104,sobered Ron up at once.
10105,Everybody was wearing new sweaters when they all sat down for
10106,"Christmas lunch, everyone except Fleur (on whom, it appeared,"
10107,Mrs. Weasley had not wanted to waste one) and Mrs. Weasley
10108,"herself, who was sporting a brand-new midnight blue witch’s hat"
10109,"glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamonds, and a spec-"
10110,tacular golden necklace.
10111,“Fred and George gave them to me! Aren’t they beautiful?”
10112,"“Well, we find we appreciate you more and more, Mum, now"
10113,"we’re washing our own socks,” said George, waving an airy hand."
10114,"“Parsnips, Remus?”"
10115,"“Harry, you’ve got a maggot in your hair,” said Ginny cheerfully,"
10116,leaning across the table to pick it out; Harry felt goose bumps erupt
10117,up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot.

10120,"“ ’Ow ’orrible,” said Fleur, with an affected little shudder."
10121,"“Yes, isn’t it?” said Ron. “Gravy, Fleur?”"
10122,"In his eagerness to help her, he knocked the gravy boat flying;"
10123,Bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned
10124,meekly to the boat.
10125,"“You are as bad as zat Tonks,” said Fleur to Ron, when she had"
10126,finished kissing Bill in thanks. “She is always knocking —”
10127,"“I invited dear Tonks to come along today,” said Mrs. Weasley,"
10128,setting down the carrots with unnecessary force and glaring at Fleur.
10129,"“But she wouldn’t come. Have you spoken to her lately, Remus?”"
10130,"“No, I haven’t been in contact with anybody very much,” said"
10131,"Lupin. “But Tonks has got her own family to go to, hasn’t she?”"
10132,"“Hmmm,” said Mrs. Weasley. “Maybe. I got the impression she"
10133,"was planning to spend Christmas alone, actually.”"
10134,"She gave Lupin an annoyed look, as though it was all his fault"
10135,"she was getting Fleur for a daughter-in-law instead of Tonks, but"
10136,"Harry, glancing across at Fleur, who was now feeding Bill bits of"
10137,"turkey off her own fork, thought that Mrs. Weasley was fighting a"
10138,"long-lost battle. He was, however, reminded of a question he had"
10139,"with regard to Tonks, and who better to ask than Lupin, the man"
10140,who knew all about Patronuses?
10141,"“Tonks’s Patronus has changed its form,” he told him. “Snape"
10142,said so anyway. I didn’t know that could happen. Why would your
10143,Patronus change?”
10144,Lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before
10145,"saying slowly, “Sometimes . . . a great shock . . . an emotional up-"
10146,heaval . . .”
10147,"“It looked big, and it had four legs,” said Harry, struck by a sud-"

10152,“Arthur!” said Mrs. Weasley suddenly. She had risen from her
10153,chair; her hand was pressed over her heart and she was staring out
10154,of the kitchen window. “Arthur — it’s Percy!”
10155,“What?”
10156,Mr. Weasley looked around. Everybody looked quickly at the
10157,"window; Ginny stood up for a better look. There, sure enough, was"
10158,"Percy Weasley, striding across the snowy yard, his horn-rimmed"
10159,"glasses glinting in the sunlight. He was not, however, alone."
10160,"“Arthur, he’s — he’s with the Minister!”"
10161,"And sure enough, the man Harry had seen in the Daily Prophet"
10162,"was following along in Percy’s wake, limping slightly, his mane of"
10163,graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow. Before any of
10164,"them could say anything, before Mr. and Mrs. Weasley could do"
10165,"more than exchange stunned looks, the back door opened and"
10166,there stood Percy.
10167,There was a moment’s painful silence. Then Percy said rather
10168,"stiffly, “Merry Christmas, Mother.”"
10169,"“Oh, Percy!” said Mrs. Weasley, and she threw herself into his"
10170,arms.
10171,"Rufus Scrimgeour paused in the doorway, leaning on his walk-"
10172,ing stick and smiling as he observed this affecting scene.
10173,"“You must forgive this intrusion,” he said, when Mrs. Weasley"
10174,"looked around at him, beaming and wiping her eyes. “Percy and I"
10175,"were in the vicinity — working, you know — and he couldn’t re-"
10176,sist dropping in and seeing you all.”
10177,But Percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of
10178,"the family. He stood, poker-straight and awkward-looking, and"
10179,"stared over everybody else’s heads. Mr. Weasley, Fred, and George"
10180,"were all observing him, stony-faced."
10181, 341  
10182,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
10183,"“Please, come in, sit down, Minister!” fluttered Mrs. Weasley,"
10184,"straightening her hat. “Have a little purkey, or some tooding. . . . I"
10185,mean —”
10186,"“No, no, my dear Molly,” said Scrimgeour. Harry guessed that"
10187,he had checked her name with Percy before they entered the house.
10188,"“I don’t want to intrude, wouldn’t be here at all if Percy hadn’t"
10189,wanted to see you all so badly. . . .”
10190,"“Oh, Perce!” said Mrs. Weasley tearfully, reaching up to kiss"
10191,him.
10192,"“. . . We’ve only looked in for five minutes, so I’ll have a stroll"
10193,"around the yard while you catch up with Percy. No, no, I assure"
10194,"you I don’t want to butt in! Well, if anybody cared to show me your"
10195,"charming garden . . . Ah, that young man’s finished, why doesn’t"
10196,he take a stroll with me?”
10197,The atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly. Every-
10198,body looked from Scrimgeour to Harry. Nobody seemed to find
10199,Scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know Harry’s name convinc-
10200,"ing, or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the"
10201,"Minister around the garden when Ginny, Fleur, and George also"
10202,had clean plates.
10203,"“Yeah, all right,” said Harry into the silence."
10204,He was not fooled; for all Scrimgeour’s talk that they had just
10205,"been in the area, that Percy wanted to look up his family, this must"
10206,"be the real reason that they had come, so that Scrimgeour could"
10207,speak to Harry alone.
10208,"“It’s fine,” he said quietly, as he passed Lupin, who had half risen"
10209,"from his chair. “Fine,” he added, as Mr. Weasley opened his mouth"
10210,to speak.
10211,"“Wonderful!” said Scrimgeour, standing back to let Harry pass"

10216,"garden, and Percy and I’ll be off. Carry on, everyone!”"
10217,"Harry walked across the yard toward the Weasleys’ overgrown,"
10218,"snow-covered garden, Scrimgeour limping slightly at his side. He"
10219,"had, Harry knew, been Head of the Auror office; he looked tough"
10220,"and battle-scarred, very different from portly Fudge in his bowler"
10221,hat.
10222,"“Charming,” said Scrimgeour, stopping at the garden fence and"
10223,looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plants.
10224,“Charming.”
10225,Harry said nothing. He could tell that Scrimgeour was watching
10226,him.
10227,"“I’ve wanted to meet you for a very long time,” said Scrimgeour,"
10228,after a few moments. “Did you know that?”
10229,"“No,” said Harry truthfully."
10230,"“Oh yes, for a very long time. But Dumbledore has been very"
10231,"protective of you,” said Scrimgeour. “Natural, of course, natural,"
10232,after what you’ve been through. . . . Especially what happened at
10233,the Ministry . . .”
10234,"He waited for Harry to say something, but Harry did not oblige,"
10235,"so he went on, “I have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you"
10236,"ever since I gained office, but Dumbledore has — most under-"
10237,"standably, as I say — prevented this.”"
10238,"Still, Harry said nothing, waiting."
10239,"“The rumors that have flown around!” said Scrimgeour. “Well,"
10240,"of course, we both know how these stories get distorted . . . all these"
10241,whispers of a prophecy . . . of you being ‘the Chosen One’. . .”
10242,"They were getting near it now, Harry thought, the reason Scrim-"
10243,geour was here.
10244, 343   
10245,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
10246,“. . . I assume that Dumbledore has discussed these matters with
10247,you?”
10248,"Harry deliberated, wondering whether he ought to lie or not."
10249,"He looked at the little gnome prints all around the flowerbeds, and"
10250,the scuffed-up patch that marked the spot where Fred had caught
10251,the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the Christmas tree.
10252,"Finally, he decided on the truth . . . or a bit of it."
10253,"“Yeah, we’ve discussed it.”"
10254,"“Have you, have you . . .” said Scrimgeour. Harry could see, out"
10255,"of the corner of his eye, Scrimgeour squinting at him, so he pre-"
10256,tended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked its
10257,head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron. “And what has
10258,"Dumbledore told you, Harry?”"
10259,"“Sorry, but that’s between us,” said Harry. He kept his voice as"
10260,"pleasant as he could, and Scrimgeour’s tone, too, was light and"
10261,"friendly as he said, “Oh, of course, if it’s a question of confidences,"
10262,"I wouldn’t want you to divulge . . . no, no . . . and in any case, does"
10263,it really matter whether you are ‘the Chosen One’ or not?”
10264,Harry had to mull that one over for a few seconds before re-
10265,"sponding. “I don’t really know what you mean, Minister.”"
10266,"“Well, of course, to you it will matter enormously,” said Scrim-"
10267,geour with a laugh. “But to the Wizarding community at large . . .
10268,"it’s all perception, isn’t it? It’s what people believe that’s important.”"
10269,"Harry said nothing. He thought he saw, dimly, where they were"
10270,"heading, but he was not going to help Scrimgeour get there. The"
10271,gnome under the rhododendron was now digging for worms at its
10272,"roots, and Harry kept his eyes fixed upon it."
10273,"“People believe you are ‘the Chosen One,’ you see,” said Scrim-"
10274,"geour. “They think you quite the hero — which, of course, you"

10278,"are, Harry, chosen or not! How many times have you faced He-"
10279,"Who-Must-Not-Be-Named now? Well, anyway,” he pressed on,"
10280,"without waiting for a reply, “the point is, you are a symbol of hope"
10281,"for many, Harry. The idea that there is somebody out there who"
10282,"might be able, who might even be destined, to destroy He-Who-"
10283,"Must-Not-Be-Named — well, naturally, it gives people a lift. And"
10284,"I can’t help but feel that, once you realize this, you might consider"
10285,"it, well, almost a duty, to stand alongside the Ministry, and give"
10286,everyone a boost.”
10287,The gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm. It was now
10288,"tugging very hard on it, trying to get it out of the frozen ground."
10289,"Harry was silent so long that Scrimgeour said, looking from Harry"
10290,"to the gnome, “Funny little chaps, aren’t they? But what say you,"
10291,Harry?”
10292,"“I don’t exactly understand what you want,” said Harry slowly."
10293,“ ‘Stand alongside the Ministry’ . . . What does that mean?”
10294,"“Oh, well, nothing at all onerous, I assure you,” said Scrim-"
10295,geour. “If you were to be seen popping in and out of the Ministry
10296,"from time to time, for instance, that would give the right impres-"
10297,"sion. And of course, while you were there, you would have ample"
10298,"opportunity to speak to Gawain Robards, my successor as Head of"
10299,the Auror office. Dolores Umbridge has told me that you cherish
10300,"an ambition to become an Auror. Well, that could be arranged very"
10301,easily. . . .”
10302,Harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach: So Dolores
10303,"Umbridge was still at the Ministry, was she?"
10304,"“So basically,” he said, as though he just wanted to clarify a few"
10305,"points, “you’d like to give the impression that I’m working for the"
10306,Ministry?”
10307, 345  
10308,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
10309,"“It would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved,"
10310,"Harry,” said Scrimgeour, sounding relieved that Harry had cot-"
10311,"toned on so quickly. “ ‘The Chosen One,’ you know . . . It’s all"
10312,"about giving people hope, the feeling that exciting things are hap-"
10313,pening. . . .”
10314,"“But if I keep running in and out of the Ministry,” said Harry,"
10315,"still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly, “won’t that seem as"
10316,though I approve of what the Ministry’s up to?”
10317,"“Well,” said Scrimgeour, frowning slightly, “well, yes, that’s"
10318,partly why we’d like —”
10319,"“No, I don’t think that’ll work,” said Harry pleasantly. “You see,"
10320,I don’t like some of the things the Ministry’s doing. Locking up
10321,"Stan Shunpike, for instance.”"
10322,Scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hard-
10323,"ened instantly. “I would not expect you to understand,” he said,"
10324,and he was not as successful at keeping anger out of his voice as
10325,"Harry had been. “These are dangerous times, and certain measures"
10326,need to be taken. You are sixteen years old —”
10327,"“Dumbledore’s a lot older than sixteen, and he doesn’t think"
10328,"Stan should be in Azkaban either,” said Harry. “You’re making Stan"
10329,"a scapegoat, just like you want to make me a mascot.”"
10330,"They looked at each other, long and hard. Finally Scrimgeour"
10331,"said, with no pretense at warmth, “I see. You prefer — like your"
10332,"hero, Dumbledore — to disassociate yourself from the Ministry?”"
10333,"“I don’t want to be used,” said Harry."
10334,“Some would say it’s your duty to be used by the Ministry!”
10335,"“Yeah, and others might say it’s your duty to check that people"
10336,"really are Death Eaters before you chuck them in prison,” said"
10337,"Harry, his temper rising now. “You’re doing what Barty Crouch"
10338, 346   
10339,A VERY FROSTY
10340,CHRISTMAS
10341,"did. You never get it right, you people, do you? Either we’ve got"
10342,"Fudge, pretending everything’s lovely while people get murdered"
10343,"right under his nose, or we’ve got you, chucking the wrong people"
10344,into jail and trying to pretend you’ve got ‘the Chosen One’ work-
10345,ing for you!”
10346,“So you’re not ‘the Chosen One’?” said Scrimgeour.
10347,"“I thought you said it didn’t matter either way?” said Harry, with"
10348,a bitter laugh. “Not to you anyway.”
10349,"“I shouldn’t have said that,” said Scrimgeour quickly. “It was"
10350,tactless —”
10351,"“No, it was honest,” said Harry. “One of the only honest things"
10352,"you’ve said to me. You don’t care whether I live or die, but you do"
10353,care that I help you convince everyone you’re winning the war
10354,"against Voldemort. I haven’t forgotten, Minister. . . .”"
10355,"He raised his right fist. There, shining white on the back of his"
10356,"cold hand, were the scars which Dolores Umbridge had forced him"
10357,to carve into his own flesh: I must not tell lies.
10358,“I don’t remember you rushing to my defense when I was trying
10359,to tell everyone Voldemort was back. The Ministry wasn’t so keen
10360,to be pals last year.”
10361,They stood in silence as icy as the ground beneath their feet. The
10362,gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and was now
10363,"sucking on it happily, leaning against the bottommost branches of"
10364,the rhododendron bush.
10365,“What is Dumbledore up to?” said Scrimgeour brusquely.
10366,“Where does he go when he is absent from Hogwarts?”
10367,"“No idea,” said Harry."
10368,"“And you wouldn’t tell me if you knew,” said Scrimgeour,"
10369,“would you?”
10370, 347   
10371,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
10372,"“No, I wouldn’t,” said Harry."
10373,"“Well, then, I shall have to see whether I can’t find out by other"
10374,means.”
10375,"“You can try,” said Harry indifferently. “But you seem cleverer"
10376,"than Fudge, so I’d have thought you’d have learned from his mis-"
10377,takes. He tried interfering at Hogwarts. You might have noticed
10378,"he’s not Minister anymore, but Dumbledore’s still headmaster. I’d"
10379,"leave Dumbledore alone, if I were you.”"
10380,There was a long pause.
10381,"“Well, it is clear to me that he has done a very good job on you,”"
10382,"said Scrimgeour, his eyes cold and hard behind his wire-rimmed"
10383,"glasses. “Dumbledore’s man through and through, aren’t you, Potter?”"
10384,"“Yeah, I am,” said Harry. “Glad we straightened that out.”"
10385,"And turning his back on the Minister of Magic, he strode back"
10386,toward the house.

10390,"L     ate in the afternoon, a few days after New Year, Harry, Ron,"
10391,and Ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to Hog-
10392,warts. The Ministry had arranged this one-off connection to the
10393,Floo Network to return students quickly and safely to the school.
10394,"Only Mrs. Weasley was there to say good-bye, as Mr. Weasley,"
10395,"Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur were all at work. Mrs. Weasley dis-"
10396,"solved into tears at the moment of parting. Admittedly, it took very"
10397,little to set her off lately; she had been crying on and off ever since
10398,Percy had stormed from the house on Christmas Day with his
10399,"glasses splattered with mashed parsnip (for which Fred, George,"
10400,and Ginny all claimed credit).
10401,"“Don’t cry, Mum,” said Ginny, patting her on the back as Mrs."
10402,Weasley sobbed into her shoulder. “It’s okay. . . .”
10403,"“Yeah, don’t worry about us,” said Ron, permitting his mother"
10404,"to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek, “or about Percy. He’s such a"
10405,"prat, it’s not really a loss, is it?”"
10406, 349 
10407,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10408,Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever as she enfolded Harry in
10409,her arms.
10410,“Promise me you’ll look after yourself. . . . Stay out of trou-
10411,ble. . . .”
10412,"“I always do, Mrs. Weasley,” said Harry. “I like a quiet life, you"
10413,know me.”
10414,"She gave a watery chuckle and stood back. “Be good, then, all of"
10415,you. . . .”
10416,Harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted “Hogwarts!”
10417,He had one last fleeting view of the Weasleys’ kitchen and Mrs.
10418,Weasley’s tearful face before the flames engulfed him; spinning very
10419,"fast, he caught blurred glimpses of other Wizarding rooms, which"
10420,were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look; then
10421,"he was slowing down, finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in"
10422,Professor McGonagall’s office. She barely glanced up from her
10423,work as he clambered out over the grate.
10424,"“Evening, Potter. Try not to get too much ash on the carpet.”"
10425,"“No, Professor.”"
10426,Harry straightened his glasses and flattened his hair as Ron came
10427,"spinning into view. When Ginny had arrived, all three of them"
10428,trooped out of McGonagall’s office and off toward Gryffindor
10429,Tower. Harry glanced out of the corridor windows as they passed;
10430,the sun was already sinking over grounds carpeted in deeper snow
10431,"than had lain over the Burrow garden. In the distance, he could see"
10432,Hagrid feeding Buckbeak in front of his cabin.
10433,"“Baubles,” said Ron confidently, when they reached the Fat"
10434,"Lady, who was looking rather paler than usual and winced at his"
10435,loud voice.
10436,"“No,” she said."

10439,"“What d’you mean, ‘no’?”"
10440,"“There is a new password,” she said. “And please don’t shout.”"
10441,"“But we’ve been away, how’re we supposed to — ?”"
10442,“Harry! Ginny!”
10443,"Hermione was hurrying toward them, very pink-faced and wear-"
10444,"ing a cloak, hat, and gloves."
10445,"“I got back a couple of hours ago, I’ve just been down to visit"
10446,"Hagrid and Buck — I mean Witherwings,” she said breathlessly."
10447,“Did you have a good Christmas?”
10448,"“Yeah,” said Ron at once, “pretty eventful, Rufus Scrim —”"
10449,"“I’ve got something for you, Harry,” said Hermione, neither"
10450,"looking at Ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him. “Oh,"
10451,hang on — password. Abstinence.”
10452,"“Precisely,” said the Fat Lady in a feeble voice, and swung for-"
10453,ward to reveal the portrait hole.
10454,“What’s up with her?” asked Harry.
10455,"“Overindulged over Christmas, apparently,” said Hermione,"
10456,rolling her eyes as she led the way into the packed common room.
10457,“She and her friend Violet drank their way through all the wine
10458,in that picture of drunk monks down by the Charms corridor.
10459,Anyway . . .”
10460,"She rummaged in her pocket for a moment, then pulled out a"
10461,scroll of parchment with Dumbledore’s writing on it.
10462,"“Great,” said Harry, unrolling it at once to discover that his next"
10463,lesson with Dumbledore was scheduled for the following night.
10464,“I’ve got loads to tell him — and you. Let’s sit down —”
10465,But at that moment there was a loud squeal of “Won-Won!” and
10466,Lavender Brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself
10467,into Ron’s arms. Several onlookers sniggered; Hermione gave a
10468, 351  
10469,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10470,"tinkling laugh and said, “There’s a table over here. . . . Coming,"
10471,Ginny?”
10472,"“No, thanks, I said I’d meet Dean,” said Ginny, though Harry"
10473,could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic.
10474,Leaving Ron and Lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling
10475,"match, Harry led Hermione over to the spare table."
10476,“So how was your Christmas?”
10477,"“Oh, fine,” she shrugged. “Nothing special. How was it at Won-"
10478,Won’s?”
10479,"“I’ll tell you in a minute,” said Harry. “Look, Hermione, can’t"
10480,you — ?”
10481,"“No, I can’t,” she said flatly. “So don’t even ask.”"
10482,"“I thought maybe, you know, over Christmas —”"
10483,“It was the Fat Lady who drank a vat of five-hundred-year-old
10484,"wine, Harry, not me. So what was this important news you wanted"
10485,to tell me?”
10486,"She looked too fierce to argue with at that moment, so Harry"
10487,dropped the subject of Ron and recounted all that he had overheard
10488,"between Malfoy and Snape. When he had finished, Hermione sat in"
10489,"thought for a moment and then said, “Don’t you think — ?”"
10490,“— he was pretending to offer help so that he could trick Mal-
10491,foy into telling him what he’s doing?”
10492,"“Well, yes,” said Hermione."
10493,"“Ron’s dad and Lupin think so,” Harry said grudgingly. “But"
10494,"this definitely proves Malfoy’s planning something, you can’t deny"
10495,that.”
10496,"“No, I can’t,” she answered slowly."
10497,"“And he’s acting on Voldemort’s orders, just like I said!”"
10498, 352  
10499,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10500,“Hmm . . . did either of them actually mention Voldemort’s
10501,name?”
10502,"Harry frowned, trying to remember. “I’m not sure . . . Snape"
10503,"definitely said ‘your master,’ and who else would that be?”"
10504,"“I don’t know,” said Hermione, biting her lip. “Maybe his"
10505,father?”
10506,"She stared across the room, apparently lost in thought, not even"
10507,noticing Lavender tickling Ron. “How’s Lupin?”
10508,"“Not great,” said Harry, and he told her all about Lupin’s mission"
10509,among the werewolves and the difficulties he was facing. “Have you
10510,heard of this Fenrir Greyback?”
10511,"“Yes, I have!” said Hermione, sounding startled. “And so have"
10512,"you, Harry!”"
10513,"“When, History of Magic? You know full well I never lis-"
10514,tened . . .”
10515,"“No, no, not History of Magic — Malfoy threatened Borgin"
10516,"with him!” said Hermione. “Back in Knockturn Alley, don’t you re-"
10517,member? He told Borgin that Greyback was an old family friend
10518,and that he’d be checking up on Borgin’s progress!”
10519,Harry gaped at her. “I forgot! But this proves Malfoy’s a Death
10520,"Eater, how else could he be in contact with Greyback and telling"
10521,him what to do?”
10522,"“It is pretty suspicious,” breathed Hermione. “Unless . . .”"
10523,"“Oh, come on,” said Harry in exasperation, “you can’t get round"
10524,this one!”
10525,“Well . . . there is the possibility it was an empty threat.”
10526,"“You’re unbelievable, you are,” said Harry, shaking his head."
10527,"“We’ll see who’s right. . . . You’ll be eating your words, Hermione,"
10528, 353    
10529,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10530,"just like the Ministry. Oh yeah, I had a row with Rufus Scrimgeour"
10531,as well. . . .”
10532,And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them
10533,"abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought"
10534,"that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year,"
10535,they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now.
10536,The new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for
10537,the sixth years: a large sign had been pinned to the common room
10538,notice boards overnight.
10539,APPARITION LESSONS
10540,"If you are seventeen years of age, or will turn seventeen on"
10541,"or before the 31st August next, you are eligible for a"

10544,you would like to participate. Cost: 12 Galleons.
10545,Harry and Ron joined the crowd that was jostling around the
10546,notice and taking it in turns to write their names at the bottom.
10547,Ron was just taking out his quill to sign after Hermione when
10548,"Lavender crept up behind him, slipped her hands over his eyes, and"
10549,"trilled, “Guess who, Won-Won?” Harry turned to see Hermione"
10550,"stalking off; he caught up with her, having no wish to stay behind"
10551,"with Ron and Lavender, but to his surprise, Ron caught up with"
10552,"them only a little way beyond the portrait hole, his ears bright red"
10553,"and his expression disgruntled. Without a word, Hermione sped"
10554,up to walk with Neville.
10555,"“So — Apparition,” said Ron, his tone making it perfectly plain"
10556, 354   
10557,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10558,that Harry was not to mention what had just happened. “Should
10559,"be a laugh, eh?”"
10560,"“I dunno,” said Harry. “Maybe it’s better when you do it your-"
10561,"self, I didn’t enjoy it much when Dumbledore took me along for"
10562,the ride.”
10563,“I forgot you’d already done it. . . . I’d better pass my test first

10565,"“Charlie failed, though, didn’t he?”"
10566,"“Yeah, but Charlie’s bigger than me” — Ron held his arms out"
10567,from his body as though he was a gorilla — “so Fred and George
10568,didn’t go on about it much . . . not to his face anyway . . .”
10569,“When can we take the actual test?”
10570,“Soon as we’re seventeen. That’s only March for me!”
10571,"“Yeah, but you wouldn’t be able to Apparate in here, not in the"
10572,castle . . .”
10573,"“Not the point, is it? Everyone would know I could Apparate if I"
10574,wanted.”
10575,Ron was not the only one to be excited at the prospect of Ap-
10576,parition. All that day there was much talk about the forthcoming
10577,lessons; a great deal of store was set by being able to vanish and
10578,reappear at will.
10579,“How cool will it be when we can just —” Seamus clicked his

10586, 355   
10587,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10588,a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor
10589,Flitwick flat on his face.
10590,"“Harry’s already Apparated,” Ron told a slightly abashed Sea-"
10591,"mus, after Professor Flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of"
10592,"his wand and set Seamus lines: “I am a wizard, not a baboon bran-"
10593,dishing a stick.” “Dum — er — someone took him. Side-Along-
10594,"Apparition, you know.”"
10595,"“Whoa!” whispered Seamus, and he, Dean, and Neville put their"
10596,heads a little closer to hear what Apparition felt like. For the rest of
10597,"the day, Harry was besieged with requests from the other sixth"
10598,years to describe the sensation of Apparition. All of them seemed
10599,"awed, rather than put off, when he told them how uncomfortable"
10600,"it was, and he was still answering detailed questions at ten to eight"
10601,"that evening, when he was forced to lie and say that he needed to"
10602,"return a book to the library, so as to escape in time for his lesson"
10603,with Dumbledore.
10604,"The lamps in Dumbledore’s office were lit, the portraits of pre-"
10605,"vious headmasters were snoring gently in their frames, and the Pen-"
10606,sieve was ready upon the desk once more. Dumbledore’s hands lay
10607,"on either side of it, the right one as blackened and burnt-looking as"
10608,"ever. It did not seem to have healed at all and Harry wondered, for"
10609,"perhaps the hundredth time, what had caused such a distinctive in-"
10610,"jury, but did not ask; Dumbledore had said that he would know"
10611,"eventually and there was, in any case, another subject he wanted to"
10612,discuss. But before Harry could say anything about Snape and
10613,"Malfoy, Dumbledore spoke."
10614,“I hear that you met the Minister of Magic over Christmas?”
10615,"“Yes,” said Harry. “He’s not very happy with me.”"
10616, 356   
10617,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10618,"“No,” sighed Dumbledore. “He is not very happy with me"
10619,"either. We must try not to sink beneath our anguish, Harry, but"
10620,battle on.”
10621,Harry grinned.
10622,“He wanted me to tell the Wizarding community that the Min-
10623,istry’s doing a wonderful job.”
10624,Dumbledore smiled.
10625,"“It was Fudge’s idea originally, you know. During his last days in"
10626,"office, when he was trying desperately to cling to his post, he"
10627,"sought a meeting with you, hoping that you would give him your"
10628,support —”
10629,“After everything Fudge did last year?” said Harry angrily. “After
10630,Umbridge?”
10631,"“I told Cornelius there was no chance of it, but the idea did not"
10632,die when he left office. Within hours of Scrimgeour’s appointment
10633,we met and he demanded that I arrange a meeting with you —”
10634,“So that’s why you argued!” Harry blurted out. “It was in the
10635,Daily Prophet.”
10636,"“The Prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally,” said"
10637,"Dumbledore, “if only accidentally. Yes, that was why we argued."
10638,"Well, it appears that Rufus found a way to corner you at last.”"
10639,“He accused me of being ‘Dumbledore’s man through and
10640,through.’ ”
10641,“How very rude of him.”
10642,“I told him I was.”
10643,Dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it
10644,"again. Behind Harry, Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musi-"
10645,"cal cry. To Harry’s intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized"
10646,  357  
10647,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10648,"that Dumbledore’s bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and"
10649,"stared hastily at his own knees. When Dumbledore spoke, how-"
10650,"ever, his voice was quite steady."
10651,"“I am very touched, Harry.”"
10652,“Scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you’re not at
10653,"Hogwarts,” said Harry, still looking fixedly at his knees."
10654,"“Yes, he is very nosy about that,” said Dumbledore, now sound-"
10655,"ing cheerful, and Harry thought it safe to look up again. “He has"
10656,"even attempted to have me followed. Amusing, really. He set"
10657,Dawlish to tail me. It wasn’t kind. I have already been forced to jinx
10658,Dawlish once; I did it again with the greatest regret.”
10659,"“So they still don’t know where you go?” asked Harry, hoping for"
10660,"more information on this intriguing subject, but Dumbledore"
10661,merely smiled over the top of his half-moon spectacles.
10662,"“No, they don’t, and the time is not quite right for you to know"
10663,"either. Now, I suggest we press on, unless there’s anything else — ?”"
10664,"“There is, actually, sir,” said Harry. “It’s about Malfoy and"
10665,Snape.”
10666,"“Professor Snape, Harry.”"
10667,"“Yes, sir. I overheard them during Professor Slughorn’s party . . ."
10668,"well, I followed them, actually. . . .”"
10669,Dumbledore listened to Harry’s story with an impassive face.
10670,"When Harry had finished he did not speak for a few moments,"
10671,"then said, “Thank you for telling me this, Harry, but I suggest that"
10672,you put it out of your mind. I do not think that it is of great
10673,importance.”
10674,“Not of great importance?” repeated Harry incredulously. “Pro-
10675,"fessor, did you understand — ?”"
10676,"“Yes, Harry, blessed as I am with extraordinary brainpower, I"
10677, 358    
10678,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10679,"understood everything you told me,” said Dumbledore, a little"
10680,sharply. “I think you might even consider the possibility that I un-
10681,"derstood more than you did. Again, I am glad that you have con-"
10682,"fided in me, but let me reassure you that you have not told me"
10683,anything that causes me disquiet.”
10684,"Harry sat in seething silence, glaring at Dumbledore. What was"
10685,going on? Did this mean that Dumbledore had indeed ordered
10686,"Snape to find out what Malfoy was doing, in which case he had"
10687,already heard everything Harry had just told him from Snape? Or
10688,"was he really worried by what he had heard, but pretending not"
10689,to be?
10690,"“So, sir,” said Harry, in what he hoped was a polite, calm voice,"
10691,“you definitely still trust — ?”
10692,"“I have been tolerant enough to answer that question already,”"
10693,"said Dumbledore, but he did not sound very tolerant anymore."
10694,“My answer has not changed.”
10695,"“I should think not,” said a snide voice; Phineas Nigellus was ev-"
10696,idently only pretending to be asleep. Dumbledore ignored him.
10697,"“And now, Harry, I must insist that we press on. I have more im-"
10698,portant things to discuss with you this evening.”
10699,Harry sat there feeling mutinous. How would it be if he refused
10700,"to permit the change of subject, if he insisted upon arguing the case"
10701,"against Malfoy? As though he had read Harry’s mind, Dumbledore"
10702,shook his head.
10703,"“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of"
10704,friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more
10705,important than anything the other might have to contribute!”
10706,"“I don’t think what you’ve got to say is unimportant, sir,” said"
10707,Harry stiffly.
10708,  359  
10709,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10710,"“Well, you are quite right, because it is not,” said Dumbledore"
10711,"briskly. “I have two more memories to show you this evening, both"
10712,"obtained with enormous difficulty, and the second of them is, I"
10713,"think, the most important I have collected.”"
10714,Harry did not say anything to this; he still felt angry at the re-
10715,"ception his confidences had received, but could not see what was to"
10716,be gained by arguing further.
10717,"“So,” said Dumbledore, in a ringing voice, “we meet this eve-"
10718,"ning to continue the tale of Tom Riddle, whom we left last lesson"
10719,poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts. You will remem-
10720,"ber how excited he was to hear that he was a wizard, that he refused"
10721,"my company on a trip to Diagon Alley, and that I, in turn, warned"
10722,him against continued thievery when he arrived at school.
10723,"“Well, the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom"
10724,"Riddle, a quiet boy in his secondhand robes, who lined up with the"
10725,other first years to be sorted. He was placed in Slytherin House al-
10726,"most the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head,” contin-"
10727,"ued Dumbledore, waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over"
10728,"his head where the Sorting Hat sat, ancient and unmoving. “How"
10729,soon Riddle learned that the famous founder of the House could
10730,"talk to snakes, I do not know — perhaps that very evening. The"
10731,knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of
10732,self-importance.
10733,"“However, if he was frightening or impressing fellow Slytherins"
10734,"with displays of Parseltongue in their common room, no hint of it"
10735,reached the staff. He showed no sign of outward arrogance or ag-
10736,gression at all. As an unusually talented and very good-looking or-
10737,"phan, he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff"
10738,"almost from the moment of his arrival. He seemed polite, quiet,"
10739, 360  
10740,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10741,and thirsty for knowledge. Nearly all were most favorably im-
10742,pressed by him.”
10743,"“Didn’t you tell them, sir, what he’d been like when you met him"
10744,at the orphanage?” asked Harry.
10745,"“No, I did not. Though he had shown no hint of remorse, it was"
10746,possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and was
10747,resolved to turn over a fresh leaf. I chose to give him that chance.”
10748,"Dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at Harry, who had"
10749,"opened his mouth to speak. Here, again, was Dumbledore’s ten-"
10750,dency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they
10751,did not deserve it! But then Harry remembered something. . . .
10752,"“But you didn’t really trust him, sir, did you? He told me . . . the"
10753,"Riddle who came out of that diary said, ‘Dumbledore never"
10754,seemed to like me as much as the other teachers did.’ ”
10755,“Let us say that I did not take it for granted that he was trust-
10756,"worthy,” said Dumbledore. “I had, as I have already indicated, re-"
10757,"solved to keep a close eye upon him, and so I did. I cannot pretend"
10758,that I gleaned a great deal from my observations at first. He was
10759,"very guarded with me; he felt, I am sure, that in the thrill of dis-"
10760,covering his true identity he had told me a little too much. He was
10761,"careful never to reveal as much again, but he could not take back"
10762,"what he had let slip in his excitement, nor what Mrs. Cole had con-"
10763,"fided in me. However, he had the sense never to try and charm me"
10764,as he charmed so many of my colleagues.
10765,"“As he moved up the school, he gathered about him a group"
10766,"of dedicated friends; I call them that, for want of a better term,"
10767,"although as I have already indicated, Riddle undoubtedly felt no"
10768,affection for any of them. This group had a kind of dark glamour
10769,within the castle. They were a motley collection; a mixture of the
10770,  361  
10771,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10772,"weak seeking protection, the ambitious seeking some shared glory,"
10773,and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them
10774,"more refined forms of cruelty. In other words, they were the fore-"
10775,"runners of the Death Eaters, and indeed some of them became the"
10776,first Death Eaters after leaving Hogwarts.
10777,"“Rigidly controlled by Riddle, they were never detected in open"
10778,"wrongdoing, although their seven years at Hogwarts were marked"
10779,by a number of nasty incidents to which they were never satisfac-
10780,"torily linked, the most serious of which was, of course, the opening"
10781,"of the Chamber of Secrets, which resulted in the death of a girl. As"
10782,"you know, Hagrid was wrongly accused of that crime."
10783,“I have not been able to find many memories of Riddle at Hog-
10784,"warts,” said Dumbledore, placing his withered hand on the Pen-"
10785,sieve. “Few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him;
10786,"they are too terrified. What I know, I found out after he had left"
10787,"Hogwarts, after much painstaking effort, after tracing those few"
10788,"who could be tricked into speaking, after searching old records and"
10789,questioning Muggle and wizard witnesses alike.
10790,“Those whom I could persuade to talk told me that Riddle was
10791,"obsessed with his parentage. This is understandable, of course; he"
10792,had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how
10793,he came to be there. It seems that he searched in vain for some trace
10794,"of Tom Riddle senior on the shields in the trophy room, on the"
10795,"lists of prefects in the old school records, even in the books of Wiz-"
10796,arding history. Finally he was forced to accept that his father had
10797,never set foot in Hogwarts. I believe that it was then that he
10798,"dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Volde-"
10799,"mort, and began his investigations into his previously despised"
10800, 362   
10801,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10802,"mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had"
10803,thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shame-
10804,ful human weakness of death.
10805,"“All he had to go upon was the single name ‘Marvolo,’ which he"
10806,knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother’s fa-
10807,"ther’s name. Finally, after painstaking research through old books"
10808,"of Wizarding families, he discovered the existence of Slytherin’s"
10809,"surviving line. In the summer of his sixteenth year, he left the or-"
10810,phanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his
10811,"Gaunt relatives. And now, Harry, if you will stand . . .”"
10812,"Dumbledore rose, and Harry saw that he was again holding a"
10813,"small crystal bottle filled with swirling, pearly memory."
10814,"“I was very lucky to collect this,” he said, as he poured the"
10815,gleaming mass into the Pensieve. “As you will understand when we
10816,have experienced it. Shall we?”
10817,Harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until
10818,his face sank through the surface of the memory; he felt the famil-
10819,iar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon
10820,a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness.
10821,"It took him several seconds to recognize the place, by which time"
10822,Dumbledore had landed beside him. The Gaunts’ house was now
10823,more indescribably filthy than anywhere Harry had ever seen. The
10824,"ceiling was thick with cobwebs, the floor coated in grime; moldy"
10825,and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pots.
10826,The only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the
10827,feet of a man with hair and beard so overgrown Harry could see
10828,neither eyes nor mouth. He was slumped in an armchair by the
10829,"fire, and Harry wondered for a moment whether he was dead. But"
10830, 363   
10831,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10832,then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked
10833,"awake, raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his"
10834,left.
10835,"The door creaked open. There on the threshold, holding an old-"
10836,"fashioned lamp, stood a boy Harry recognized at once: tall, pale,"
10837,"dark-haired, and handsome — the teenage Voldemort."
10838,Voldemort’s eyes moved slowly around the hovel and then found
10839,the man in the armchair. For a few seconds they looked at each
10840,"other, then the man staggered upright, the many empty bottles at"
10841,his feet clattering and tinkling across the floor.
10842,“YOU!” he bellowed. “YOU!”
10843,"And he hurtled drunkenly at Riddle, wand and knife held aloft."
10844,“Stop.”
10845,"Riddle spoke in Parseltongue. The man skidded into the table,"
10846,sending moldy pots crashing to the floor. He stared at Riddle.
10847,There was a long silence while they contemplated each other. The
10848,man broke it.
10849,“You speak it?”
10850,"“Yes, I speak it,” said Riddle. He moved forward into the room,"
10851,allowing the door to swing shut behind him. Harry could not help
10852,but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of
10853,"fear. His face merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappoint-"
10854,ment.
10855,“Where is Marvolo?” he asked.
10856,"“Dead,” said the other. “Died years ago, didn’t he?”"
10857,Riddle frowned.
10858,"“Who are you, then?”"
10859,"“I’m Morfin, ain’t I ?”"
10860,  364  
10861,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10862,“Marvolo’s son?”
10863,"“ ’Course I am, then . . .”"
10864,"Morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face, the better to see"
10865,"Riddle, and Harry saw that he wore Marvolo’s black-stoned ring on"
10866,his right hand.
10867,"“I thought you was that Muggle,” whispered Morfin. “You look"
10868,mighty like that Muggle.”
10869,“What Muggle?” said Riddle sharply.
10870,"“That Muggle what my sister took a fancy to, that Muggle what lives"
10871,"in the big house over the way,” said Morfin, and he spat unexpectedly"
10872,upon the floor between them. “You look right like him. Riddle. But
10873,"he’s older now, in ’e? He’s older’n you, now I think on it. . . .”"
10874,"Morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little, still clutching"
10875,"the edge of the table for support. “He come back, see,” he added"
10876,stupidly.
10877,Voldemort was gazing at Morfin as though appraising his possi-
10878,"bilities. Now he moved a little closer and said, “Riddle came back?”"
10879,"“Ar, he left her, and serve her right, marrying filth!” said Morfin,"
10880,"spitting on the floor again. “Robbed us, mind, before she ran off !"
10881,"Where’s the locket, eh, where’s Slytherin’s locket?”"
10882,Voldemort did not answer. Morfin was working himself into a
10883,"rage again; he brandished his knife and shouted, “Dishonored us,"
10884,"she did, that little slut! And who’re you, coming here and asking ques-"
10885,"tions about all that? It’s over, innit. . . . It’s over. . . .”"
10886,"He looked away, staggering slightly, and Voldemort moved for-"
10887,"ward. As he did so, an unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing Volde-"
10888,"mort’s lamp and Morfin’s candle, extinguishing everything. . . ."
10889,Dumbledore’s fingers closed tightly around Harry’s arm and
10890, 365    
10891,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10892,they were soaring back into the present again. The soft golden light
10893,in Dumbledore’s office seemed to dazzle Harry’s eyes after that im-
10894,penetrable darkness.
10895,"“Is that all?” said Harry at once. “Why did it go dark, what hap-"
10896,pened?”
10897,“Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point
10898,"onward,” said Dumbledore, gesturing Harry back into his seat."
10899,"“When he awoke next morning, he was lying on the floor, quite"
10900,alone. Marvolo’s ring had gone.
10901,"“Meanwhile, in the village of Little Hangleton, a maid was run-"
10902,"ning along the High Street, screaming that there were three bodies"
10903,lying in the drawing room of the big house: Tom Riddle Senior and
10904,his mother and father.
10905,"“The Muggle authorities were perplexed. As far as I am aware,"
10906,"they do not know to this day how the Riddles died, for the Avada"
10907,Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage. . . . The
10908,"exception sits before me,” Dumbledore added, with a nod to"
10909,"Harry’s scar. “The Ministry, on the other hand, knew at once that"
10910,this was a wizard’s murder. They also knew that a convicted Muggle-
10911,"hater lived across the valley from the Riddle house, a Muggle-hater"
10912,who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the
10913,murdered people.
10914,“So the Ministry called upon Morfin. They did not need to
10915,"question him, to use Veritaserum or Legilimency. He admitted to"
10916,"the murder on the spot, giving details only the murderer could"
10917,"know. He was proud, he said, to have killed the Muggles, had been"
10918,"awaiting his chance all these years. He handed over his wand,"
10919,which was proved at once to have been used to kill the Riddles.
10920,And he permitted himself to be led off to Azkaban without a fight.
10921, 366  
10922,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10923,All that disturbed him was the fact that his father’s ring had disap-
10924,"peared. ‘He’ll kill me for losing it,’ he told his captors over and over"
10925,"again. ‘He’ll kill me for losing his ring.’ And that, apparently, was"
10926,all he ever said again. He lived out the remainder of his life in Azka-
10927,"ban, lamenting the loss of Marvolo’s last heirloom, and is buried"
10928,"beside the prison, alongside the other poor souls who have expired"
10929,within its walls.”
10930,"“So Voldemort stole Morfin’s wand and used it?” said Harry, sit-"
10931,ting up straight.
10932,"“That’s right,” said Dumbledore. “We have no memories to"
10933,"show us this, but I think we can be fairly sure what happened."
10934,"Voldemort Stupefied his uncle, took his wand, and proceeded"
10935,across the valley to ‘the big house over the way’ There he murdered
10936,"the Muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother, and, for"
10937,"good measure, his Muggle grandparents, thus obliterating the last"
10938,of the unworthy Riddle line and revenging himself upon the father
10939,"who never wanted him. Then he returned to the Gaunt hovel, per-"
10940,formed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false mem-
10941,"ory in his uncle’s mind, laid Morfin’s wand beside its unconscious"
10942,"owner, pocketed the ancient ring he wore, and departed.”"
10943,“And Morfin never realized he hadn’t done it?”
10944,"“Never,” said Dumbledore. “He gave, as I say, a full and boastful"
10945,confession.”
10946,“But he had this real memory in him all the time!”
10947,"“Yes, but it took a great deal of skilled Legilimency to coax it out"
10948,"of him,” said Dumbledore, “and why should anybody delve further"
10949,into Morfin’s mind when he had already confessed to the crime?
10950,"However, I was able to secure a visit to Morfin in the last weeks of"
10951,"his life, by which time I was attempting to discover as much as I"
10952, 367   

10954,could about Voldemort’s past. I extracted this memory with diffi-
10955,"culty. When I saw what it contained, I attempted to use it to secure"
10956,Morfin’s release from Azkaban. Before the Ministry reached their
10957,"decision, however, Morfin had died.”"
10958,“But how come the Ministry didn’t realize that Voldemort had
10959,done all that to Morfin?” Harry asked angrily. “He was underage at
10960,"the time, wasn’t he? I thought they could detect underage magic!”"
10961,"“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the per-"
10962,petrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry
10963,"for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —”"
10964,"“Dobby,” growled Harry; this injustice still rankled. “So if you’re"
10965,"underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard’s house,"
10966,the Ministry won’t know?”
10967,"“They will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic,”"
10968,"said Dumbledore, smiling slightly at the look of great indignation"
10969,on Harry’s face. “They rely on witch and wizard parents to enforce
10970,their offspring’s obedience while within their walls.”
10971,"“Well, that’s rubbish,” snapped Harry. “Look what happened"
10972,"here, look what happened to Morfin!”"
10973,"“I agree,” said Dumbledore. “Whatever Morfin was, he did not"
10974,"deserve to die as he did, blamed for murders he had not commit-"
10975,"ted. But it is getting late, and I want you to see this other memory"
10976,before we part. . . .”
10977,Dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial
10978,"and Harry fell silent at once, remembering that Dumbledore had"
10979,said it was the most important one he had collected. Harry noticed
10980,"that the contents proved difficult to empty into the Pensieve, as"
10981,though they had congealed slightly; did memories go bad?
10982,"“This will not take long,” said Dumbledore, when he had finally"
10983, 368 
10984,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
10985,emptied the phial. “We shall be back before you know it. Once
10986,"more into the Pensieve, then . . .”"
10987,"And Harry fell again through the silver surface, landing this time"
10988,right in front of a man he recognized at once.
10989,It was a much younger Horace Slughorn. Harry was so used to
10990,"him bald that he found the sight of Slughorn with thick, shiny,"
10991,straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; it looked as though he had
10992,"had his head thatched, though there was already a shiny Galleon-"
10993,"sized bald patch on his crown. His mustache, less massive than it"
10994,"was these days, was gingery-blond. He was not quite as rotund as"
10995,"the Slughorn Harry knew, though the golden buttons on his richly"
10996,embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain. His lit-
10997,"tle feet resting upon a velvet pouffe, he was sitting well back in a"
10998,"comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping a small glass of"
10999,"wine, the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple."
11000,Harry looked around as Dumbledore appeared beside him and
11001,saw that they were standing in Slughorn’s office. Half a dozen boys
11002,"were sitting around Slughorn, all on harder or lower seats than his,"
11003,and all in their mid-teens. Harry recognized Voldemort at once.
11004,His was the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of
11005,all the boys. His right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his
11006,"chair; with a jolt, Harry saw that he was wearing Marvolo’s gold-"
11007,and-black ring; he had already killed his father.
11008,"“Sir, is it true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?” he asked."
11009,"“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wag-"
11010,"ging a reproving, sugar-covered finger at Riddle, though ruining"
11011,"the effect slightly by winking. “I must say, I’d like to know where"
11012,"you get your information, boy, more knowledgeable than half the"
11013,"staff, you are.”"
11014, 369  
11015,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
11016,Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring
11017,looks.
11018,"“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t,"
11019,and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for
11020,"the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —”"
11021,"As several of the boys tittered, something very odd happened."
11022,"The whole room was suddenly filled with a thick white fog, so that"
11023,"Harry could see nothing but the face of Dumbledore, who was"
11024,standing beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice rang out through the
11025,"mist, unnaturally loudly, “You’ll go wrong, boy, mark my words.”"
11026,The fog cleared as suddenly as it had appeared and yet nobody
11027,"made any allusion to it, nor did anybody look as though anything"
11028,"unusual had just happened. Bewildered, Harry looked around as a"
11029,small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed eleven
11030,o’clock.
11031,"“Good gracious, is it that time already?” said Slughorn. “You’d"
11032,"better get going, boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want"
11033,"your essay by tomorrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”"
11034,Slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his
11035,"empty glass over to his desk as the boys filed out. Voldemort, how-"
11036,"ever, stayed behind. Harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately,"
11037,wanting to be last in the room with Slughorn.
11038,"“Look sharp, Tom,” said Slughorn, turning around and finding"
11039,him still present. “You don’t want to be caught out of bed out of
11040,"hours, and you a prefect . . .”"
11041,"“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”"
11042,"“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”"
11043,"“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”"
11044,And it happened all over again: The dense fog filled the room
11045, 370  
11046,A SLUGGISH MEMORY
11047,so that Harry could not see Slughorn or Voldemort at all; only
11048,"Dumbledore, smiling serenely beside him. Then Slughorn’s voice"
11049,"boomed out again, just as it had done before."
11050,“I don’t know anything about Horcruxes and I wouldn’t tell you if I
11051,did! Now get out of here at once and don’t let me catch you mentioning
11052,them again!”
11053,"“Well, that’s that,” said Dumbledore placidly beside Harry."
11054,“Time to go.”
11055,"And Harry’s feet left the floor to fall, seconds later, back onto the"
11056,rug in front of Dumbledore’s desk.
11057,“That’s all there is?” said Harry blankly.
11058,Dumbledore had said that this was the most important memory
11059,"of all, but he could not see what was so significant about it. Ad-"
11060,"mittedly the fog, and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed"
11061,"it, was odd, but other than that nothing seemed to have happened"
11062,except that Voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an
11063,answer.
11064,"“As you might have noticed,” said Dumbledore, reseating him-"
11065,"self behind his desk, “that memory has been tampered with.”"
11066,"“Tampered with?” repeated Harry, sitting back down too."
11067,"“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. “Professor Slughorn has meddled"
11068,with his own recollections.”
11069,“But why would he do that?”
11070,"“Because, I think, he is ashamed of what he remembers,” said"
11071,Dumbledore. “He has tried to rework the memory to show himself
11072,"in a better light, obliterating those parts which he does not wish me"
11073,"to see. It is, as you will have noticed, very crudely done, and that is"
11074,"all to the good, for it shows that the true memory is still there be-"
11075,neath the alterations.
11076, 371   
11077,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
11078,"“And so, for the first time, I am giving you homework, Harry. It"
11079,will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real
11080,"memory, which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of in-"
11081,formation of all.”
11082,Harry stared at him.
11083,"“But surely, sir,” he said, keeping his voice as respectful as pos-"
11084,"sible, “you don’t need me — you could use Legilimency . . . or"
11085,Veritaserum. . . .”
11086,“Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be ex-
11087,"pecting both,” said Dumbledore. “He is much more accomplished"
11088,"at Occlumency than poor Morfin Gaunt, and I would be aston-"
11089,ished if he has not carried an antidote to Veritaserum with him ever
11090,since I coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection.
11091,"“No, I think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth"
11092,"from Professor Slughorn by force, and might do much more harm"
11093,"than good; I do not wish him to leave Hogwarts. However, he has"
11094,"his weaknesses like the rest of us, and I believe that you are the one"
11095,person who might be able to penetrate his defenses. It is most im-
11096,"portant that we secure the true memory, Harry. . . . How impor-"
11097,"tant, we will only know when we have seen the real thing. So, good"
11098,luck . . . and good night.”
11099,"A little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal, Harry got to his feet"
11100,"quickly. “Good night, sir.”"
11101,"As he closed the study door behind him, he distinctly heard"
11102,"Phineas Nigellus say, “I can’t see why the boy should be able to do"
11103,"it better than you, Dumbledore.”"
11104,"“I wouldn’t expect you to, Phineas,” replied Dumbledore, and"
11105,"Fawkes gave another low, musical cry."

11107,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11108,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11109,T      he next day Harry confided in both Ron and Hermione
11110,"the task that Dumbledore had set him, though separately,"
11111,for Hermione still refused to remain in Ron’s presence longer than
11112,it took to give him a contemptuous look.
11113,Ron thought that Harry was unlikely to have any trouble with
11114,Slughorn at all.
11115,"“He loves you,” he said over breakfast, waving an airy forkful of"
11116,"fried egg. “Won’t refuse you anything, will he? Not his little Potions"
11117,Prince. Just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him.”
11118,"Hermione, however, took a gloomier view. “He must be deter-"
11119,mined to hide what really happened if Dumbledore couldn’t get it
11120,"out of him,” she said in a low voice, as they stood in the deserted,"
11121,snowy courtyard at break. “Horcruxes . . . Horcruxes . . . I’ve never
11122,even heard of them. . . .”
11123,“You haven’t?” Harry was disappointed; he had hoped that
11124, 373    
11125,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11126,Hermione might have been able to give him a clue as to what Hor-
11127,cruxes were.
11128,"“They must be really advanced Dark Magic, or why would"
11129,Voldemort have wanted to know about them? I think it’s going
11130,"to be difficult to get the information, Harry, you’ll have to be very"
11131,"careful about how you approach Slughorn, think out a strat-"
11132,egy. . . .”
11133,“Ron reckons I should just hang back after Potions this after-
11134,noon. . . .”
11135,"“Oh, well, if Won-Won thinks that, you’d better do it,” she said,"
11136,"flaring up at once. “After all, when has Won-Won’s judgment ever"
11137,been faulty?”
11138,"“Hermione, can’t you — ?”"
11139,"“No!” she said angrily, and stormed away, leaving Harry alone"
11140,and ankle-deep in snow.
11141,"Potions lessons were uncomfortable enough these days, seeing as"
11142,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to share a desk. Today, Hermione"
11143,"moved her cauldron around the table so that she was close to Ernie,"
11144,and ignored both Harry and Ron.
11145,"“What’ve you done?” Ron muttered to Harry, looking at Hermi-"
11146,one’s haughty profile.
11147,"But before Harry could answer, Slughorn was calling for silence"
11148,from the front of the room.
11149,"“Settle down, settle down, please! Quickly, now, lots of work to"
11150,get through this afternoon! Golpalott’s Third Law . . . who can tell
11151,"me — ? But Miss Granger can, of course!”"
11152,Hermione recited at top speed: “Golpalott’s-Third-Law-states-
11153,that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to-more-than-
11154,the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separate-components.”
11155, 374  
11156,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11157,"“Precisely!” beamed Slughorn. “Ten points for Gryffindor! Now,"
11158,if we accept Golpalott’s Third Law as true . . .”
11159,Harry was going to have to take Slughorn’s word for it that Gol-
11160,"palott’s Third Law was true, because he had not understood any of"
11161,it. Nobody apart from Hermione seemed to be following what
11162,Slughorn said next either.
11163,"“. . . which means, of course, that assuming we have achieved"
11164,correct identification of the potion’s ingredients by Scarpin’s Revel-
11165,"aspell, our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting"
11166,"antidotes to those ingredients in and of themselves, but to find that"
11167,"added component that will, by an almost alchemical process, trans-"
11168,form these disparate elements —”
11169,"Ron was sitting beside Harry with his mouth half open, doo-"
11170,dling absently on his new copy of Advanced Potion-Making. Ron
11171,kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on Hermione to help
11172,him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what was going on.
11173,"“. . . and so,” finished Slughorn, “I want each of you to come"
11174,and take one of these phials from my desk. You are to create an an-
11175,tidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson. Good
11176,"luck, and don’t forget your protective gloves!”"
11177,Hermione had left her stool and was halfway toward Slughorn’s
11178,"desk before the rest of the class had realized it was time to move,"
11179,"and by the time Harry, Ron, and Ernie returned to the table, she"
11180,had already tipped the contents of her phial into her cauldron and
11181,was kindling a fire underneath it.
11182,“It’s a shame that the Prince won’t be able to help you much
11183,"with this, Harry,” she said brightly as she straightened up. “You"
11184,have to understand the principles involved this time. No shortcuts
11185,or cheats!”
11186, 375   
11187,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11188,"Annoyed, Harry uncorked the poison he had taken from Slug-"
11189,"horn’s desk, which was a garish shade of pink, tipped it into his"
11190,"cauldron, and lit a fire underneath it. He did not have the faintest"
11191,"idea what he was supposed to do next. He glanced around at Ron,"
11192,"who was now standing there looking rather gormless, having"
11193,copied everything Harry had done.
11194,“You sure the Prince hasn’t got any tips?” Ron muttered to
11195,Harry.
11196,Harry pulled out his trusty copy of Advanced Potion-Making and
11197,turned to the chapter on antidotes. There was Golpalott’s Third
11198,"Law, stated word for word as Hermione had recited it, but not a"
11199,single illuminating note in the Prince’s hand to explain what it
11200,"meant. Apparently the Prince, like Hermione, had had no diffi-"
11201,culty understanding it.
11202,"“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily."
11203,Hermione was now waving her wand enthusiastically over her
11204,"cauldron. Unfortunately, they could not copy the spell she was do-"
11205,ing because she was now so good at nonverbal incantations that she
11206,"did not need to say the words aloud. Ernie Macmillan, however,"
11207,"was muttering, “Specialis Revelio!” over his cauldron, which sounded"
11208,"impressive, so Harry and Ron hastened to imitate him."
11209,It took Harry only five minutes to realize that his reputation as
11210,the best potion-maker in the class was crashing around his ears.
11211,Slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit
11212,"of the dungeon, preparing to exclaim in delight as he usually did,"
11213,"and instead had withdrawn his head hastily, coughing, as the smell"
11214,of bad eggs overwhelmed him. Hermione’s expression could not
11215,have been any smugger; she had loathed being outperformed in
11216,every Potions class. She was now decanting the mysteriously sepa-
11217,  376  
11218,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11219,rated ingredients of her poison into ten different crystal phials.
11220,"More to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else,"
11221,Harry bent over the Half-Blood Prince’s book and turned a few
11222,pages with unnecessary force.
11223,"And there it was, scrawled right across a long list of antidotes:"
11224,Just shove a bezoar down their throats.
11225,"Harry stared at these words for a moment. Hadn’t he once, long"
11226,"ago, heard of bezoars? Hadn’t Snape mentioned them in their first-"
11227,"ever Potions lesson? “A stone taken from the stomach of a goat, which"
11228,will protect from most poisons.”
11229,"It was not an answer to the Golpalott problem, and had Snape"
11230,"still been their teacher, Harry would not have dared do it, but this"
11231,was a moment for desperate measures. He hastened toward the
11232,"store cupboard and rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn"
11233,"horns and tangles of dried herbs until he found, at the very back, a"
11234,small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word
11235,bezoars.
11236,"He opened the box just as Slughorn called, “Two minutes left,"
11237,"everyone!” Inside were half a dozen shriveled brown objects, look-"
11238,"ing more like dried-up kidneys than real stones. Harry seized one,"
11239,"put the box back in the cupboard, and hurried back to his"
11240,cauldron.
11241,"“Time’s . . . UP!” called Slughorn genially. “Well, let’s see how"
11242,you’ve done! Blaise . . . what have you got for me?”
11243,"Slowly, Slughorn moved around the room, examining the vari-"
11244,"ous antidotes. Nobody had finished the task, although Hermione"
11245,was trying to cram a few more ingredients into her bottle before
11246, 377  
11247,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11248,"Slughorn reached her. Ron had given up completely, and was"
11249,merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fumes issuing from
11250,"his cauldron. Harry stood there waiting, the bezoar clutched in a"
11251,slightly sweaty hand.
11252,Slughorn reached their table last. He sniffed Ernie’s potion and
11253,passed on to Ron’s with a grimace. He did not linger over Ron’s
11254,"cauldron, but backed away swiftly, retching slightly."
11255,"“And you, Harry,” he said. “What have you got to show me?”"
11256,"Harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm."
11257,Slughorn looked down at it for a full ten seconds. Harry won-
11258,"dered, for a moment, whether he was going to shout at him. Then"
11259,he threw back his head and roared with laughter.
11260,"“You’ve got nerve, boy!” he boomed, taking the bezoar and hold-"
11261,"ing it up so that the class could see it. “Oh, you’re like your mother."
11262,". . . Well, I can’t fault you. . . . A bezoar would certainly act as an"
11263,antidote to all these potions!”
11264,"Hermione, who was sweaty-faced and had soot on her nose,"
11265,"looked livid. Her half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two in-"
11266,"gredients, including a chunk of her own hair, bubbled sluggishly"
11267,"behind Slughorn, who had eyes for nobody but Harry."
11268,"“And you thought of a bezoar all by yourself, did you, Harry?”"
11269,she asked through gritted teeth.
11270,“That’s the individual spirit a real potion-maker needs!” said
11271,"Slughorn happily, before Harry could reply. “Just like his mother,"
11272,"she had the same intuitive grasp of potion-making, it’s undoubt-"
11273,"edly from Lily he gets it. . . . Yes, Harry, yes, if you’ve got a bezoar"
11274,"to hand, of course that would do the trick . . . although as they"
11275,"don’t work on everything, and are pretty rare, it’s still worth know-"
11276,ing how to mix antidotes. . . .”
11277, 378  
11278,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11279,The only person in the room looking angrier than Hermione
11280,"was Malfoy, who, Harry was pleased to see, had spilled something"
11281,that looked like cat-sick over himself. Before either of them could
11282,express their fury that Harry had come top of the class by not do-
11283,"ing any work, however, the bell rang."
11284,“Time to pack up!” said Slughorn. “And an extra ten points to
11285,Gryffindor for sheer cheek!”
11286,"Still chuckling, he waddled back to his desk at the front of the"
11287,dungeon.
11288,"Harry dawdled behind, taking an inordinate amount of time to"
11289,do up his bag. Neither Ron nor Hermione wished him luck as they
11290,left; both looked rather annoyed. At last Harry and Slughorn were
11291,the only two left in the room.
11292,"“Come on, now, Harry, you’ll be late for your next lesson,” said"
11293,"Slughorn affably, snapping the gold clasps shut on his dragon-skin"
11294,briefcase.
11295,"“Sir,” said Harry, reminding himself irresistibly of Voldemort, “I"
11296,wanted to ask you something.”
11297,"“Ask away, then, my dear boy, ask away. . . .”"
11298,"“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”"
11299,Slughorn froze. His round face seemed to sink in upon itself. He
11300,"licked his lips and said hoarsely, “What did you say?”"
11301,"“I asked whether you know anything about Horcruxes, sir. You"
11302,see —”
11303,"“Dumbledore put you up to this,” whispered Slughorn. His"
11304,"voice had changed completely. It was not genial anymore, but"
11305,"shocked, terrified. He fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out"
11306,"a handkerchief, mopping his sweating brow. “Dumbledore’s shown"
11307,you that — that memory. Well? Hasn’t he?”
11308, 379  
11309,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11310,"“Yes,” said Harry, deciding on the spot that it was best not to lie."
11311,"“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn quietly, still dabbing at his white"
11312,"face. “Of course . . . well, if you’ve seen that memory, Harry, you’ll"
11313,know that I don’t know anything — anything” — he repeated the
11314,word forcefully — “about Horcruxes.”
11315,"He seized his dragon-skin briefcase, stuffed his handkerchief"
11316,"back into his pocket, and marched to the dungeon door."
11317,"“Sir,” said Harry desperately, “I just thought there might be a bit"
11318,more to the memory —”
11319,"“Did you?” said Slughorn. “Then you were wrong, weren’t you?"
11320,WRONG!”
11321,"He bellowed the last word and, before Harry could say another"
11322,"word, slammed the dungeon door behind him."
11323,Neither Ron nor Hermione was at all sympathetic when Harry
11324,told them of this disastrous interview. Hermione was still seething
11325,at the way Harry had triumphed without doing the work properly.
11326,Ron was resentful that Harry hadn’t slipped him a bezoar too.
11327,“It would’ve just looked stupid if we’d both done it!” said Harry
11328,"irritably. “Look, I had to try and soften him up so I could ask him"
11329,"about Voldemort, didn’t I? Oh, will you get a grip!” he added in ex-"
11330,"asperation, as Ron winced at the sound of the name."
11331,"Infuriated by his failure and by Ron’s and Hermione’s attitudes,"
11332,Harry brooded for the next few days over what to do next about
11333,"Slughorn. He decided that, for the time being, he would let Slug-"
11334,horn think that he had forgotten all about Horcruxes; it was surely
11335,best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the
11336,attack.
11337,"When Harry did not question Slughorn again, the Potions"
11338,"master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him, and"
11339, 380  
11340,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11341,appeared to have put the matter from his mind. Harry awaited an
11342,"invitation to one of his little evening parties, determined to accept"
11343,"this time, even if he had to reschedule Quidditch practice. Unfor-"
11344,"tunately, however, no such invitation arrived. Harry checked with"
11345,Hermione and Ginny: Neither of them had received an invitation
11346,"and nor, as far as they knew, had anybody else. Harry could not"
11347,help wondering whether this meant that Slughorn was not quite as
11348,"forgetful as he appeared, simply determined to give Harry no addi-"
11349,tional opportunities to question him.
11350,"Meanwhile, the Hogwarts library had failed Hermione for the"
11351,"first time in living memory. She was so shocked, she even forgot"
11352,that she was annoyed at Harry for his trick with the bezoar.
11353,“I haven’t found one single explanation of what Horcruxes do!”
11354,she told him. “Not a single one! I’ve been right through the re-
11355,"stricted section and even in the most horrible books, where they tell"
11356,you how to brew the most gruesome potions — nothing! All I could
11357,"find was this, in the introduction to Magick Moste Evile — listen —"
11358,"‘Of the Horcrux, wickedest of magical inventions, we shall not"
11359,"speak nor give direction. . . .’ I mean, why mention it then?” she"
11360,"said impatiently, slamming the old book shut; it let out a ghostly"
11361,"wail. “Oh, shut up,” she snapped, stuffing it back into her bag."
11362,"The snow melted around the school as February arrived, to be"
11363,"replaced by cold, dreary wetness. Purplish-gray clouds hung low"
11364,over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawns slip-
11365,pery and muddy. The upshot of this was that the sixth years’ first
11366,"Apparition lesson, which was scheduled for a Saturday morning so"
11367,"that no normal lessons would be missed, took place in the Great"
11368,Hall instead of in the grounds.
11369,When Harry and Hermione arrived in the Hall (Ron had come
11370, 381  
11371,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11372,"down with Lavender), they found that the tables had disappeared."
11373,Rain lashed against the high windows and the enchanted ceiling
11374,swirled darkly above them as they assembled in front of Professors
11375,"McGonagall, Snape, Flitwick, and Sprout — the Heads of Houses"
11376,— and a small wizard whom Harry took to be the Apparition in-
11377,"structor from the Ministry. He was oddly colorless, with transpar-"
11378,"ent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single"
11379,gust of wind might blow him away. Harry wondered whether con-
11380,stant disappearances and reappearances had somehow diminished
11381,"his substance, or whether this frail build was ideal for anyone wish-"
11382,ing to vanish.
11383,"“Good morning,” said the Ministry wizard, when all the stu-"
11384,dents had arrived and the Heads of Houses had called for quiet.
11385,“My name is Wilkie Twycross and I shall be your Ministry Appari-
11386,tion instructor for the next twelve weeks. I hope to be able to
11387,prepare you for your Apparition Tests in this time —”
11388,"“Malfoy, be quiet and pay attention!” barked Professor McGon-"
11389,agall.
11390,Everybody looked around. Malfoy had flushed a dull pink; he
11391,"looked furious as he stepped away from Crabbe, with whom he ap-"
11392,peared to have been having a whispered argument. Harry glanced
11393,"quickly at Snape, who also looked annoyed, though Harry strongly"
11394,suspected that this was less because of Malfoy’s rudeness than the
11395,fact that McGonagall had reprimanded one of his House.
11396,"“— by which time, many of you may be ready to take your"
11397,"tests,” Twycross continued, as though there had been no inter-"
11398,ruption.
11399,"“As you may know, it is usually impossible to Apparate or"
11400,Disapparate within Hogwarts. The headmaster has lifted this en-
11401, 382  
11402,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11403,"chantment, purely within the Great Hall, for one hour, so as to en-"
11404,able you to practice. May I emphasize that you will not be able to
11405,"Apparate outside the walls of this Hall, and that you would be un-"
11406,wise to try.
11407,“I would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you
11408,have a clear five feet of space in front of you.”
11409,"There was a great scrambling and jostling as people separated,"
11410,"banged into each other, and ordered others out of their space. The"
11411,"Heads of Houses moved among the students, marshaling them"
11412,into position and breaking up arguments.
11413,"“Harry, where are you going?” demanded Hermione."
11414,But Harry did not answer; he was moving quickly through the
11415,"crowd, past the place where Professor Flitwick was making squeaky"
11416,"attempts to position a few Ravenclaws, all of whom wanted to be"
11417,"near the front, past Professor Sprout, who was chivying the Huf-"
11418,"flepuffs into line, until, by dodging around Ernie Macmillan, he"
11419,"managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd, directly"
11420,"behind Malfoy, who was taking advantage of the general upheaval"
11421,"to continue his argument with Crabbe, standing five feet away and"
11422,looking mutinous.
11423,"“I don’t know how much longer, all right?” Malfoy shot at him,"
11424,oblivious to Harry standing right behind him. “It’s taking longer
11425,than I thought it would.”
11426,"Crabbe opened his mouth, but Malfoy appeared to second-guess"
11427,"what he was going to say. “Look, it’s none of your business what"
11428,"I’m doing, Crabbe, you and Goyle just do as you’re told and keep a"
11429,lookout!”
11430,"“I tell my friends what I’m up to, if I want them to keep a look-"
11431,"out for me,” Harry said, just loud enough for Malfoy to hear him."
11432, 383  
11433,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11434,"Malfoy spun around on the spot, his hand flying to his wand,"
11435,"but at that precise moment the four Heads of House shouted,"
11436,“Quiet!” and silence fell again. Malfoy turned slowly to face the
11437,front again.
11438,"“Thank you,” said Twycross. “Now then . . .”"
11439,He waved his wand. Old-fashioned wooden hoops instantly ap-
11440,peared on the floor in front of every student.
11441,“The important things to remember when Apparating are the
11442,"three D’s!” said Twycross. “Destination, Determination, Delibera-"
11443,tion!
11444,"“Step one: Fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination,”"
11445,"said Twycross. “In this case, the interior of your hoop. Kindly con-"
11446,centrate upon that destination now.”
11447,Everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else
11448,"was staring into their hoop, then hastily did as they were told."
11449,Harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his
11450,hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else. This proved impossi-
11451,"ble, as he couldn’t stop puzzling over what Malfoy was doing that"
11452,needed lookouts.
11453,"“Step two,” said Twycross, “focus your determination to occupy"
11454,the visualized space! Let your yearning to enter it flood from your
11455,mind to every particle of your body!”
11456,"Harry glanced around surreptitiously. A little way to his left,"
11457,Ernie Macmillan was contemplating his hoop so hard that his face
11458,had turned pink; it looked as though he was straining to lay a
11459,Quaffle-sized egg. Harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his
11460,gaze to his own hoop.
11461,"“Step three,” called Twycross, “and only when I give the com-"
11462, 384   
11463,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11464,"mand . . . Turn on the spot, feeling your way into nothingness,"
11465,"moving with deliberation! On my command, now . . . one —”"
11466,Harry glanced around again; lots of people were looking posi-
11467,tively alarmed at being asked to Apparate so quickly.
11468,“— two —”
11469,Harry tried to fix his thoughts on his hoop again; he had already
11470,forgotten what the three D’s stood for.
11471,“— THREE!”
11472,"Harry spun on the spot, lost balance, and nearly fell over. He"
11473,was not the only one. The whole Hall was suddenly full of stagger-
11474,"ing people; Neville was flat on his back; Ernie Macmillan, on the"
11475,"other hand, had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and"
11476,"looked momentarily thrilled, until he caught sight of Dean"
11477,Thomas roaring with laughter at him.
11478,"“Never mind, never mind,” said Twycross dryly, who did not"
11479,"seem to have expected anything better. “Adjust your hoops, please,"
11480,and back to your original positions. . . .”
11481,The second attempt was no better than the first. The third was
11482,just as bad. Not until the fourth did anything exciting happen.
11483,"There was a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around,"
11484,"terrified, to see Susan Bones of Hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop"
11485,with her left leg still standing five feet away where she had started.
11486,The Heads of House converged on her; there was a great bang
11487,"and a puff of purple smoke, which cleared to reveal Susan sobbing,"
11488,reunited with her leg but looking horrified.
11489,"“Splinching, or the separation of random body parts,” said"
11490,"Wilkie Twycross dispassionately, “occurs when the mind is insuffi-"
11491,ciently determined. You must concentrate continuously upon your
11492, 385   
11493,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11494,"destination, and move, without haste, but with deliberation . . ."
11495,thus.”
11496,"Twycross stepped forward, turned gracefully on the spot with his"
11497,"arms outstretched, and vanished in a swirl of robes, reappearing at"
11498,the back of the Hall.
11499,"“Remember the three D’s,” he said, “and try again . . . one —"
11500,two — three —”
11501,"But an hour later, Susan’s Splinching was still the most interest-"
11502,ing thing that had happened. Twycross did not seem discouraged.
11503,"Fastening his cloak at his neck, he merely said, “Until next Sat-"
11504,"urday, everybody, and do not forget: Destination. Determination."
11505,Deliberation.”
11506,"With that, he waved his wand, Vanishing the hoops, and walked"
11507,out of the Hall accompanied by Professor McGonagall. Talk broke
11508,out at once as people began moving toward the entrance hall.
11509,"“How did you do?” asked Ron, hurrying toward Harry. “I think"
11510,I felt something the last time I tried — a kind of tingling in my
11511,feet.”
11512,"“I expect your trainers are too small, Won-Won,” said a voice be-"
11513,"hind them, and Hermione stalked past, smirking."
11514,"“I didn’t feel anything,” said Harry, ignoring this interruption."
11515,“But I don’t care about that now —”
11516,"“What d’you mean, you don’t care? Don’t you want to learn to"
11517,Apparate?” said Ron incredulously.
11518,"“I’m not fussed, really, I prefer flying,” said Harry, glancing over"
11519,"his shoulder to see where Malfoy was, and speeding up as they"
11520,"came into the entrance hall. “Look, hurry up, will you, there’s"
11521,something I want to do. . . .”
11522,"Perplexed, Ron followed Harry back to the Gryffindor Tower at"
11523, 386   
11524,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11525,"a run. They were temporarily detained by Peeves, who had jammed"
11526,a door on the fourth floor shut and was refusing to let anyone pass
11527,"until they set fire to their own pants, but Harry and Ron simply"
11528,turned back and took one of their trusted shortcuts. Within five
11529,"minutes, they were climbing through the portrait hole."
11530,"“Are you going to tell me what we’re doing, then?” asked Ron,"
11531,panting slightly.
11532,"“Up here,” said Harry, and he crossed the common room and led"
11533,the way through the door to the boys’ staircase.
11534,"Their dormitory was, as Harry had hoped, empty. He flung open"
11535,"his trunk and began to rummage in it, while Ron watched"
11536,impatiently.
11537,“Harry . . .”
11538,“Malfoy’s using Crabbe and Goyle as lookouts. He was arguing
11539,with Crabbe just now. I want to know — aha.”
11540,"He had found it, a folded square of apparently blank parchment,"
11541,which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand.
11542,“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . . . or Malfoy is any-
11543,way.”
11544,"At once, the Marauder’s Map appeared on the parchment’s sur-"
11545,"face. Here was a detailed plan of every one of the castle’s floors and,"
11546,"moving around it, the tiny, labeled black dots that signified each of"
11547,the castle’s occupants.
11548,"“Help me find Malfoy,” said Harry urgently."
11549,"He laid the map upon his bed, and he and Ron leaned over it,"
11550,searching.
11551,"“There!” said Ron, after a minute or so. “He’s in the Slytherin"
11552,"common room, look . . . with Parkinson and Zabini and Crabbe"
11553,and Goyle . . .”
11554, 387   
11555,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11556,"Harry looked down at the map, disappointed, but rallied almost"
11557,at once.
11558,"“Well, I’m keeping an eye on him from now on,” he said firmly."
11559,“And the moment I see him lurking somewhere with Crabbe and
11560,"Goyle keeping watch outside, it’ll be on with the old Invisibility"
11561,Cloak and off to find out what he’s —”
11562,"He broke off as Neville entered the dormitory, bringing with"
11563,"him a strong smell of singed material, and began rummaging in his"
11564,trunk for a fresh pair of pants.
11565,"Despite his determination to catch Malfoy out, Harry had no"
11566,luck at all over the next couple of weeks. Although he consulted the
11567,"map as often as he could, sometimes making unnecessary visits to"
11568,"the bathroom between lessons to search it, he did not once see Mal-"
11569,"foy anywhere suspicious. Admittedly, he spotted Crabbe and Goyle"
11570,"moving around the castle on their own more often than usual,"
11571,"sometimes remaining stationary in deserted corridors, but at these"
11572,"times Malfoy was not only nowhere near them, but impossible to"
11573,locate on the map at all. This was most mysterious. Harry toyed
11574,with the possibility that Malfoy was actually leaving the school
11575,"grounds, but could not see how he could be doing it, given the very"
11576,high level of security now operating within the castle. He could
11577,only suppose that he was missing Malfoy amongst the hundreds of
11578,"tiny black dots upon the map. As for the fact that Malfoy, Crabbe,"
11579,and Goyle appeared to be going their different ways when they
11580,"were usually inseparable, these things happened as people got"
11581,"older — Ron and Hermione, Harry reflected sadly, were living"
11582,proof.
11583,February moved toward March with no change in the weather
11584,"except that it became windy as well as wet. To general indignation,"
11585, 388  
11586,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11587,a sign went up on all common room notice boards that the next
11588,trip into Hogsmeade had been canceled. Ron was furious.
11589,“It was on my birthday!” he said. “I was looking forward to
11590,that!”
11591,"“Not a big surprise, though, is it?” said Harry. “Not after what"
11592,happened to Katie.”
11593,"She had still not returned from St. Mungo’s. What was more,"
11594,"further disappearances had been reported in the Daily Prophet, in-"
11595,cluding several relatives of students at Hogwarts.
11596,“But now all I’ve got to look forward to is stupid Apparition!”
11597,said Ron grumpily. “Big birthday treat . . .”
11598,"Three lessons on, Apparition was proving as difficult as ever,"
11599,though a few more people had managed to Splinch themselves.
11600,Frustration was running high and there was a certain amount of ill-
11601,"feeling toward Wilkie Twycross and his three D’s, which had in-"
11602,"spired a number of nicknames for him, the politest of which were"
11603,Dogbreath and Dunghead.
11604,"“Happy birthday, Ron,” said Harry, when they were woken on"
11605,the first of March by Seamus and Dean leaving noisily for break-
11606,fast. “Have a present.”
11607,"He threw the package across onto Ron’s bed, where it joined a"
11608,"small pile of them that must, Harry assumed, have been delivered"
11609,by house-elves in the night.
11610,"“Cheers,” said Ron drowsily and, as he ripped off the paper,"
11611,"Harry got out of bed, opened his own trunk, and began rummag-"
11612,"ing in it for the Marauder’s Map, which he hid after every use. He"
11613,turfed out half the contents of his trunk before he found it hiding
11614,beneath the rolled-up socks in which he was still keeping his bottle
11615,"of lucky potion, Felix Felicis."
11616, 389  
11617,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11618,"“Right,” he murmured, taking it back to bed with him, tapping"
11619,"it quietly and murmuring, “I solemnly swear that I am up to no"
11620,"good,” so that Neville, who was passing the foot of his bed at the"
11621,"time, would not hear."
11622,"“Nice one, Harry!” said Ron enthusiastically, waving the new"
11623,pair of Quidditch Keeper’s gloves Harry had given him.
11624,"“No problem,” said Harry absentmindedly, as he searched the"
11625,Slytherin dormitory closely for Malfoy. “Hey . . . I don’t think he’s
11626,in his bed. . . .”
11627,"Ron did not answer; he was too busy unwrapping presents, every"
11628,now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure.
11629,"“Seriously good haul this year!” he announced, holding up a"
11630,heavy gold watch with odd symbols around the edge and tiny mov-
11631,ing stars instead of hands. “See what Mum and Dad got me?
11632,"Blimey, I think I’ll come of age next year too. . . .”"
11633,"“Cool,” muttered Harry, sparing the watch a glance before peer-"
11634,ing more closely at the map. Where was Malfoy? He did not seem
11635,"to be at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, eating breakfast. . . ."
11636,"He was nowhere near Snape, who was sitting in his study. . . . He"
11637,wasn’t in any of the bathrooms or in the hospital wing. . . .
11638,"“Want one?” said Ron thickly, holding out a box of Chocolate"
11639,Cauldrons.
11640,"“No thanks,” said Harry, looking up. “Malfoy’s gone again!”"
11641,"“Can’t have done,” said Ron, stuffing a second Cauldron into his"
11642,"mouth as he slid out of bed to get dressed. “Come on, if you don’t"
11643,"hurry up, you’ll have to Apparate on an empty stomach. . . . Might"
11644,"make it easier, I suppose . . .” Ron looked thoughtfully at the box"
11645,"of Chocolate Cauldrons, then shrugged and helped himself to a"
11646,third.
11647, 390  
11648,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11649,"Harry tapped the map with his wand, muttered, “Mischief man-"
11650,"aged,” though it hadn’t been, and got dressed, thinking hard. There"
11651,"had to be an explanation for Malfoy’s periodic disappearances, but"
11652,he simply could not think what it could be. The best way of find-
11653,"ing out would be to tail him, but even with the Invisibility Cloak"
11654,"this was an impractical idea: Harry had lessons, Quidditch prac-"
11655,"tice, homework, and Apparition; he could not follow Malfoy"
11656,around school all day without his absence being remarked upon.
11657,“Ready?” he said to Ron.
11658,He was halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that
11659,"Ron had not moved, but was leaning on his bedpost, staring out of"
11660,the rain-washed window with a strangely unfocused look on his
11661,face.
11662,“Ron? Breakfast.”
11663,“I’m not hungry.”
11664,Harry stared at him.
11665,“I thought you just said — ?”
11666,"“Well, all right, I’ll come down with you,” sighed Ron, “but I"
11667,don’t want to eat.”
11668,Harry scrutinized him suspiciously.
11669,"“You’ve just eaten half a box of Chocolate Cauldrons, haven’t"
11670,you?”
11671,"“It’s not that,” Ron sighed again. “You . . . you wouldn’t under-"
11672,stand.”
11673,"“Fair enough,” said Harry, albeit puzzled, as he turned to open"
11674,the door.
11675,“Harry!” said Ron suddenly.
11676,“What?”
11677,"“Harry, I can’t stand it!”"
11678, 391  
11679,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11680,"“You can’t stand what?” asked Harry, now starting to feel defi-"
11681,nitely alarmed. Ron was rather pale and looked as though he was
11682,about to be sick.
11683,“I can’t stop thinking about her!” said Ron hoarsely.
11684,Harry gaped at him. He had not expected this and was not sure
11685,"he wanted to hear it. Friends they might be, but if Ron started call-"
11686,"ing Lavender “Lav-Lav,” he would have to put his foot down."
11687,"“Why does that stop you having breakfast?” Harry asked, trying"
11688,to inject a note of common sense into the proceedings.
11689,"“I don’t think she knows I exist,” said Ron with a desperate"
11690,gesture.
11691,"“She definitely knows you exist,” said Harry, bewildered. “She"
11692,"keeps snogging you, doesn’t she?”"
11693,Ron blinked. “Who are you talking about?”
11694,"“Who are you talking about?” said Harry, with an increasing"
11695,sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation.
11696,"“Romilda Vane,” said Ron softly, and his whole face seemed to"
11697,"illuminate as he said it, as though hit by a ray of purest sunlight."
11698,"They stared at each other for almost a whole minute, before"
11699,"Harry said, “This is a joke, right? You’re joking.”"
11700,"“I think . . . Harry, I think I love her,” said Ron in a strangled"
11701,voice.
11702,"“Okay,” said Harry, walking up to Ron to get a better look at the"
11703,"glazed eyes and the pallid complexion, “okay. . . Say that again"
11704,with a straight face.”
11705,"“I love her,” repeated Ron breathlessly. “Have you seen her hair,"
11706,it’s all black and shiny and silky . . . and her eyes? Her big dark
11707,eyes? And her —”

11710,"“This is really funny and everything,” said Harry impatiently,"
11711,"“but joke’s over, all right? Drop it.”"
11712,He turned to leave; he had got two steps toward the door when
11713,"a crashing blow hit him on the right ear. Staggering, he looked"
11714,around. Ron’s fist was drawn right back; his face was contorted
11715,with rage; he was about to strike again.
11716,Harry reacted instinctively; his wand was out of his pocket and
11717,the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought: Levi-
11718,corpus!
11719,Ron yelled as his heel was wrenched upward once more; he dan-
11720,"gled helplessly, upside down, his robes hanging off him."
11721,“What was that for?” Harry bellowed.
11722,"“You insulted her, Harry! You said it was a joke!” shouted Ron,"
11723,who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to
11724,his head.
11725,“This is insane!” said Harry. “What’s got into — ?”
11726,"And then he saw the box lying open on Ron’s bed, and the truth"
11727,hit him with the force of a stampeding troll.
11728,“Where did you get those Chocolate Cauldrons?”
11729,"“They were a birthday present!” shouted Ron, revolving slowly in"
11730,"midair as he struggled to get free. “I offered you one, didn’t I?”"
11731,"“You just picked them up off the floor, didn’t you?”"
11732,"“They’d fallen off my bed, all right? Let me go!”"
11733,"“They didn’t fall off your bed, you prat, don’t you understand?"
11734,"They were mine, I chucked them out of my trunk when I was look-"
11735,"ing for the map, they’re the Chocolate Cauldrons Romilda gave me"
11736,"before Christmas, and they’re all spiked with love potion!”"
11737,But only one word of this seemed to have registered with Ron.
11738, 393   
11739,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11740,“Romilda?” he repeated. “Did you say Romilda? Harry — do
11741,you know her? Can you introduce me?”
11742,"Harry stared at the dangling Ron, whose face now looked"
11743,"tremendously hopeful, and fought a strong desire to laugh. A part"
11744,of him — the part closest to his throbbing right ear — was quite
11745,keen on the idea of letting Ron down and watching him run amok
11746,"until the effects of the potion wore off. . . . But on the other hand,"
11747,"they were supposed to be friends, Ron had not been himself when"
11748,"he had attacked, and Harry thought that he would deserve another"
11749,punching if he permitted Ron to declare undying love for Romilda
11750,Vane.
11751,"“Yeah, I’ll introduce you,” said Harry, thinking fast. “I’m going"
11752,"to let you down now, okay?”"
11753,He sent Ron crashing back to the floor (his ear did hurt quite a
11754,"lot), but Ron simply bounded to his feet again, grinning."
11755,"“She’ll be in Slughorn’s office,” said Harry confidently, leading"
11756,the way to the door.
11757,"“Why will she be in there?” asked Ron anxiously, hurrying to"
11758,keep up.
11759,"“Oh, she has extra Potions lessons with him,” said Harry, in-"
11760,venting wildly.
11761,“Maybe I could ask if I can have them with her?” said Ron
11762,eagerly.
11763,"“Great idea,” said Harry."
11764,"Lavender was waiting beside the portrait hole, a complication"
11765,Harry had not foreseen.
11766,"“You’re late, Won-Won!” she pouted. “I’ve got you a birthday —”"
11767,"“Leave me alone,” said Ron impatiently. “Harry’s going to intro-"
11768,duce me to Romilda Vane.”
11769, 394  
11770,BIRTHDAY SURPRISES
11771,"And without another word to her, he pushed his way out of the"
11772,"portrait hole. Harry tried to make an apologetic face to Lavender,"
11773,"but it might have turned out simply amused, because she looked"
11774,more offended than ever as the Fat Lady swung shut behind them.
11775,Harry had been slightly worried that Slughorn might be at
11776,"breakfast, but he answered his office door at the first knock, wear-"
11777,ing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and look-
11778,ing rather bleary-eyed.
11779,"“Harry,” he mumbled. “This is very early for a call. . . . I gener-"
11780,ally sleep late on a Saturday. . . .”
11781,"“Professor, I’m really sorry to disturb you,” said Harry as quietly"
11782,"as possible, while Ron stood on tiptoe, attempting to see past"
11783,"Slughorn into his room, “but my friend Ron’s swallowed a love po-"
11784,"tion by mistake. You couldn’t make him an antidote, could you? I’d"
11785,"take him to Madam Pomfrey, but we’re not supposed to have any-"
11786,"thing from Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes and, you know . . . awk-"
11787,ward questions . . .”
11788,"“I’d have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy,"
11789,"Harry, an expert potioneer like you?” asked Slughorn."
11790,"“Er,” said Harry, somewhat distracted by the fact that Ron was"
11791,now elbowing him in the ribs in an attempt to force his way into
11792,"the room, “well, I’ve never mixed an antidote for a love potion,"
11793,"sir, and by the time I get it right, Ron might’ve done something"
11794,serious —”
11795,"Helpfully, Ron chose this moment to moan, “I can’t see her,"
11796,Harry — is he hiding her?”
11797,"“Was this potion within date?” asked Slughorn, now eyeing Ron"
11798,"with professional interest. “They can strengthen, you know, the"
11799,longer they’re kept.”
11800,  395  
11801,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11802,"“That would explain a lot,” panted Harry, now positively"
11803,wrestling with Ron to keep him from knocking Slughorn over. “It’s
11804,"his birthday, Professor,” he added imploringly."
11805,"“Oh, all right, come in, then, come in,” said Slughorn, relent-"
11806,"ing. “I’ve got the necessary here in my bag, it’s not a difficult"
11807,antidote. . . .”
11808,"Ron burst through the door into Slughorn’s overheated, crowded"
11809,"study, tripped over a tasseled footstool, regained his balance by seiz-"
11810,"ing Harry around the neck, and muttered, “She didn’t see that, did"
11811,she?”
11812,"“She’s not here yet,” said Harry, watching Slughorn opening his"
11813,potion kit and adding a few pinches of this and that to a small crys-
11814,tal bottle.
11815,"“That’s good,” said Ron fervently. “How do I look?”"
11816,"“Very handsome,” said Slughorn smoothly, handing Ron a glass"
11817,"of clear liquid. “Now drink that up, it’s a tonic for the nerves, keep"
11818,"you calm when she arrives, you know.”"
11819,"“Brilliant,” said Ron eagerly, and he gulped the antidote down"
11820,noisily.
11821,"Harry and Slughorn watched him. For a moment, Ron beamed"
11822,"at them. Then, very slowly, his grin sagged and vanished, to be re-"
11823,placed by an expression of utmost horror.
11824,"“Back to normal, then?” said Harry, grinning. Slughorn chuck-"
11825,"led. “Thanks a lot, Professor.”"
11826,"“Don’t mention it, m’boy, don’t mention it,” said Slughorn, as"
11827,"Ron collapsed into a nearby armchair, looking devastated. “Pick-"
11828,"me-up, that’s what he needs,” Slughorn continued, now bustling"
11829,"over to a table loaded with drinks. “I’ve got butterbeer, I’ve got"
11830,"wine, I’ve got one last bottle of this oak-matured mead . . . hmm . . ."
11831,  396  

11833,"meant to give that to Dumbledore for Christmas . . . ah, well . . .”"
11834,He shrugged. “He can’t miss what he’s never had! Why don’t we
11835,open it now and celebrate Mr. Weasley’s birthday? Nothing like a
11836,fine spirit to chase away the pangs of disappointed love. . . .”
11837,"He chortled again, and Harry joined in. This was the first time"
11838,he had found himself almost alone with Slughorn since his disas-
11839,"trous first attempt to extract the true memory from him. Perhaps,"
11840,if he could just keep Slughorn in a good mood . . . perhaps if they
11841,got through enough of the oak-matured mead . . .
11842,"“There you are then,” said Slughorn, handing Harry and Ron a"
11843,"glass of mead each before raising his own. “Well, a very happy"
11844,"birthday, Ralph —”"
11845,“Ron —” whispered Harry.
11846,"But Ron, who did not appear to be listening to the toast, had al-"
11847,ready thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it.
11848,"There was one second, hardly more than a heartbeat, in which"
11849,"Harry knew there was something terribly wrong and Slughorn, it"
11850,"seemed, did not."
11851,“— and may you have many more —”
11852,“Ron!”
11853,Ron had dropped his glass; he half-rose from his chair and then
11854,"crumpled, his extremities jerking uncontrollably. Foam was drib-"
11855,"bling from his mouth, and his eyes were bulging from their sockets."
11856,“Professor!” Harry bellowed. “Do something!”
11857,But Slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock. Ron twitched and
11858,choked: His skin was turning blue.
11859,“What — but —” spluttered Slughorn.
11860,Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn’s
11861,"open potion kit, pulling out jars and pouches, while the terrible"
11862, 397  
11863,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
11864,sound of Ron’s gargling breath filled the room. Then he found it —
11865,the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in
11866,Potions.
11867,"He hurtled back to Ron’s side, wrenched open his jaw, and"
11868,"thrust the bezoar into his mouth. Ron gave a great shudder, a rat-"
11869,"tling gasp, and his body became limp and still."

11873,"S    o, all in all, not one of Ron’s better birthdays?” said Fred."
11874,"It was evening; the hospital wing was quiet, the windows"
11875,"curtained, the lamps lit. Ron’s was the only occupied bed. Harry,"
11876,"Hermione, and Ginny were sitting around him; they had spent all"
11877,"day waiting outside the double doors, trying to see inside whenever"
11878,somebody went in or out. Madam Pomfrey had only let them en-
11879,ter at eight o’clock. Fred and George had arrived at ten past.
11880,"“This isn’t how we imagined handing over our present,” said"
11881,"George grimly, putting down a large wrapped gift on Ron’s bedside"
11882,cabinet and sitting beside Ginny.
11883,"“Yeah, when we pictured the scene, he was conscious,” said Fred."
11884,"“There we were in Hogsmeade, waiting to surprise him —” said"
11885,George.
11886,"“You were in Hogsmeade?” asked Ginny, looking up."
11887,"“We were thinking of buying Zonko’s,” said Fred gloomily. “A"

11891,you lot aren’t allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore.
11892,. . . But never mind that now.”
11893,He drew up a chair beside Harry and looked at Ron’s pale face.
11894,"“How exactly did it happen, Harry?”"
11895,"Harry retold the story he had already recounted, it felt like a"
11896,"hundred times to Dumbledore, to McGonagall, to Madam Pom-"
11897,"frey, to Hermione, and to Ginny."
11898,“. . . and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing
11899,"eased up a bit, Slughorn ran for help, McGonagall and Madam"
11900,"Pomfrey turned up, and they brought Ron up here. They reckon"
11901,he’ll be all right. Madam Pomfrey says he’ll have to stay here a week
11902,or so . . . keep taking essence of rue . . .”
11903,"“Blimey, it was lucky you thought of a bezoar,” said George in a"
11904,low voice.
11905,"“Lucky there was one in the room,” said Harry, who kept turn-"
11906,ing cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not
11907,been able to lay hands on the little stone.
11908,Hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff. She had been excep-
11909,"tionally quiet all day. Having hurtled, white-faced, up to Harry"
11910,outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had hap-
11911,"pened, she had taken almost no part in Harry and Ginny’s obses-"
11912,"sive discussion about how Ron had been poisoned, but merely"
11913,"stood beside them, clench-jawed and frightened-looking, until at"
11914,last they had been allowed in to see him.
11915,“Do Mum and Dad know?” Fred asked Ginny.
11916,"“They’ve already seen him, they arrived an hour ago — they’re"
11917,"in Dumbledore’s office now, but they’ll be back soon. . . .”"
11918,There was a pause while they all watched Ron mumble a little in
11919,his sleep.
11920, 400   

11922,“So the poison was in the drink?” said Fred quietly.
11923,"“Yes,” said Harry at once; he could think of nothing else and was"
11924,glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again. “Slughorn
11925,poured it out —”
11926,“Would he have been able to slip something into Ron’s glass
11927,without you seeing?”
11928,"“Probably,” said Harry, “but why would Slughorn want to poi-"
11929,son Ron?”
11930,"“No idea,” said Fred, frowning. “You don’t think he could have"
11931,mixed up the glasses by mistake? Meaning to get you?”
11932,“Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry?” asked Ginny.
11933,"“I dunno,” said Fred, “but there must be loads of people who’d"
11934,"like to poison Harry, mustn’t there? ‘The Chosen One’ and all that?”"
11935,“So you think Slughorn’s a Death Eater?” said Ginny.
11936,"“Anything’s possible,” said Fred darkly."
11937,"“He could be under the Imperius Curse,” said George."
11938,"“Or he could be innocent,” said Ginny. “The poison could have"
11939,"been in the bottle, in which case it was probably meant for Slug-"
11940,horn himself.”
11941,“Who’d want to kill Slughorn?”
11942,"“Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side,”"
11943,said Harry. “Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to
11944,Hogwarts. And . . .” He thought of the memory Dumbledore had
11945,not yet been able to extract from Slughorn. “And maybe Voldemort
11946,"wants him out of the way, maybe he thinks he could be valuable to"
11947,Dumbledore.”
11948,“But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to
11949,"Dumbledore for Christmas,” Ginny reminded him. “So the poi-"

11953,"“Then the poisoner didn’t know Slughorn very well,” said Her-"
11954,"mione, speaking for the first time in hours and sounding as though"
11955,she had a bad head cold. “Anyone who knew Slughorn would have
11956,known there was a good chance he’d keep something that tasty for
11957,himself.”
11958,"“Er-my-nee,” croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them."
11959,"They all fell silent, watching him anxiously, but after muttering"
11960,incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring.
11961,"The dormitory doors flew open, making them all jump: Hagrid"
11962,"came striding toward them, his hair rain-flecked, his bearskin coat"
11963,"flapping behind him, a crossbow in his hand, leaving a trail of"
11964,muddy dolphin-sized footprints all over the floor.
11965,"“Bin in the forest all day!” he panted. “Aragog’s worse, I bin"

11969,"“No more than six visitors at a time!” said Madam Pomfrey, hur-"
11970,rying out of her office.
11971,"“Hagrid makes six,” George pointed out."
11972,"“Oh . . . yes . . .” said Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have"
11973,been counting Hagrid as several people due to his vastness. To

11990,"“Well, I don’t think it’s Quidditch, but I think there’s a connec-"

11992,“How d’you work that out?” asked Fred.
11993,"“Well, for one thing, they both ought to have been fatal and"
11994,"weren’t, although that was pure luck. And for another, neither the"
11995,poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was
11996,"supposed to be killed. Of course,” she added broodingly, “that"
11997,"makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way, be-"
11998,cause they don’t seem to care how many people they finish off
11999,before they actually reach their victim.”
12000,"Before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement,"
12001,the dormitory doors opened again and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hur-
12002,ried up the ward. They had done no more than satisfy themselves
12003,that Ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward;
12004,now Mrs. Weasley seized hold of Harry and hugged him very
12005,tightly. “Dumbledore’s told us how you saved him with the be-

12007,. . . you saved Arthur . . . now you’ve saved Ron . . .”
12008,“Don’t be . . . I didn’t . . .” muttered Harry awkwardly.
12009,"“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop"

12013,all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron
12014,"decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express,"
12015,Harry.”
12016,Harry could not think of any reply to this and was almost glad
12017,when Madam Pomfrey reminded them that there were only sup-
12018,posed to be six visitors around Ron’s bed; he and Hermione rose at
12019,"once to leave and Hagrid decided to go with them, leaving Ron"
12020,with his family.
12021,"“It’s terrible,” growled Hagrid into his beard, as the three of"
12022,them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase. “All

12065,"“Well?” Harry urged him, as Hagrid shuffled his enormous feet"
12066,uneasily.
12067,“Well — I jus’ heard Snape sayin’ Dumbledore took too much
12068,fer granted an’ maybe he — Snape — didn’ wan’ ter do it any-
12069,more —”
12070,“Do what?”
12071,"“I dunno, Harry, it sounded like Snape was feelin’ a bit over-"
12072,"worked, tha’s all — anyway, Dumbledore told him flat out he’d"
12073, 405   
12074,CHAPTER NINETEEN
12075,agreed ter do it an’ that was all there was to it. Pretty firm with him.
12076,An’ then he said summat abou’ Snape makin’ investigations in his
12077,"House, in Slytherin. Well, there’s nothin’ strange abou’ that!” Ha-"
12078,"grid added hastily, as Harry and Hermione exchanged looks full of"
12079,meaning. “All the Heads o’ Houses were asked ter look inter that
12080,necklace business —”
12081,"“Yeah, but Dumbledore’s not having rows with the rest of them,"
12082,is he?” said Harry.
12083,"“Look,” Hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his"
12084,hands; there was a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two. “I
12085,"know what yeh’re like abou’ Snape, Harry, an’ I don’ want yeh ter"
12086,go readin’ more inter this than there is.”
12087,"“Look out,” said Hermione tersely."
12088,They turned just in time to see the shadow of Argus Filch loom-
12089,ing over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the
12090,"corner, hunchbacked, his jowls aquiver."
12091,"“Oho!” he wheezed. “Out of bed so late, this’ll mean detention!”"
12092,"“No it won’, Filch,” said Hagrid shortly. “They’re with me, aren’"
12093,they?”
12094,“And what difference does that make?” asked Filch obnoxiously.
12095,"“I’m a ruddy teacher, aren’ I, yeh sneakin’ Squib!” said Hagrid,"
12096,firing up at once.
12097,There was a nasty hissing noise as Filch swelled with fury; Mrs.
12098,"Norris had arrived, unseen, and was twisting herself sinuously"
12099,around Filch’s skinny ankles.
12100,"“Get goin’,” said Hagrid out of the corner of his mouth."
12101,Harry did not need telling twice; he and Hermione both hurried
12102,off; Hagrid’s and Filch’s raised voices echoed behind them as they
12103,  406   
12104,ELF TAILS
12105,"ran. They passed Peeves near the turning into Gryffindor Tower,"
12106,"but he was streaking happily toward the source of the yelling, cack-"
12107,"ling and calling,"
12108,When there’s strife and when there’s trouble
12109,"Call on Peevsie, he’ll make double!"
12110,"The Fat Lady was snoozing and not pleased to be woken, but"
12111,swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the merci-
12112,fully peaceful and empty common room. It did not seem that peo-
12113,ple knew about Ron yet; Harry was very relieved: He had been
12114,interrogated enough that day. Hermione bade him good night and
12115,"set off for the girls’ dormitory. Harry, however, remained behind,"
12116,taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying
12117,embers.
12118,So Dumbledore had argued with Snape. In spite of all he had
12119,"told Harry, in spite of his insistence that he trusted Snape com-"
12120,"pletely, he had lost his temper with him. . . . He did not think that"
12121,"Snape had tried hard enough to investigate the Slytherins . . . or,"
12122,"perhaps, to investigate a single Slytherin: Malfoy?"
12123,Was it because Dumbledore did not want Harry to do anything
12124,"foolish, to take matters into his own hands, that he had pretended"
12125,there was nothing in Harry’s suspicions? That seemed likely. It
12126,might even be that Dumbledore did not want anything to distract
12127,"Harry from their lessons, or from procuring that memory from"
12128,Slughorn. Perhaps Dumbledore did not think it right to confide
12129,suspicions about his staff to sixteen-year-olds. . . .
12130,"“There you are, Potter!”"
12131,  407  
12132,CHAPTER NINETEEN
12133,"Harry jumped to his feet in shock, his wand at the ready. He had"
12134,been quite convinced that the common room was empty; he had
12135,not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of
12136,a distant chair. A closer look showed him that it was Cormac
12137,McLaggen.
12138,"“I’ve been waiting for you to come back,” said McLaggen, disre-"
12139,"garding Harry’s drawn wand. “Must’ve fallen asleep. Look, I saw"
12140,them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier. Didn’t look
12141,like he’ll be fit for next week’s match.”
12142,It took Harry a few moments to realize what McLaggen was
12143,talking about.
12144,"“Oh . . . right . . . Quidditch,” he said, putting his wand back"
12145,into the belt of his jeans and running a hand wearily through his
12146,hair. “Yeah . . . he might not make it.”
12147,"“Well, then, I’ll be playing Keeper, won’t I?” said McLaggen."
12148,"“Yeah,” said Harry. “Yeah, I suppose so. . . .”"
12149,"He could not think of an argument against it; after all,"
12150,McLaggen had certainly performed second-best in the trials.
12151,"“Excellent,” said McLaggen in a satisfied voice. “So when’s prac-"
12152,tice?”
12153,“What? Oh . . . there’s one tomorrow evening.”
12154,"“Good. Listen, Potter, we should have a talk beforehand. I’ve got"
12155,some ideas on strategy you might find useful.”
12156,"“Right,” said Harry unenthusiastically. “Well, I’ll hear them to-"
12157,"morrow, then. I’m pretty tired now . . . see you . . .”"
12158,"The news that Ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day,"
12159,but it did not cause the sensation that Katie’s attack had done. Peo-
12160,"ple seemed to think that it might have been an accident, given that"
12161,"he had been in the Potions master’s room at the time, and that as"
12162, 408  
12163,ELF TAILS
12164,he had been given an antidote immediately there was no real harm
12165,"done. In fact, the Gryffindors were generally much more interested"
12166,"in the upcoming Quidditch match against Hufflepuff, for many of"
12167,"them wanted to see Zacharias Smith, who played Chaser on the"
12168,"Hufflepuff team, punished soundly for his commentary during the"
12169,opening match against Slytherin.
12170,"Harry, however, had never been less interested in Quidditch; he"
12171,was rapidly becoming obsessed with Draco Malfoy. Still checking
12172,"the Marauder’s Map whenever he got a chance, he sometimes"
12173,"made detours to wherever Malfoy happened to be, but had not yet"
12174,detected him doing anything out of the ordinary. And still there
12175,were those inexplicable times when Malfoy simply vanished from
12176,the map. . . .
12177,"But Harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem,"
12178,"what with Quidditch practice, homework, and the fact that he was"
12179,now being dogged wherever he went by Cormac McLaggen and
12180,Lavender Brown.
12181,He could not decide which of them was more annoying.
12182,McLaggen kept up a constant stream of hints that he would make
12183,"a better permanent Keeper for the team than Ron, and that now"
12184,that Harry was seeing him play regularly he would surely come
12185,around to this way of thinking too; he was also keen to criticize the
12186,"other players and provide Harry with detailed training schemes, so"
12187,that more than once Harry was forced to remind him who was
12188,Captain.
12189,"Meanwhile, Lavender kept sidling up to Harry to discuss Ron,"
12190,which Harry found almost more wearing than McLaggen’s Quid-
12191,"ditch lectures. At first, Lavender had been very annoyed that"
12192,nobody had thought to tell her that Ron was in the hospital
12193, 409   
12194,CHAPTER NINETEEN
12195,"wing — “I mean, I am his girlfriend!” — but unfortunately she"
12196,had now decided to forgive Harry this lapse of memory and was
12197,"keen to have lots of in-depth chats with him about Ron’s feelings,"
12198,a most uncomfortable experience that Harry would have happily
12199,forgone.
12200,"“Look, why don’t you talk to Ron about all this?” Harry asked,"
12201,after a particularly long interrogation from Lavender that took in
12202,everything from precisely what Ron had said about her new dress
12203,robes to whether or not Harry thought that Ron considered his re-
12204,lationship with Lavender to be “serious.”
12205,"“Well, I would, but he’s always asleep when I go and see him!”"
12206,said Lavender fretfully.
12207,"“Is he?” said Harry, surprised, for he had found Ron perfectly"
12208,"alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing, both highly"
12209,interested in the news of Dumbledore and Snape’s row and keen to
12210,abuse McLaggen as much as possible.
12211,“Is Hermione Granger still visiting him?” Lavender demanded
12212,suddenly.
12213,"“Yeah, I think so. Well, they’re friends, aren’t they?” said Harry"
12214,uncomfortably.
12215,"“Friends, don’t make me laugh,” said Lavender scornfully. “She"
12216,didn’t talk to him for weeks after he started going out with me!
12217,But I suppose she wants to make up with him now he’s all inter-
12218,esting. . . .”
12219,“Would you call getting poisoned being interesting?” asked
12220,"Harry. “Anyway — sorry, got to go — there’s McLaggen coming"
12221,"for a talk about Quidditch,” said Harry hurriedly, and he dashed"
12222,sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted
12223, 410    
12224,ELF TAILS
12225,"down the shortcut that would take him off to Potions where,"
12226,"thankfully, neither Lavender nor McLaggen could follow him."
12227,"On the morning of the Quidditch match against Hufflepuff,"
12228,Harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the
12229,pitch. Ron was very agitated; Madam Pomfrey would not let him
12230,"go down to watch the match, feeling it would overexcite him."
12231,"“So how’s McLaggen shaping up?” he asked Harry nervously, ap-"
12232,parently forgetting that he had already asked the same question
12233,twice.
12234,"“I’ve told you,” said Harry patiently, “he could be world-class"
12235,and I wouldn’t want to keep him. He keeps trying to tell everyone
12236,"what to do, he thinks he could play every position better than the"
12237,rest of us. I can’t wait to be shot of him. And speaking of getting
12238,"shot of people,” Harry added, getting to his feet and picking up his"
12239,"Firebolt, “will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender"
12240,comes to see you? She’s driving me mad as well.”
12241,"“Oh,” said Ron, looking sheepish. “Yeah. All right.”"
12242,"“If you don’t want to go out with her anymore, just tell her,” said"
12243,Harry.
12244,"“Yeah . . . well . . . it’s not that easy, is it?” said Ron. He paused."
12245,“Hermione going to look in before the match?” he added casually.
12246,"“No, she’s already gone down to the pitch with Ginny.”"
12247,"“Oh,” said Ron, looking rather glum. “Right. Well, good luck."
12248,"Hope you hammer McLag — I mean, Smith.”"
12249,"“I’ll try,” said Harry, shouldering his broom. “See you after the"
12250,match.”
12251,He hurried down through the deserted corridors; the whole
12252,"school was outside, either already seated in the stadium or heading"
12253, 411   
12254,CHAPTER NINETEEN
12255,"down toward it. He was looking out of the windows he passed, try-"
12256,"ing to gauge how much wind they were facing, when a noise ahead"
12257,"made him glance up and he saw Malfoy walking toward him, ac-"
12258,"companied by two girls, both of whom looked sulky and resentful."
12259,"Malfoy stopped short at the sight of Harry, then gave a short,"
12260,humorless laugh and continued walking.
12261,“Where’re you going?” Harry demanded.
12262,"“Yeah, I’m really going to tell you, because it’s your business,"
12263,"Potter,” sneered Malfoy. “You’d better hurry up, they’ll be waiting"
12264,for ‘the Chosen Captain’ — ‘the Boy Who Scored’ — whatever
12265,they call you these days.”
12266,One of the girls gave an unwilling giggle. Harry stared at her.
12267,She blushed. Malfoy pushed past Harry and she and her friend fol-
12268,"lowed at a trot, turning the corner and vanishing from view."
12269,Harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear.
12270,This was infuriating; he was already cutting it fine to get to the
12271,"match on time and yet there was Malfoy, skulking off while the rest"
12272,of the school was absent: Harry’s best chance yet of discovering
12273,"what Malfoy was up to. The silent seconds trickled past, and Harry"
12274,"remained where he was, frozen, gazing at the place where Malfoy"
12275,had vanished. . . .
12276,"“Where have you been?” demanded Ginny, as Harry sprinted"
12277,into the changing rooms. The whole team was changed and ready;
12278,"Coote and Peakes, the Beaters, were both hitting their clubs ner-"
12279,vously against their legs.
12280,"“I met Malfoy,” Harry told her quietly, as he pulled his scarlet"
12281,robes over his head.
12282,“So?”
12283, 412   
12284,ELF TAILS
12285,“So I wanted to know how come he’s up at the castle with a cou-
12286,ple of girlfriends while everyone else is down here. . . .”
12287,“Does it matter right now?”
12288,"“Well, I’m not likely to find out, am I?” said Harry, seizing his"
12289,Firebolt and pushing his glasses straight. “Come on then!”
12290,"And without another word, he marched out onto the pitch to"
12291,deafening cheers and boos.
12292,There was little wind; the clouds were patchy; every now and
12293,then there were dazzling flashes of bright sunlight.
12294,“Tricky conditions!” McLaggen said bracingly to the team.
12295,"“Coote, Peakes, you’ll want to fly out of the sun, so they don’t see"
12296,you coming —”
12297,"“I’m the Captain, McLaggen, shut up giving them instructions,”"
12298,said Harry angrily. “Just get up by the goal posts!”
12299,"Once McLaggen had marched off, Harry turned to Coote and"
12300,Peakes.
12301,"“Make sure you do fly out of the sun,” he told them grudgingly."
12302,"He shook hands with the Hufflepuff Captain, and then, on"
12303,"Madam Hooch’s whistle, kicked off and rose into the air, higher"
12304,"than the rest of his team, streaking around the pitch in search of the"
12305,"Snitch. If he could catch it good and early, there might be a chance"
12306,"he could get back up to the castle, seize the Marauder’s Map, and"
12307,find out what Malfoy was doing. . . .
12308,"“And that’s Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle,” said a dreamy"
12309,"voice, echoing over the grounds. “He did the commentary last"
12310,"time, of course, and Ginny Weasley flew into him, I think proba-"
12311,"bly on purpose, it looked like it. Smith was being quite rude about"
12312,"Gryffindor, I expect he regrets that now he’s playing them — oh,"
12313, 413   
12314,CHAPTER NINETEEN
12315,"look, he’s lost the Quaffle, Ginny took it from him, I do like her,"
12316,she’s very nice. . . .”
12317,Harry stared down at the commentator’s podium. Surely no-
12318,body in their right mind would have let Luna Lovegood commen-
12319,"tate? But even from above there was no mistaking that long,"
12320,"dirty-blonde hair, nor the necklace of butterbeer corks. . . . Beside"
12321,"Luna, Professor McGonagall was looking slightly uncomfortable,"
12322,as though she was indeed having second thoughts about this
12323,appointment.
12324,“. . . but now that big Hufflepuff player’s got the Quaffle from
12325,"her, I can’t remember his name, it’s something like Bibble — no,"
12326,Buggins —”
12327,“It’s Cadwallader!” said Professor McGonagall loudly from be-
12328,side Luna. The crowd laughed.
12329,Harry stared around for the Snitch; there was no sign of it. Mo-
12330,"ments later, Cadwallader scored. McLaggen had been shouting"
12331,"criticism at Ginny for allowing the Quaffle out of her possession,"
12332,with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring
12333,past his right ear.
12334,"“McLaggen, will you pay attention to what you’re supposed to"
12335,"be doing and leave everyone else alone!” bellowed Harry, wheeling"
12336,around to face his Keeper.
12337,"“You’re not setting a great example!” McLaggen shouted back,"
12338,red-faced and furious.
12339,"“And Harry Potter’s now having an argument with his Keeper,”"
12340,"said Luna serenely, while both Hufflepuffs and Slytherins below in"
12341,the crowd cheered and jeered. “I don’t think that’ll help him find
12342,"the Snitch, but maybe it’s a clever ruse. . . .”"
12343, 414   
12344,ELF TAILS
12345,"Swearing angrily, Harry spun round and set off around the pitch"
12346,"again, scanning the skies for some sign of the tiny, winged golden"
12347,ball.
12348,"Ginny and Demelza scored a goal apiece, giving the red-and-"
12349,gold-clad supporters below something to cheer about. Then Cad-
12350,"wallader scored again, making things level, but Luna did not seem"
12351,to have noticed; she appeared singularly uninterested in such mun-
12352,"dane things as the score, and kept attempting to draw the crowd’s"
12353,attention to such things as interestingly shaped clouds and the pos-
12354,"sibility that Zacharias Smith, who had so far failed to maintain"
12355,"possession of the Quaffle for longer than a minute, was suffering"
12356,from something called “Loser’s Lurgy.”
12357,“Seventy-forty to Hufflepuff!” barked Professor McGonagall
12358,into Luna’s megaphone.
12359,"“Is it, already?” said Luna vaguely. “Oh, look! The Gryffindor"
12360,Keeper’s got hold of one of the Beater’s bats.”
12361,"Harry spun around in midair. Sure enough, McLaggen, for rea-"
12362,"sons best known to himself, had pulled Peakes’s bat from him and"
12363,appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a Bludger toward an on-
12364,coming Cadwallader.
12365,“Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts!”
12366,"roared Harry, pelting toward McLaggen just as McLaggen took a"
12367,ferocious swipe at the Bludger and mishit it.
12368,"A blinding, sickening pain . . . a flash of light . . . distant"
12369,screams . . . and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel . . .
12370,"And the next thing Harry knew, he was lying in a remarkably"
12371,warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that was
12372,throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling. He raised
12373, 415    
12374,CHAPTER NINETEEN
12375,"his head awkwardly. There on his left was a familiar-looking,"
12376,"freckly, red-haired person."
12377,"“Nice of you to drop in,” said Ron, grinning."
12378,Harry blinked and looked around. Of course: He was in the hos-
12379,pital wing. The sky outside was indigo streaked with crimson. The
12380,match must have finished hours ago . . . as had any hope of cor-
12381,nering Malfoy. Harry’s head felt strangely heavy; he raised a hand
12382,and felt a stiff turban of bandages.
12383,“What happened?”
12384,"“Cracked skull,” said Madam Pomfrey, bustling up and pushing"
12385,"him back against his pillows. “Nothing to worry about, I mended"
12386,"it at once, but I’m keeping you in overnight. You shouldn’t over-"
12387,exert yourself for a few hours.”
12388,"“I don’t want to stay here overnight,” said Harry angrily, sitting"
12389,up and throwing back his covers. “I want to find McLaggen and
12390,kill him.”
12391,“I’m afraid that would come under the heading of ‘overexer-
12392,"tion,’ ” said Madam Pomfrey, pushing him firmly back onto the bed"
12393,and raising her wand in a threatening manner. “You will stay here
12394,"until I discharge you, Potter, or I shall call the headmaster.”"
12395,"She bustled back into her office, and Harry sank back into his"
12396,"pillows, fuming."
12397,“D’you know how much we lost by?” he asked Ron through
12398,clenched teeth.
12399,"“Well, yeah I do,” said Ron apologetically. “Final score was three"
12400,hundred and twenty to sixty.”
12401,"“Brilliant,” said Harry savagely. “Really brilliant! When I get"
12402,hold of McLaggen —”
12403,"“You don’t want to get hold of him, he’s the size of a troll,” said"
12404, 416   
12405,ELF TAILS
12406,"Ron reasonably. “Personally, I think there’s a lot to be said for hex-"
12407,"ing him with that toenail thing of the Prince’s. Anyway, the rest of"
12408,"the team might’ve dealt with him before you get out of here, they’re"
12409,not happy. . . .”
12410,There was a note of badly suppressed glee in Ron’s voice; Harry
12411,could tell he was nothing short of thrilled that McLaggen had
12412,"messed up so badly. Harry lay there, staring up at the patch of light"
12413,"on the ceiling, his recently mended skull not hurting, precisely, but"
12414,feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging.
12415,"“I could hear the match commentary from here,” said Ron, his"
12416,voice now shaking with laughter. “I hope Luna always commen-
12417,tates from now on. . . . Loser’s Lurgy . . .”
12418,But Harry was still too angry to see much humor in the situa-
12419,"tion, and after a while Ron’s snorts subsided."
12420,"“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said,"
12421,"after a long pause, and Harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive,"
12422,"rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his life-"
12423,"less form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while"
12424,Ron gave them his blessing. . . . “She reckons you only just arrived
12425,on time for the match. How come? You left here early enough.”
12426,"“Oh . . .” said Harry, as the scene in his mind’s eye imploded."
12427,"“Yeah . . . well, I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls"
12428,"who didn’t look like they wanted to be with him, and that’s the sec-"
12429,ond time he’s made sure he isn’t down on the Quidditch pitch with
12430,"the rest of the school; he skipped the last match too, remember?”"
12431,"Harry sighed. “Wish I’d followed him now, the match was such a"

12442,saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this

12446,where’s he going when he disappears off the map?”
12447,"“I dunno . . . Hogsmeade?” suggested Ron, yawning."
12448,“I’ve never seen him going along any of the secret passageways

12453,"If only he had Rufus Scrimgeour’s power, he would have been"

12455,have an office full of Aurors at his command. . . . He thought fleet-
12456,"ingly of trying to set something up with the D.A., but there again"
12457,was the problem that people would be missed from lessons; most of
12458,"them, after all, still had full schedules. . . ."
12459,"There was a low, rumbling snore from Ron’s bed. After a while"
12460,"Madam Pomfrey came out of her office, this time wearing a thick"
12461,dressing gown. It was easiest to feign sleep; Harry rolled over onto

12472,Lockhart. . . . That had been his most painful injury by far . . . he

12480,"But the question was, how to call him? What did you do?"
12481,"Quietly, tentatively, Harry spoke into the darkness."
12482,“Kreacher?”
12483,"There was a very loud crack, and the sounds of scuffling and"

12503,"“— kicky, scratchy!” cried Peeves happily, now pelting bits of"

12505,"“Kreacher will say what he likes about his master, oh yes, and"

12512,"though they continued to try and kick and punch each other,"

12536,as he gave Harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death.

12548,"“Come to think of it, it would be good to have both of you,”"
12549,said Harry. “Okay then . . . I want you to tail Draco Malfoy.”
12550,Ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on Ron’s
12551,"face, Harry went on, “I want to know where he’s going, who he’s"
12552,"meeting, and what he’s doing. I want you to follow him around the"

12558,"himself off the topmost tower, Harry Potter!”"
12559,"“There won’t be any need for that,” said Harry hastily."
12560,“Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys?”
12561,croaked Kreacher. “Master wants me to spy upon the pure-blood
12562,great-nephew of my old mistress?”
12563,"“That’s the one,” said Harry, foreseeing a great danger and de-"

12568,He thought he could see Kreacher struggling to see a loophole in
12569,the instructions he had just been given and waited. After a moment
12570,"or two, and to Harry’s great satisfaction, Kreacher bowed deeply"

12638,"“You’re making fun of me, aren’t you?” she said. “Everyone says"

12668,"“Thanks a lot, Hermione,” said Harry, giving her a hasty pat on"

12697,she had tripped over one of her trailing shawls.
12698,"“Please close the door and sit down, Harry,” said Dumbledore,"
12699,sounding rather tired.

12701,"Dumbledore’s desk that the Pensieve lay between them once more,"
12702,as did two more tiny crystal bottles full of swirling memory.
12703,"“Professor Trelawney still isn’t happy Firenze is teaching, then?”"
12704,Harry asked.
12705,"“No,” said Dumbledore, “Divination is turning out to be much"
12706,"more trouble than I could have foreseen, never having studied the"

12715,cuss. Firstly — have you managed the task I set you at the end of
12716,our previous lesson?”
12717,"“Ah,” said Harry, brought up short. What with Apparition"
12718,lessons and Quidditch and Ron being poisoned and getting his skull
12719,cracked and his determination to find out what Draco Malfoy was

12724,"Professor Slughorn about it at the end of Potions, sir, but, er, he"
12725,wouldn’t give it to me.”
12726,There was a little silence.
12727,"“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the"
12728,top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensa-
12729,tion that he was being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted
12730,"your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exer-"
12731,cised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth
12732,of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?”
12733,"“Well,” Harry stalled, at a loss for what to say next. His single at-"
12734,tempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly
12735,feeble. “Well . . . the day Ron swallowed love potion by mistake I
12736,took him to Professor Slughorn. I thought maybe if I got Professor
12737,Slughorn in a good enough mood —”
12738,“And did that work?” asked Dumbledore.
12739,"“Well, no, sir, because Ron got poisoned —”"
12740,"“— which, naturally, made you forget all about trying to retrieve"
12741,"the memory; I would have expected nothing else, while your best"
12742,friend was in danger. Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was

12766,I should have realized you wouldn’t have asked me to do it if it

12768,"“Thank you for saying that, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly."
12769,"“May I hope, then, that you will give this matter higher priority"
12770,from now on? There will be little point in our meeting after tonight
12771,unless we have that memory.”

12776,"“Yes, sir,” said Harry quickly. “Voldemort killed his father and"

12788,the age of seventeen?”
12789,Harry nodded.
12790,"“But now, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “now things become"
12791,murkier and stranger. If it was difficult to find evidence about the
12792,"boy Riddle, it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared"
12793,"to reminisce about the man Voldemort. In fact, I doubt whether"
12794,"there is a soul alive, apart from himself, who could give us a full ac-"

12801,Harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task
12802,"of retrieving the Horcrux memory, and he shifted guiltily in his"
12803,seat as Dumbledore raised the first of the two bottles to the light
12804,and examined it.
12805,"“I hope you are not tired of diving into other people’s memories,"
12806,"for they are curious recollections, these two,” he said. “This first"
12807,one came from a very old house-elf by the name of Hokey. Before
12808,"we see what Hokey witnessed, I must quickly recount how Lord"
12809,Voldemort left Hogwarts.
12810,"“He reached the seventh year of his schooling with, as you might"
12811,"have expected, top grades in every examination he had taken. All"
12812,"around him, his classmates were deciding which jobs they were to"
12813,pursue once they had left Hogwarts. Nearly everybody expected
12814,"spectacular things from Tom Riddle, prefect, Head Boy, winner of"
12815, 430  
12816,LORD VOLDEMORT’S
12817,REQUEST
12818,the Award for Special Services to the School. I know that several
12819,"teachers, Professor Slughorn amongst them, suggested that he join"
12820,"the Ministry of Magic, offered to set up appointments, put him in"
12821,touch with useful contacts. He refused all offers. The next thing the
12822,"staff knew, Voldemort was working at Borgin and Burkes.”"
12823,"“At Borgin and Burkes?” Harry repeated, stunned."
12824,"“At Borgin and Burkes,” repeated Dumbledore calmly. “I think"
12825,you will see what attractions the place held for him when we have
12826,entered Hokey’s memory. But this was not Voldemort’s first choice
12827,of job. Hardly anyone knew of it at the time — I was one of the
12828,few in whom the then headmaster confided — but Voldemort first
12829,approached Professor Dippet and asked whether he could remain
12830,at Hogwarts as a teacher.”
12831,"“He wanted to stay here? Why?” asked Harry, more amazed still."
12832,"“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of"
12833,"them to Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very"
12834,"importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school"
12835,than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been
12836,happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.”
12837,"Harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these words, for this was ex-"
12838,actly how he felt about Hogwarts too.
12839,"“Secondly, the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic. Undoubt-"
12840,edly Voldemort had penetrated many more of its secrets than most
12841,"of the students who pass through the place, but he may have felt"
12842,"that there were still mysteries to unravel, stores of magic to tap."
12843,"“And thirdly, as a teacher, he would have had great power and in-"
12844,fluence over young witches and wizards. Perhaps he had gained the
12845,"idea from Professor Slughorn, the teacher with whom he was on"
12846,"best terms, who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher"
12847,  431  
12848,CHAPTER TWENTY
12849,can play. I do not imagine for an instant that Voldemort envisaged
12850,"spending the rest of his life at Hogwarts, but I do think that he saw"
12851,"it as a useful recruiting ground, and a place where he might begin"
12852,to build himself an army.”
12853,"“But he didn’t get the job, sir?”"
12854,"“No, he did not. Professor Dippet told him that he was too"
12855,"young at eighteen, but invited him to reapply in a few years, if he"
12856,still wished to teach.”
12857,"“How did you feel about that, sir?” asked Harry hesitantly."
12858,"“Deeply uneasy,” said Dumbledore. “I had advised Armando"
12859,against the appointment — I did not give the reasons I have given
12860,"you, for Professor Dippet was very fond of Voldemort and con-"
12861,vinced of his honesty. But I did not want Lord Voldemort back at
12862,"this school, and especially not in a position of power.”"
12863,"“Which job did he want, sir? What subject did he want to"
12864,teach?”
12865,"Somehow, Harry knew the answer even before Dumbledore"
12866,gave it.
12867,“Defense Against the Dark Arts. It was being taught at the time
12868,"by an old Professor by the name of Galatea Merrythought, who"
12869,had been at Hogwarts for nearly fifty years.
12870,"“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff"
12871,"who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young"
12872,"wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no"
12873,"mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given"
12874,particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and
12875,"Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with un-"
12876,usual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade
12877, 432 
12878,LORD VOLDEMORT’S
12879,REQUEST
12880,"people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he"
12881,"was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.”"
12882,"“I’ll bet he was,” said Harry, unable to contain himself."
12883,"“Well, quite,” said Dumbledore, with a faint smile. “And now it"
12884,"is time to hear from Hokey the house-elf, who worked for a very"
12885,"old, very rich witch by the name of Hepzibah Smith.”"
12886,"Dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand, the cork flew out,"
12887,"and he tipped the swirling memory into the Pensieve, saying as he"
12888,"did so, “After you, Harry.”"
12889,Harry got to his feet and bent once more over the rippling silver
12890,contents of the stone basin until his face touched them. He tum-
12891,bled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in
12892,front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig
12893,"and a brilliant pink set of robes that flowed all around her, giving"
12894,her the look of a melting iced cake. She was looking into a small
12895,jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheeks
12896,"with a large powder puff, while the tiniest and oldest house-elf"
12897,Harry had ever seen laced her fleshy feet into tight satin slippers.
12898,"“Hurry up, Hokey!” said Hepzibah imperiously. “He said he’d"
12899,"come at four, it’s only a couple of minutes to and he’s never been"
12900,late yet!”
12901,She tucked away her powder puff as the house-elf straightened
12902,up. The top of the elf ’s head barely reached the seat of Hepzibah’s
12903,"chair, and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp"
12904,linen sheet she wore draped like a toga.
12905,"“How do I look?” said Hepzibah, turning her head to admire the"
12906,various angles of her face in the mirror.
12907,"“Lovely, madam,” squeaked Hokey."
12908, 433  
12909,CHAPTER TWENTY
12910,Harry could only assume that it was down in Hokey’s contract
12911,"that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question, be-"
12912,cause Hepzibah Smith looked a long way from lovely in his
12913,opinion.
12914,A tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped.
12915,"“Quick, quick, he’s here, Hokey!” cried Hepzibah and the elf"
12916,"scurried out of the room, which was so crammed with objects that"
12917,it was difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across
12918,it without knocking over at least a dozen things: There were cabi-
12919,"nets full of little lacquered boxes, cases full of gold-embossed"
12920,"books, shelves of orbs and celestial globes, and many flourishing"
12921,"potted plants in brass containers. In fact, the room looked like a"
12922,cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory.
12923,"The house-elf returned within minutes, followed by a tall young"
12924,man Harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing as Volde-
12925,mort. He was plainly dressed in a black suit; his hair was a little
12926,"longer than it had been at school and his cheeks were hollowed, but"
12927,all of this suited him; he looked more handsome than ever. He
12928,picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed
12929,he had visited many times before and bowed low over Hepzibah’s
12930,"fat little hand, brushing it with his lips."
12931,"“I brought you flowers,” he said quietly, producing a bunch of"
12932,roses from nowhere.
12933,"“You naughty boy, you shouldn’t have!” squealed old Hepzibah,"
12934,though Harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready
12935,"on the nearest little table. “You do spoil this old lady, Tom. . . . Sit"
12936,"down, sit down. . . . Where’s Hokey? Ah . . .”"
12937,The house-elf had come dashing back into the room carrying a
12938,"tray of little cakes, which she set at her mistress’s elbow."

12942,"“Help yourself, Tom,” said Hepzibah, “I know how you love my"
12943,"cakes. Now, how are you? You look pale. They overwork you at that"
12944,"shop, I’ve said it a hundred times. . . .”"
12945,Voldemort smiled mechanically and Hepzibah simpered.
12946,"“Well, what’s your excuse for visiting this time?” she asked, bat-"
12947,ting her lashes.
12948,“Mr. Burke would like to make an improved offer for the gob-
12949,"lin-made armor,” said Voldemort. “Five hundred Galleons, he feels"
12950,it is a more than fair —”
12951,"“Now, now, not so fast, or I’ll think you’re only here for my trin-"
12952,kets!” pouted Hepzibah.
12953,"“I am ordered here because of them,” said Voldemort quietly. “I"
12954,"am only a poor assistant, madam, who must do as he is told. Mr."
12955,Burke wishes me to inquire —”
12956,"“Oh, Mr. Burke, phooey!” said Hepzibah, waving a little hand."
12957,“I’ve something to show you that I’ve never shown Mr. Burke! Can
12958,"you keep a secret, Tom? Will you promise you won’t tell Mr. Burke"
12959,"I’ve got it? He’d never let me rest if he knew I’d shown it to you,"
12960,"and I’m not selling, not to Burke, not to anyone! But you, Tom,"
12961,"you’ll appreciate it for its history, not how many Galleons you can"
12962,get for it.”
12963,"“I’d be glad to see anything Miss Hepzibah shows me,” said"
12964,"Voldemort quietly, and Hepzibah gave another girlish giggle."
12965,"“I had Hokey bring it out for me. . . . Hokey, where are you? I"
12966,"want to show Mr. Riddle our finest treasure. . . . In fact, bring both,"
12967,while you’re at it. . . .”
12968,"“Here, madam,” squeaked the house-elf, and Harry saw two"
12969,"leather boxes, one on top of the other, moving across the room as if"
12970,"of their own volition, though he knew the tiny elf was holding"
12971, 435   
12972,CHAPTER TWENTY
12973,"them over her head as she wended her way between tables, pouffes,"
12974,and footstools.
12975,"“Now,” said Hepzibah happily, taking the boxes from the elf,"
12976,"laying them in her lap, and preparing to open the topmost one, “I"
12977,"think you’ll like this, Tom. . . . Oh, if my family knew I was show-"
12978,ing you. . . . They can’t wait to get their hands on this!”
12979,She opened the lid. Harry edged forward a little to get a better
12980,view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely
12981,wrought handles.
12982,"“I wonder whether you know what it is, Tom? Pick it up, have a"
12983,"good look!” whispered Hepzibah, and Voldemort stretched out a"
12984,long-fingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of its snug
12985,silken wrappings. Harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark
12986,eyes. His greedy expression was curiously mirrored on Hepzibah’s
12987,"face, except that her tiny eyes were fixed upon Voldemort’s hand-"
12988,some features.
12989,"“A badger,” murmured Voldemort, examining the engraving"
12990,upon the cup. “Then this was . . . ?”
12991,"“Helga Hufflepuff ’s, as you very well know, you clever boy!” said"
12992,"Hepzibah, leaning forward with a loud creaking of corsets and ac-"
12993,tually pinching his hollow cheek. “Didn’t I tell you I was distantly
12994,descended? This has been handed down in the family for years and
12995,"years. Lovely, isn’t it? And all sorts of powers it’s supposed to pos-"
12996,"sess too, but I haven’t tested them thoroughly, I just keep it nice"
12997,and safe in here. . . .”
12998,She hooked the cup back off Voldemort’s long forefinger and re-
12999,"stored it gently to its box, too intent upon settling it carefully back"
13000,into position to notice the shadow that crossed Voldemort’s face as
13001,the cup was taken away.

13005,"“Now then,” said Hepzibah happily, “where’s Hokey? Oh yes,"
13006,"there you are — take that away now, Hokey.”"
13007,"The elf obediently took the boxed cup, and Hepzibah turned"
13008,her attention to the much flatter box in her lap.
13009,"“I think you’ll like this even more, Tom,” she whispered. “Lean"
13010,"in a little, dear boy, so you can see. . . . Of course, Burke knows I’ve"
13011,"got this one, I bought it from him, and I daresay he’d love to get it"
13012,back when I’m gone. . . .”
13013,She slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box.
13014,There upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket.
13015,"Voldemort reached out his hand, without invitation this time,"
13016,"and held it up to the light, staring at it."
13017,"“Slytherin’s mark,” he said quietly, as the light played upon an"
13018,"ornate, serpentine S."
13019,"“That’s right!” said Hepzibah, delighted, apparently, at the sight"
13020,"of Voldemort gazing at her locket, transfixed. “I had to pay an arm"
13021,"and a leg for it, but I couldn’t let it pass, not a real treasure like that,"
13022,"had to have it for my collection. Burke bought it, apparently, from"
13023,"a ragged-looking woman who seemed to have stolen it, but had no"
13024,idea of its true value —”
13025,There was no mistaking it this time: Voldemort’s eyes flashed
13026,"scarlet at the words, and Harry saw his knuckles whiten on the"
13027,locket’s chain.
13028,“— I daresay Burke paid her a pittance but there you are. . . .
13029,"Pretty, isn’t it? And again, all kinds of powers attributed to it,"
13030,though I just keep it nice and safe. . . .”
13031,"She reached out to take the locket back. For a moment, Harry"
13032,"thought Voldemort was not going to let go of it, but then it had"
13033,slid through his fingers and was back in its red velvet cushion.
13034,  437   
13035,CHAPTER TWENTY
13036,"“So there you are, Tom, dear, and I hope you enjoyed that!”"
13037,"She looked him full in the face and for the first time, Harry saw"
13038,her foolish smile falter.
13039,"“Are you all right, dear?”"
13040,"“Oh yes,” said Voldemort quietly. “Yes, I’m very well. . . .”"
13041,"“I thought — but a trick of the light, I suppose —” said Hepzi-"
13042,"bah, looking unnerved, and Harry guessed that she too had seen"
13043,"the momentary red gleam in Voldemort’s eyes. “Here, Hokey, take"
13044,these away and lock them up again. . . . The usual enchant-
13045,ments . . .”
13046,"“Time to leave, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly, and as the lit-"
13047,"tle elf bobbed away bearing the boxes, Dumbledore grasped Harry"
13048,once again above the elbow and together they rose up through
13049,oblivion and back to Dumbledore’s office.
13050,"“Hepzibah Smith died two days after that little scene,” said"
13051,"Dumbledore, resuming his seat and indicating that Harry should"
13052,do the same. “Hokey the house-elf was convicted by the Ministry
13053,of poisoning her mistress’s evening cocoa by accident.”
13054,“No way!” said Harry angrily.
13055,"“I see we are of one mind,” said Dumbledore. “Certainly, there"
13056,are many similarities between this death and that of the Riddles. In
13057,"both cases, somebody else took the blame, someone who had a"
13058,clear memory of having caused the death —”
13059,“Hokey confessed?”
13060,“She remembered putting something in her mistress’s cocoa that
13061,"turned out not to be sugar, but a lethal and little-known poison,”"
13062,said Dumbledore. “It was concluded that she had not meant to do
13063,"it, but being old and confused —”"
13064, 438  
13065,LORD VOLDEMORT’S

13067,"“Voldemort modified her memory, just like he did with Morfin!”"
13068,"“Yes, that is my conclusion too,” said Dumbledore. “And, just as"
13069,"with Morfin, the Ministry was predisposed to suspect Hokey —”"
13070,"“— because she was a house-elf,” said Harry. He had rarely felt"
13071,"more in sympathy with the society Hermione had set up, S.P.E.W."
13072,"“Precisely,” said Dumbledore. “She was old, she admitted to"
13073,"having tampered with the drink, and nobody at the Ministry both-"
13074,"ered to inquire further. As in the case of Morfin, by the time I"
13075,"traced her and managed to extract this memory, her life was almost"
13076,"over — but her memory, of course, proves nothing except that"
13077,Voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket.
13078,"“By the time Hokey was convicted, Hepzibah’s family had real-"
13079,ized that two of her greatest treasures were missing. It took them a
13080,"while to be sure of this, for she had many hiding places, having al-"
13081,ways guarded her collection most jealously. But before they were
13082,"sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone, the"
13083,"assistant who had worked at Borgin and Burkes, the young man"
13084,"who had visited Hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well,"
13085,had resigned his post and vanished. His superiors had no idea
13086,where he had gone; they were as surprised as anyone at his disap-
13087,pearance. And that was the last that was seen or heard of Tom Rid-
13088,dle for a very long time.
13089,"“Now,” said Dumbledore, “if you don’t mind, Harry, I want to"
13090,pause once more to draw your attention to certain points of our
13091,story. Voldemort had committed another murder; whether it was
13092,"his first since he killed the Riddles, I do not know, but I think it"
13093,"was. This time, as you will have seen, he killed not for revenge, but"
13094,"for gain. He wanted the two fabulous trophies that poor, besotted,"
13095, 439   
13096,CHAPTER TWENTY
13097,old woman showed him. Just as he had once robbed the other chil-
13098,"dren at his orphanage, just as he had stolen his Uncle Morfin’s ring,"
13099,so he ran off now with Hepzibah’s cup and locket.”
13100,"“But,” said Harry, frowning, “it seems mad. . . . Risking every-"
13101,"thing, throwing away his job, just for those . . .”"
13102,"“Mad to you, perhaps, but not to Voldemort,” said Dumble-"
13103,dore. “I hope you will understand in due course exactly what those
13104,"objects meant to him, Harry, but you must admit that it is not dif-"
13105,"ficult to imagine that he saw the locket, at least, as rightfully his.”"
13106,"“The locket maybe,” said Harry, “but why take the cup as well?”"
13107,"“It had belonged to another of Hogwarts’s founders,” said Dum-"
13108,bledore. “I think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that
13109,he could not resist an object so steeped in Hogwarts history. There
13110,"were other reasons, I think. . . . I hope to be able to demonstrate"
13111,them to you in due course.
13112,"“And now for the very last recollection I have to show you, at least"
13113,until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn’s memory for us.
13114,"Ten years separates Hokey’s memory and this one, ten years during"
13115,which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing. . . .”
13116,Harry got to his feet once more as Dumbledore emptied the last
13117,memory into the Pensieve.
13118,“Whose memory is it?” he asked.
13119,"“Mine,” said Dumbledore."
13120,And Harry dived after Dumbledore through the shifting silver
13121,"mass, landing in the very office he had just left. There was Fawkes"
13122,"slumbering happily on his perch, and there behind the desk was"
13123,"Dumbledore, who looked very similar to the Dumbledore standing"
13124,"beside Harry, though both hands were whole and undamaged and"
13125,"his face was, perhaps, a little less lined. The one difference between"

13131,building up on the outside ledge.
13132,"The younger Dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something,"
13133,"and sure enough, moments after their arrival, there was a knock on"
13134,"the door and he said, “Enter.”"
13135,Harry let out a hastily stifled gasp. Voldemort had entered the
13136,room. His features were not those Harry had seen emerge from the
13137,great stone cauldron almost two years ago: They were not as snake-
13138,"like, the eyes were not yet scarlet, the face not yet masklike, and yet"
13139,he was no longer handsome Tom Riddle. It was as though his fea-
13140,tures had been burned and blurred; they were waxy and oddly dis-
13141,"torted, and the whites of the eyes now had a permanently bloody"
13142,"look, though the pupils were not yet the slits that Harry knew they"
13143,"would become. He was wearing a long black cloak, and his face was"
13144,as pale as the snow glistening on his shoulders.
13145,The Dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise.
13146,Evidently this visit had been made by appointment.
13147,"“Good evening, Tom,” said Dumbledore easily. “Won’t you sit"
13148,down?”
13149,"“Thank you,” said Voldemort, and he took the seat to which"
13150,"Dumbledore had gestured — the very seat, by the looks of it, that"
13151,Harry had just vacated in the present. “I heard that you had be-
13152,"come headmaster,” he said, and his voice was slightly higher and"
13153,colder than it had been. “A worthy choice.”
13154,"“I am glad you approve,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “May I of-"
13155,fer you a drink?”
13156,"“That would be welcome,” said Voldemort. “I have come a long"

13160,Dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now

13162,"handed Voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself, he"
13163,returned to the seat behind his desk.
13164,"“So, Tom . . . to what do I owe the pleasure?”"
13165,"Voldemort did not answer at once, but merely sipped his wine."
13166,"“They do not call me ‘Tom’ anymore,” he said. “These days, I"
13167,am known as —”
13168,"“I know what you are known as,” said Dumbledore, smiling"
13169,"pleasantly. “But to me, I’m afraid, you will always be Tom Riddle."
13170,It is one of the irritating things about old teachers. I am afraid that
13171,they never quite forget their charges’ youthful beginnings.”
13172,"He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face re-"
13173,"mained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in"
13174,the room change subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s
13175,chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms
13176,"of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as"
13177,such.
13178,"“I am surprised you have remained here so long,” said Volde-"
13179,mort after a short pause. “I always wondered why a wizard such as
13180,yourself never wished to leave school.”
13181,"“Well,” said Dumbledore, still smiling, “to a wizard such as my-"
13182,"self, there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient"
13183,"skills, helping hone young minds. If I remember correctly, you"
13184,once saw the attraction of teaching too.”
13185,"“I see it still,” said Voldemort. “I merely wondered why you —"
13186,"who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry, and who have"
13187,"twice, I think, been offered the post of Minister —”"

13191,"“Three times at the last count, actually,” said Dumbledore. “But"
13192,"the Ministry never attracted me as a career. Again, something we"
13193,"have in common, I think.”"
13194,"Voldemort inclined his head, unsmiling, and took another sip of"
13195,wine. Dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between
13196,"them now, but waited, with a look of pleasant expectancy, for"
13197,Voldemort to talk first.
13198,"“I have returned,” he said, after a little while, “later, perhaps,"
13199,"than Professor Dippet expected . . . but I have returned, neverthe-"
13200,"less, to request again what he once told me I was too young to have."
13201,I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this cas-
13202,"tle, to teach. I think you must know that I have seen and done"
13203,much since I left this place. I could show and tell your students
13204,things they can gain from no other wizard.”
13205,Dumbledore considered Voldemort over the top of his own gob-
13206,let for a while before speaking.
13207,"“Yes, I certainly do know that you have seen and done much"
13208,"since leaving us,” he said quietly. “Rumors of your doings have"
13209,"reached your old school, Tom. I should be sorry to believe half of"
13210,them.”
13211,"Voldemort’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Great-"
13212,"ness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You"
13213,"must know this, Dumbledore.”"
13214,"“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?”"
13215,asked Dumbledore delicately.
13216,"“Certainly,” said Voldemort, and his eyes seemed to burn red. “I"
13217,"have experimented; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further,"
13218,"perhaps, than they have ever been pushed —”"
13219, 443   

13221,"“Of some kinds of magic,” Dumbledore corrected him quietly."
13222,"“Of some. Of others, you remain . . . forgive me . . . woefully"
13223,ignorant.”
13224,"For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil"
13225,"thing, more threatening than a look of rage."
13226,"“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in"
13227,the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is
13228,"more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.”"
13229,"“Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places,” suggested"
13230,Dumbledore.
13231,"“Well, then, what better place to start my fresh researches than"
13232,"here, at Hogwarts?” said Voldemort. “Will you let me return? Will"
13233,you let me share my knowledge with your students? I place myself
13234,and my talents at your disposal. I am yours to command.”
13235,Dumbledore raised his eyebrows. “And what will become of
13236,those whom you command? What will happen to those who call
13237,themselves — or so rumor has it — the Death Eaters?”
13238,Harry could tell that Voldemort had not expected Dumbledore
13239,to know this name; he saw Voldemort’s eyes flash red again and the
13240,slitlike nostrils flare.
13241,"“My friends,” he said, after a moment’s pause, “will carry on"
13242,"without me, I am sure.”"
13243,"“I am glad to hear that you consider them friends,” said Dum-"
13244,bledore. “I was under the impression that they are more in the or-
13245,der of servants.”
13246,"“You are mistaken,” said Voldemort."
13247,"“Then if I were to go to the Hog’s Head tonight, I would not find"
13248,"a group of them — Nott, Rosier, Mulciber, Dolohov — awaiting"
13249,"your return? Devoted friends indeed, to travel this far with you on"

13253,"a snowy night, merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure"
13254,a teaching post.”
13255,There could be no doubt that Dumbledore’s detailed knowledge
13256,of those with whom he was traveling was even less welcome to
13257,"Voldemort; however, he rallied almost at once."
13258,"“You are omniscient as ever, Dumbledore.”"
13259,"“Oh no, merely friendly with the local barmen,” said Dumble-"
13260,"dore lightly. “Now, Tom . . .”"
13261,Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in
13262,"his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic"
13263,gesture.
13264,"“Let us speak openly. Why have you come here tonight, sur-"
13265,"rounded by henchmen, to request a job we both know you do not"
13266,want?”
13267,Voldemort looked coldly surprised. “A job I do not want? On
13268,"the contrary, Dumbledore, I want it very much.”"
13269,"“Oh, you want to come back to Hogwarts, but you do not want"
13270,to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen.
13271,"What is it you’re after, Tom? Why not try an open request for once?”"
13272,Voldemort sneered. “If you do not want to give me a job —”
13273,"“Of course I don’t,” said Dumbledore. “And I don’t think for a"
13274,"moment you expected me to. Nevertheless, you came here, you"
13275,"asked, you must have had a purpose.”"
13276,"Voldemort stood up. He looked less like Tom Riddle than ever,"
13277,his features thick with rage. “This is your final word?”
13278,"“It is,” said Dumbledore, also standing."
13279,“Then we have nothing more to say to each other.”
13280,"“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his"
13281,face. “The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a

13283,CHAPTER TWENTY
13284,burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your
13285,"crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. . . . I wish I could. . . .”"
13286,"For a second, Harry was on the verge of shouting a pointless"
13287,warning: He was sure that Voldemort’s hand had twitched toward
13288,"his pocket and his wand; but then the moment had passed, Volde-"
13289,"mort had turned away, the door was closing, and he was gone."
13290,Harry felt Dumbledore’s hand close over his arm again and mo-
13291,"ments later, they were standing together on almost the same spot,"
13292,"but there was no snow building on the window ledge, and Dum-"
13293,bledore’s hand was blackened and dead-looking once more.
13294,"“Why?” said Harry at once, looking up into Dumbledore’s face."
13295,“Why did he come back? Did you ever find out?”
13296,"“I have ideas,” said Dumbledore, “but no more than that.”"
13297,"“What ideas, sir?”"
13298,"“I shall tell you, Harry, when you have retrieved that memory"
13299,"from Professor Slughorn,” said Dumbledore. “When you have that"
13300,"last piece of the jigsaw, everything will, I hope, be clear . . . to both"
13301,of us.”
13302,Harry was still burning with curiosity and even though Dum-
13303,"bledore had walked to the door and was holding it open for him,"
13304,he did not move at once.
13305,"“Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again, sir?"
13306,He didn’t say. . . .”
13307,"“Oh, he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts"
13308,"job,” said Dumbledore. “The aftermath of our little meeting"
13309,"proved that. You see, we have never been able to keep a Defense"
13310,Against the Dark Arts teacher for longer than a year since I refused
13311,the post to Lord Voldemort.”

13315,H          arry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he
13316,was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true mem-
13317,"ory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was"
13318,reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a
13319,"loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would"
13320,"have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so"
13321,many times before.
13322,"“You won’t find anything in there,” said Hermione firmly, late"
13323,on Sunday evening.
13324,"“Don’t start, Hermione,” said Harry. “If it hadn’t been for the"
13325,"Prince, Ron wouldn’t be sitting here now.”"
13326,"“He would if you’d just listened to Snape in our first year,” said"
13327,Hermione dismissively.
13328,Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation (“Sectum-
13329,sempra!”) scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words “For
13330,  447  
13331,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13332,"Enemies,” and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to"
13333,"in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the"
13334,corner of the page.
13335,They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only
13336,other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a cer-
13337,tain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from
13338,dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the
13339,date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on
13340,"or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option"
13341,"of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take"
13342,place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.
13343,Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not man-
13344,aged to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test.
13345,"Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little"
13346,"more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for an-"
13347,"other four months, could not take the test whether ready or not."
13348,"“At least you can Apparate, though!” said Ron tensely. “You’ll"
13349,have no trouble come July!”
13350,"“I’ve only done it once,” Harry reminded him; he had finally"
13351,managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during
13352,their previous lesson.
13353,"Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition,"
13354,Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for
13355,Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry
13356,"fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed"
13357,"with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not"
13358,care: Slughorn’s memory was the most important thing to him now.
13359,"“I’m telling you, the stupid Prince isn’t going to be able to help"
13360,"you with this, Harry!” said Hermione, more loudly. “There’s only"
13361, 448  
13362,THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
13363,"one way to force someone to do what you want, and that’s the Im-"
13364,"perius Curse, which is illegal —”"
13365,"“Yeah, I know that, thanks,” said Harry, not looking up from the"
13366,book. “That’s why I’m looking for something different. Dumble-
13367,"dore says Veritaserum won’t do it, but there might be something"
13368,"else, a potion or a spell. . . .”"
13369,"“You’re going about it the wrong way,” said Hermione. “Only"
13370,"you can get the memory, Dumbledore says. That must mean you"
13371,can persuade Slughorn where other people can’t. It’s not a question
13372,"of slipping him a potion, anyone could do that —”"
13373,"“How d’you spell ‘belligerent’?” said Ron, shaking his quill very"
13374,hard while staring at his parchment. “It can’t be B — U — M —”
13375,"“No, it isn’t,” said Hermione, pulling Ron’s essay toward her."
13376,“And ‘augury’ doesn’t begin O — R — G either. What kind of
13377,quill are you using?”
13378,“It’s one of Fred and George’s Spell-Check ones . . . but I think
13379,the charm must be wearing off. . . .”
13380,"“Yes, it must,” said Hermione, pointing at the title of his essay,"
13381,"“because we were asked how we’d deal with dementors, not ‘Dug-"
13382,"bogs,’ and I don’t remember you changing your name to ‘Roonil"
13383,Wazlib’ either.”
13384,"“Ah no!” said Ron, staring horror-struck at the parchment."
13385,“Don’t say I’ll have to write the whole thing out again!”
13386,"“It’s okay, we can fix it,” said Hermione, pulling the essay toward"
13387,her and taking out her wand.
13388,"“I love you, Hermione,” said Ron, sinking back in his chair, rub-"
13389,bing his eyes wearily.
13390,"Hermione turned faintly pink, but merely said, “Don’t let"
13391,Lavender hear you saying that.”

13394,"“I won’t,” said Ron into his hands. “Or maybe I will . . . then"
13395,she’ll ditch me . . .”
13396,“Why don’t you ditch her if you want to finish it?” asked Harry.
13397,"“You haven’t ever chucked anyone, have you?” said Ron. “You"
13398,and Cho just —”
13399,"“Sort of fell apart, yeah,” said Harry"
13400,"“Wish that would happen with me and Lavender,” said Ron"
13401,"gloomily, watching Hermione silently tapping each of his mis-"
13402,"spelled words with the end of her wand, so that they corrected"
13403,"themselves on the page. “But the more I hint I want to finish it, the"
13404,tighter she holds on. It’s like going out with the giant squid.”
13405,"“There,” said Hermione, some twenty minutes later, handing"
13406,back Ron’s essay.
13407,"“Thanks a million,” said Ron. “Can I borrow your quill for the"
13408,conclusion?”
13409,"Harry, who had found nothing useful in the Half-Blood Prince’s"
13410,"notes so far, looked around; the three of them were now the only"
13411,"ones left in the common room, Seamus having just gone up to bed"
13412,cursing Snape and his essay. The only sounds were the crackling of
13413,the fire and Ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors
13414,using Hermione’s quill. Harry had just closed the Half-Blood
13415,"Prince’s book, yawning, when —"
13416,Crack.
13417,Hermione let out a little shriek; Ron spilled ink all over his
13418,"freshly completed essay, and Harry said, “Kreacher!”"
13419,The house-elf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toes.

13426,"“Dobby has been helping too, Harry Potter!” he squeaked, cast-"
13427,ing Kreacher a resentful look. “And Kreacher ought to tell Dobby
13428,when he is coming to see Harry Potter so they can make their re-
13429,ports together!”
13430,"“What is this?” asked Hermione, still looking shocked by these"
13431,"sudden appearances. “What’s going on, Harry?”"
13432,"Harry hesitated before answering, because he had not told Her-"
13433,mione about setting Kreacher and Dobby to tail Malfoy; house-
13434,elves were always such a touchy subject with her.
13435,"“Well . . . they’ve been following Malfoy for me,” he said."
13436,"“Night and day,” croaked Kreacher."
13437,"“Dobby has not slept for a week, Harry Potter!” said Dobby"
13438,"proudly, swaying where he stood."
13439,Hermione looked indignant.
13440,"“You haven’t slept, Dobby? But surely, Harry, you didn’t tell him"
13441,not to —”
13442,"“No, of course I didn’t,” said Harry quickly. “Dobby, you can"
13443,"sleep, all right? But has either of you found out anything?” he has-"
13444,"tened to ask, before Hermione could intervene again."
13445,“Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure
13446,"blood,” croaked Kreacher at once. “His features recall the fine"
13447,bones of my mistress and his manners are those of —”
13448,“Draco Malfoy is a bad boy!” squeaked Dobby angrily. “A bad

13450,He shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toes of his

13454,"Harry, to whom this was not entirely unexpected, caught him"
13455,around the middle and held him fast. For a few seconds Dobby
13456,"struggled, then went limp."
13457,"“Thank you, Harry Potter,” he panted. “Dobby still finds it dif-"
13458,ficult to speak ill of his old masters. . . .”
13459,Harry released him; Dobby straightened his tea cozy and said
13460,"defiantly to Kreacher, “But Kreacher should know that Draco Mal-"
13461,foy is not a good master to a house-elf!”
13462,"“Yeah, we don’t need to hear about you being in love with"
13463,"Malfoy,” Harry told Kreacher. “Let’s fast forward to where he’s"
13464,actually been going.”

13471,"ing in the firelight, “the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that"
13472,"Dobby can discover, but he is still keen to avoid detection. He has"
13473,been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of
13474,"other students, who keep watch for him while he enters —”"
13475,"“The Room of Requirement!” said Harry, smacking himself"
13476,hard on the forehead with Advanced Potion-Making. Hermione and
13477,Ron stared at him. “That’s where he’s been sneaking off to! That’s
13478,where he’s doing . . . whatever he’s doing! And I bet that’s why he’s

13487,"“Dobby, have you managed to get in to have a look at what Mal-"

13489,"“No, Harry Potter, that is impossible,” said Dobby."
13490,"“No, it’s not,” said Harry at once. “Malfoy got into our head-"
13491,"quarters there last year, so I’ll be able to get in and spy on him, no"
13492,problem.”
13493,"“But I don’t think you will, Harry,” said Hermione slowly. “Mal-"
13494,"foy already knew exactly how we were using the room, didn’t he,"
13495,because that stupid Marietta had blabbed. He needed the room to
13496,"become the headquarters of the D.A., so it did. But you don’t know"
13497,"what the room becomes when Malfoy goes in there, so you don’t"
13498,know what to ask it to transform into.”
13499,"“There’ll be a way around that,” said Harry dismissively. “You’ve"

13501,"“Kreacher’s done well too,” said Hermione kindly; but far from"
13502,"looking grateful, Kreacher averted his huge, bloodshot eyes and"
13503,"croaked at the ceiling, “The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher,"
13504,Kreacher will pretend he cannot hear —”
13505,"“Get out of it,” Harry snapped at him, and Kreacher made one"

13510,"“How good’s this?” said Harry enthusiastically, turning to Ron"
13511,and Hermione the moment the room was elf-free again. “We know

13518,the ink off with her wand.
13519,“But what’s all this about him going up there with a ‘variety of

13526,Harry’s voice tailed away; he was staring at the fire.

13535,and starting to pace in front of the fire. “They’re stupid enough to
13536,do what they’re told even if he won’t tell them what he’s up to . . .
13537,but he doesn’t want them to be seen lurking around outside the
13538,"Room of Requirement, so he’s got them taking Polyjuice to make"
13539,them look like other people. . . . Those two girls I saw him with
13540,when he missed Quidditch — ha! Crabbe and Goyle!”
13541,"“Do you mean to say,” said Hermione in a hushed voice, “that"
13542,that little girl whose scales I repaired — ?”
13543,"“Yeah, of course!” said Harry loudly, staring at her. “Of course!"
13544,"Malfoy must’ve been inside the room at the time, so she — what"
13545,  454    
13546,THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
13547,am I talking about? — he dropped the scales to tell Malfoy not to
13548,"come out, because there was someone there! And there was that girl"
13549,who dropped the toadspawn too! We’ve been walking past him all
13550,the time and not realizing it!”
13551,“He’s got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls?” guffawed
13552,Ron. “Blimey . . . No wonder they don’t look too happy these days.
13553,. . . I’m surprised they don’t tell him to stuff it. . . .”
13554,"“Well, they wouldn’t, would they, if he’s shown them his Dark"
13555,Mark?” said Harry.
13556,"“Hmmm . . . the Dark Mark we don’t know exists,” said Hermi-"
13557,"one skeptically, rolling up Ron’s dried essay before it could come to"
13558,any more harm and handing it to him.
13559,"“We’ll see,” said Harry confidently."
13560,"“Yes, we will,” Hermione said, getting to her feet and stretching."
13561,"“But, Harry, before you get all excited, I still don’t think you’ll be"
13562,able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what’s
13563,there first. And I don’t think you should forget” — she heaved her
13564,bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look — “that
13565,what you’re supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory
13566,from Slughorn. Good night.”
13567,"Harry watched her go, feeling slightly disgruntled. Once the"
13568,door to the girls’ dormitories had closed behind her he rounded on
13569,Ron.
13570,“What d’you think?”
13571,"“Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf,” said Ron, staring at"
13572,the spot where Dobby had vanished. “I’d have that Apparition Test
13573,in the bag.”
13574,Harry did not sleep well that night. He lay awake for what felt like
13575,"hours, wondering how Malfoy was using the Room of Requirement"
13576,  455  
13577,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13578,"and what he, Harry, would see when he went in there the following"
13579,"day, for whatever Hermione said, Harry was sure that if Malfoy had"
13580,"been able to see the headquarters of the D.A., he would be able to see"
13581,Malfoy’s . . . what could it be? A meeting place? A hideout? A store-
13582,"room? A workshop? Harry’s mind worked feverishly and his dreams,"
13583,"when he finally fell asleep, were broken and disturbed by images of"
13584,"Malfoy, who turned into Slughorn, who turned into Snape. . . ."
13585,Harry was in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the fol-
13586,lowing morning; he had a free period before Defense Against the
13587,Dark Arts and was determined to spend it trying to get into the
13588,Room of Requirement. Hermione was rather ostentatiously show-
13589,ing no interest in his whispered plans for forcing entry into the
13590,"room, which irritated Harry, because he thought she might be a lot"
13591,of help if she wanted to.
13592,"“Look,” he said quietly, leaning forward and putting a hand"
13593,"on the Daily Prophet, which she had just removed from a post owl,"
13594,to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it. “I haven’t for-
13595,"gotten about Slughorn, but I haven’t got a clue how to get that"
13596,"memory off him, and until I get a brain wave why shouldn’t I find"
13597,out what Malfoy’s doing?”
13598,"“I’ve already told you, you need to persuade Slughorn,” said Her-"
13599,"mione. “It’s not a question of tricking him or bewitching him, or"
13600,Dumbledore could have done it in a second. Instead of messing
13601,around outside the Room of Requirement” — she jerked the
13602,Prophet out from under Harry’s hand and unfolded it to look at the
13603,front page — “you should go and find Slughorn and start appeal-
13604,ing to his better nature.”
13605,"“Anyone we know — ?” asked Ron, as Hermione scanned the"
13606,headlines.
13607, 456   
13608,THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
13609,"“Yes!” said Hermione, causing both Harry and Ron to gag on"
13610,"their breakfast. “But it’s all right, he’s not dead — it’s Mundungus,"
13611,he’s been arrested and sent to Azkaban! Something to do with
13612,impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary . . . and
13613,"someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished. . . . Oh, and how"
13614,"horrible, a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his"
13615,"grandparents, they think he was under the Imperius Curse. . . .”"
13616,They finished their breakfast in silence. Hermione set off imme-
13617,"diately for Ancient Runes; Ron for the common room, where he"
13618,still had to finish his conclusion on Snape’s dementor essay; and
13619,Harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall
13620,opposite the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy teaching trolls to do
13621,ballet.
13622,Harry slipped on his Invisibility Cloak once he had found an
13623,"empty passage, but he need not have bothered. When he reached"
13624,his destination he found it deserted. Harry was not sure whether
13625,his chances of getting inside the room were better with Malfoy in-
13626,"side it or out, but at least his first attempt was not going to be com-"
13627,plicated by the presence of Crabbe or Goyle pretending to be an
13628,eleven-year-old girl.
13629,He closed his eyes as he approached the place where the Room
13630,of Requirement’s door was concealed. He knew what he had to do;
13631,he had become most accomplished at it last year. Concentrating
13632,"with all his might he thought, I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in"
13633,here. . . . I need to see what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . . I need to see
13634,what Malfoy’s doing in here. . . .
13635,"Three times he walked past the door; then, his heart pounding"
13636,"with excitement, he opened his eyes and faced it —"
13637,But he was still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall.
13638,  457    
13639,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13640,He moved forward and gave it an experimental push. The stone
13641,remained solid and unyielding.
13642,"“Okay,” said Harry aloud. “Okay . . . I thought the wrong"
13643,thing. . . .”
13644,"He pondered for a moment then set off again, eyes closed, con-"
13645,centrating as hard as he could.
13646,I need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . . I
13647,need to see the place where Malfoy keeps coming secretly. . . .
13648,"After three walks past, he opened his eyes expectantly."
13649,There was no door.
13650,"“Oh, come off it,” he told the wall irritably. “That was a clear in-"
13651,struction. . . . Fine . . .”
13652,He thought hard for several minutes before striding off once
13653,more.
13654,I need you to become the place you become for Draco Malfoy. . . .
13655,He did not immediately open his eyes when he had finished his
13656,"patrolling; he was listening hard, as though he might hear the door"
13657,"pop into existence. He heard nothing, however, except the distant"
13658,twittering of birds outside. He opened his eyes.
13659,There was still no door.
13660,Harry swore. Someone screamed. He looked around to see a
13661,"gaggle of first years running back around the corner, apparently un-"
13662,der the impression that they had just encountered a particularly
13663,foulmouthed ghost.
13664,Harry tried every variation of “I need to see what Draco Malfoy
13665,"is doing inside you” that he could think of for a whole hour, at the"
13666,end of which he was forced to concede that Hermione might have
13667,had a point: The room simply did not want to open for him. Frus-
13668,"trated and annoyed, he set off for Defense Against the Dark Arts,"

13671,pulling off his Invisibility Cloak and stuffing it into his bag as he
13672,went.
13673,"“Late again, Potter,” said Snape coldly, as Harry hurried into the"
13674,candlelit classroom. “Ten points from Gryffindor.”
13675,Harry scowled at Snape as he flung himself into the seat beside
13676,"Ron; half the class was still on its feet, taking out books and orga-"
13677,nizing their things; he could not be much later than any of them.
13678,"“Before we start, I want your dementor essays,” said Snape, wav-"
13679,"ing his wand carelessly, so that twenty-five scrolls of parchment"
13680,soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk. “And I
13681,hope for your sakes they are better than the tripe I had to endure
13682,"on resisting the Imperius Curse. Now, if you will all open your"
13683,"books to page — what is it, Mr. Finnigan?”"
13684,"“Sir,” said Seamus, “I’ve been wondering, how do you tell the"
13685,difference between an Inferius and a ghost? Because there was
13686,something in the paper about an Inferius —”
13687,"“No, there wasn’t,” said Snape in a bored voice."
13688,"“But sir, I heard people talking —”"
13689,"“If you had actually read the article in question, Mr. Finnigan,"
13690,you would have known that the so-called Inferius was nothing but
13691,a smelly sneak thief by the name of Mundungus Fletcher.”
13692,"“I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side,” mut-"
13693,tered Harry to Ron and Hermione. “Shouldn’t he be upset Mun-
13694,dungus has been arrest —”
13695,"“But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject,” said"
13696,"Snape, pointing suddenly at the back of the room, his black eyes"
13697,fixed on Harry “Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference
13698,between an Inferius and a ghost.”
13699,"The whole class looked around at Harry, who hastily tried to"
13700, 459   
13701,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13702,recall what Dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone
13703,to visit Slughorn.
13704,“Er — well — ghosts are transparent —” he said.
13705,"“Oh, very good,” interrupted Snape, his lip curling. “Yes, it is"
13706,easy to see that nearly six years of magical education have not been
13707,"wasted on you, Potter. ‘Ghosts are transparent.’ ”"
13708,Pansy Parkinson let out a high-pitched giggle. Several other peo-
13709,"ple were smirking. Harry took a deep breath and continued calmly,"
13710,"though his insides were boiling, “Yeah, ghosts are transparent, but"
13711,"Inferi are dead bodies, aren’t they? So they’d be solid —”"
13712,"“A five-year-old could have told us as much,” sneered Snape."
13713,“The Inferius is a corpse that has been reanimated by a Dark wiz-
13714,"ard’s spells. It is not alive, it is merely used like a puppet to do the"
13715,"wizard’s bidding. A ghost, as I trust that you are all aware by now,"
13716,is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth . . . and of
13717,"course, as Potter so wisely tells us, transparent.”"
13718,"“Well, what Harry said is the most useful if we’re trying to"
13719,tell them apart!” said Ron. “When we come face-to-face with one
13720,"down a dark alley, we’re going to be having a shufti to see if it’s"
13721,"solid, aren’t we, we’re not going to be asking, ‘Excuse me, are you"
13722,the imprint of a departed soul?’ ”
13723,"There was a ripple of laughter, instantly quelled by the look"
13724,Snape gave the class.
13725,"“Another ten points from Gryffindor,” said Snape. “I would ex-"
13726,"pect nothing more sophisticated from you, Ronald Weasley, the"
13727,boy so solid he cannot Apparate half an inch across a room.”
13728,"“No!” whispered Hermione, grabbing Harry’s arm as he opened"
13729,"his mouth furiously. “There’s no point, you’ll just end up in deten-"
13730,"tion again, leave it!”"
13731,  460  
13732,THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
13733,"“Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen,” said"
13734,"Snape, smirking a little, “and read the first two paragraphs on the"
13735,Cruciatus Curse. . . .”
13736,Ron was very subdued all through the class. When the bell
13737,"sounded at the end of the lesson, Lavender caught up with Ron"
13738,and Harry (Hermione mysteriously melted out of sight as she ap-
13739,proached) and abused Snape hotly for his jibe about Ron’s Appari-
13740,"tion, but this seemed to merely irritate Ron, and he shook her off by"
13741,making a detour into the boys’ bathroom with Harry.
13742,"“Snape’s right, though, isn’t he?” said Ron, after staring into a"
13743,cracked mirror for a minute or two. “I dunno whether it’s worth
13744,me taking the test. I just can’t get the hang of Apparition.”
13745,“You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade
13746,"and see where they get you,” said Harry reasonably. “It’ll be more"
13747,"interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway. Then, if"
13748,"you’re still not — you know — as good as you’d like to be, you can"
13749,"postpone the test, do it with me over the summ — Myrtle, this is"
13750,the boys’ bathroom!”
13751,The ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind
13752,"them and was now floating in midair, staring at them through"
13753,"thick, white, round glasses."
13754,"“Oh,” she said glumly. “It’s you two.”"
13755,"“Who were you expecting?” said Ron, looking at her in the"
13756,mirror.
13757,"“Nobody,” said Myrtle, picking moodily at a spot on her chin."
13758,"“He said he’d come back and see me, but then you said you’d pop"
13759,in and visit me too” — she gave Harry a reproachful look — “and
13760,I haven’t seen you for months and months. I’ve learned not to ex-
13761,pect too much from boys.”
13762, 461   
13763,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13764,"“I thought you lived in that girls’ bathroom?” said Harry, who"
13765,had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some years now.
13766,"“I do,” she said, with a sulky little shrug, “but that doesn’t mean"
13767,"I can’t visit other places. I came and saw you in your bath once,"
13768,remember?”
13769,"“Vividly,” said Harry."
13770,"“But I thought he liked me,” she said plaintively. “Maybe if you"
13771,"two left, he’d come back again. . . . We had lots in common. . . ."
13772,I’m sure he felt it. . . .”
13773,And she looked hopefully toward the door.
13774,"“When you say you had lots in common,” said Ron, sounding"
13775,"rather amused now, “d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too?”"
13776,"“No,” said Myrtle defiantly, her voice echoing loudly around the"
13777,"old tiled bathroom. “I mean he’s sensitive, people bully him too,"
13778,"and he feels lonely and hasn’t got anybody to talk to, and he’s not"
13779,afraid to show his feelings and cry!”
13780,“There’s been a boy in here crying?” said Harry curiously. “A
13781,young boy?”
13782,"“Never you mind!” said Myrtle, her small, leaky eyes fixed on"
13783,"Ron, who was now definitely grinning. “I promised I wouldn’t tell"
13784,"anyone, and I’ll take his secret to the —”"
13785,"“— not the grave, surely?” said Ron with a snort. “The sewers,"
13786,maybe . . .”
13787,"Myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet, caus-"
13788,ing water to slop over the sides and onto the floor. Goading Myrtle
13789,seemed to have put fresh heart into Ron.
13790,"“You’re right,” he said, swinging his schoolbag back over his"
13791,"shoulder, “I’ll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I de-"
13792,cide about taking the test.”
13793, 462    
13794,THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
13795,"And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the"
13796,rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the
13797,test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get
13798,"ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it"
13799,"was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they"
13800,"had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time"
13801,to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.
13802,"“You’d do better,” said Hermione, when he confided this plan to"
13803,"Ron and her in the entrance hall, “to go straight to Slughorn’s of-"
13804,fice and try and get that memory from him.”
13805,"“I’ve been trying!” said Harry crossly, which was perfectly true."
13806,He had lagged behind after every Potions lesson that week in an at-
13807,"tempt to corner Slughorn, but the Potions master always left the"
13808,"dungeon so fast that Harry had not been able to catch him. Twice,"
13809,"Harry had gone to his office and knocked, but received no reply,"
13810,though on the second occasion he was sure he had heard the
13811,quickly stifled sounds of an old gramophone.
13812,"“He doesn’t want to talk to me, Hermione! He can tell I’ve been"
13813,"trying to get him on his own again, and he’s not going to let it hap-"
13814,pen!”
13815,"“Well, you’ve just got to keep at it, haven’t you?”"
13816,"The short queue of people waiting to file past Filch, who was do-"
13817,"ing his usual prodding act with the Secrecy Sensor, moved forward"
13818,a few steps and Harry did not answer in case he was overheard by the
13819,"caretaker. He wished Ron and Hermione both luck, then turned"
13820,"and climbed the marble staircase again, determined, whatever Her-"
13821,"mione said, to devote an hour or two to the Room of Requirement."
13822,"Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Ma-"
13823,rauder’s Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having
13824,  463  
13825,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13826,"concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, “I solemnly"
13827,"swear that I am up to no good,” and scanned it carefully."
13828,"As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside"
13829,"their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the"
13830,"Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the"
13831,Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a
13832,stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. . . .
13833,"There were a few people out in the grounds . . . and there, alone in"
13834,"the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign"
13835,"of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about"
13836,"that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open,"
13837,whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up
13838,"the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the"
13839,"corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same"
13840,"little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so"
13841,kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right be-
13842,"hind her before bending very low and whispering, “Hello . . ."
13843,"you’re very pretty, aren’t you?”"
13844,"Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up"
13845,"into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the"
13846,sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corri-
13847,"dor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind"
13848,"which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware"
13849,"that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an"
13850,appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he
13851,tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.
13852,"Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, hav-"
13853,ing tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy
13854,"was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated"
13855, 464  
13856,THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM
13857,"beyond belief; Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there"
13858,was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in
13859,"there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and"
13860,kicked it.
13861,“OUCH!”
13862,He thought he might have broken his toe; as he clutched it and
13863,"hopped on one foot, the Invisibility Cloak slipped off him."
13864,“Harry?”
13865,"He spun around, one-legged, and toppled over. There, to his ut-"
13866,"ter astonishment, was Tonks, walking toward him as though she"
13867,frequently strolled up this corridor.
13868,"“What’re you doing here?” he said, scrambling to his feet again;"
13869,why did she always have to find him lying on the floor?
13870,"“I came to see Dumbledore,” said Tonks."
13871,"Harry thought she looked terrible: thinner than usual, her"
13872,mouse-colored hair lank.
13873,"“His office isn’t here,” said Harry, “it’s round the other side of"
13874,"the castle, behind the gargoyle —”"
13875,"“I know,” said Tonks. “He’s not there. Apparently he’s gone away"
13876,again.”
13877,"“Has he?” said Harry, putting his bruised foot gingerly back on"
13878,"the floor. “Hey — you don’t know where he goes, I suppose?”"
13879,"“No,” said Tonks."
13880,“What did you want to see him about?”
13881,"“Nothing in particular,” said Tonks, picking, apparently uncon-"
13882,"sciously, at the sleeve of her robe. “I just thought he might know"
13883,what’s going on. . . . I’ve heard rumors . . . people getting hurt . . .”
13884,"“Yeah, I know, it’s all been in the papers,” said Harry. “That lit-"

13887,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
13888,"“The Prophet’s often behind the times,” said Tonks, who didn’t"
13889,seem to be listening to him. “You haven’t had any letters from any-
13890,one in the Order recently?”
13891,"“No one from the Order writes to me anymore,” said Harry,"
13892,“not since Sirius —”
13893,He saw that her eyes had filled with tears.
13894,"“I’m sorry,” he muttered awkwardly. “I mean . . . I miss him, as"
13895,well. . . .”
13896,"“What?” said Tonks blankly, as though she had not heard him."
13897,"“Well . . . I’ll see you around, Harry . . .”"
13898,"And she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor,"
13899,"leaving Harry to stare after her. After a minute or so, he pulled the"
13900,Invisibility Cloak on again and resumed his efforts to get into the
13901,"Room of Requirement, but his heart was not in it. Finally, a hollow"
13902,feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that Ron and Hermione
13903,would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and
13904,"leave the corridor to Malfoy who, hopefully, would be too afraid to"
13905,leave for some hours to come.
13906,"He found Ron and Hermione in the Great Hall, already halfway"
13907,through an early lunch.
13908,"“I did it — well, kind of!” Ron told Harry enthusiastically when"
13909,he caught sight of him. “I was supposed to be Apparating to out-
13910,"side Madam Puddifoot’s Tea Shop and I overshot it a bit, ended up"
13911,"near Scrivenshaft’s, but at least I moved!”"
13912,"“Good one,” said Harry. “How’d you do, Hermione?”"
13913,"“Oh, she was perfect, obviously,” said Ron, before Hermione"
13914,"could answer. “Perfect deliberation, divination, and desperation or"
13915,whatever the hell it is — we all went for a quick drink in the Three
13916,Broomsticks after and you should’ve heard Twycross going on

13919,about her — I’ll be surprised if he doesn’t pop the question
13920,soon —”
13921,"“And what about you?” asked Hermione, ignoring Ron. “Have"
13922,you been up at the Room of Requirement all this time?”
13923,"“Yep,” said Harry. “And guess who I ran into up there? Tonks!”"
13924,"“Tonks?” repeated Ron and Hermione together, looking"
13925,surprised.
13926,"“Yeah, she said she’d come to visit Dumbledore. . . .”"
13927,"“If you ask me,” said Ron once Harry had finished describing his"
13928,"conversation with Tonks, “she’s cracking up a bit. Losing her nerve"
13929,after what happened at the Ministry.”
13930,"“It’s a bit odd,” said Hermione, who for some reason looked very"
13931,"concerned. “She’s supposed to be guarding the school, why’s she"
13932,suddenly abandoning her post to come and see Dumbledore when
13933,he’s not even here?”
13934,"“I had a thought,” said Harry tentatively. He felt strange about"
13935,voicing it; this was much more Hermione’s territory than his. “You
13936,don’t think she can have been . . . you know . . . in love with Sirius?”
13937,Hermione stared at him.
13938,“What on earth makes you say that?”
13939,"“I dunno,” said Harry, shrugging, “but she was nearly crying"
13940,when I mentioned his name . . . and her Patronus is a big four-
13941,legged thing now. . . . I wondered whether it hadn’t become . . .
13942,you know . . . him.”
13943,"“It’s a thought,” said Hermione slowly. “But I still don’t know"
13944,"why she’d be bursting into the castle to see Dumbledore, if that’s re-"
13945,ally why she was here. . . .”
13946,"“Goes back to what I said, doesn’t it?” said Ron, who was now"
13947,shoveling mashed potato into his mouth. “She’s gone a bit funny.

13950,"Lost her nerve. Women,” he said wisely to Harry, “they’re easily"
13951,upset.”
13952,"“And yet,” said Hermione, coming out of her reverie, “I doubt"
13953,you’d find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam
13954,"Rosmerta didn’t laugh at their joke about the hag, the Healer, and"

13960,P       atches of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the
13961,"castle turrets, but these signs of approaching summer did not"
13962,"lift Harry’s mood. He had been thwarted, both in his attempts to"
13963,"find out what Malfoy was doing, and in his efforts to start a conver-"
13964,"sation with Slughorn that might lead, somehow, to Slughorn hand-"
13965,ing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decades.
13966,"“For the last time, just forget about Malfoy,” Hermione told"
13967,Harry firmly.
13968,They were sitting with Ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard
13969,after lunch. Hermione and Ron were both clutching a Ministry of
13970,Magic leaflet — Common Apparition Mistakes and How to Avoid
13971,"Them — for they were taking their tests that very afternoon, but by"
13972,and large the leaflets had not proved soothing to the nerves.
13973,Ron gave a start and tried to hide behind Hermione as a girl
13974,came around the corner.
13975,"“It isn’t Lavender,” said Hermione wearily."
13976,  469  
13977,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
13978,"“Oh, good,” said Ron, relaxing."
13979,“Harry Potter?” said the girl. “I was asked to give you this.”
13980,“Thanks . . .”
13981,Harry’s heart sank as he took the small scroll of parchment.
13982,"Once the girl was out of earshot he said, “Dumbledore said we"
13983,wouldn’t be having any more lessons until I got the memory!”
13984,“Maybe he wants to check on how you’re doing?” suggested
13985,"Hermione, as Harry unrolled the parchment; but rather than find-"
13986,"ing Dumbledore’s long, narrow, slanted writing he saw an untidy"
13987,"sprawl, very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotches"
13988,on the parchment where the ink had run.
13989,"Dear Harry, Ron, and Hermione,"
13990,"Aragog died last night. Harry and Ron, you met him,"
13991,"and you know how special he was. Hermione, I know"
13992,you’d have liked him. It would mean a lot to me if
13993,you’d nip down for the burial later this evening. I’m
13994,"planning on doing it round dusk, that was his favorite"
13995,time of day. I know you’re not supposed to be out that
13996,"late, but you can use the cloak. Wouldn’t ask, but I"
13997,can’t face it alone.

13999,"“Look at this,” said Harry, handing the note to Hermione."
14000,"“Oh, for heaven’s sake,” she said, scanning it quickly and passing"
14001,"it to Ron, who read it through looking increasingly incredulous."
14002,“He’s mental !” he said furiously. “That thing told its mates to eat

14004,AFTER THE BURIAL
14005,Harry and me! Told them to help themselves! And now Hagrid ex-
14006,pects us to go down there and cry over its horrible hairy body!”
14007,"“It’s not just that,” said Hermione. “He’s asking us to leave the"
14008,castle at night and he knows security’s a million times tighter and
14009,how much trouble we’d be in if we were caught.”
14010,"“We’ve been down to see him by night before,” said Harry."
14011,"“Yes, but for something like this?” said Hermione. “We’ve risked"
14012,"a lot to help Hagrid out, but after all — Aragog’s dead. If it were a"
14013,question of saving him —”
14014,"“— I’d want to go even less,” said Ron firmly. “You didn’t meet"
14015,"him, Hermione. Believe me, being dead will have improved him a"
14016,lot.”
14017,Harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky
14018,blotches all over it. Tears had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the
14019,parchment. . . .
14020,"“Harry, you can’t be thinking of going,” said Hermione. “It’s"
14021,such a pointless thing to get detention for.”
14022,"Harry sighed. “Yeah, I know,” he said. “I s’pose Hagrid’ll have to"
14023,bury Aragog without us.”
14024,"“Yes, he will,” said Hermione, looking relieved. “Look, Potions"
14025,"will be almost empty this afternoon, with us all off doing our tests."
14026,. . . Try and soften Slughorn up a bit then!”
14027,"“Fifty-seventh time lucky, you think?” said Harry bitterly."
14028,"“Lucky,” said Ron suddenly. “Harry, that’s it — get lucky!”"
14029,“What d’you mean?”
14030,“Use your lucky potion!”
14031,"“Ron, that’s — that’s it!” said Hermione, sounding stunned. “Of"
14032,course! Why didn’t I think of it?”
14033, 471  
14034,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14035,Harry stared at them both. “Felix Felicis?” he said. “I dunno . . .
14036,I was sort of saving it. . . .”
14037,“What for?” demanded Ron incredulously.
14038,"“What on earth is more important than this memory, Harry?”"
14039,asked Hermione.
14040,Harry did not answer. The thought of that little golden bottle
14041,had hovered on the edges of his imagination for some time; vague
14042,and unformulated plans that involved Ginny splitting up with
14043,"Dean, and Ron somehow being happy to see her with a new"
14044,"boyfriend, had been fermenting in the depths of his brain, unac-"
14045,knowledged except during dreams or the twilight time between
14046,sleeping and waking. . . .
14047,“Harry? Are you still with us?” asked Hermione.
14048,"“Wha — ? Yeah, of course,” he said, pulling himself together."
14049,"“Well . . . okay. If I can’t get Slughorn to talk this afternoon, I’ll"
14050,take some Felix and have another go this evening.”
14051,"“That’s decided, then,” said Hermione briskly, getting to her feet"
14052,and performing a graceful pirouette. “Destination . . . determina-
14053,tion . . . deliberation . . .” she murmured.
14054,"“Oh, stop that,” Ron begged her, “I feel sick enough as it is —"
14055,"quick, hide me!”"
14056,"“It isn’t Lavender!” said Hermione impatiently, as another cou-"
14057,ple of girls appeared in the courtyard and Ron dived behind her.
14058,"“Cool,” said Ron, peering over Hermione’s shoulder to check."
14059,"“Blimey, they don’t look happy, do they?”"
14060,“They’re the Montgomery sisters and of course they don’t look
14061,"happy, didn’t you hear what happened to their little brother?” said"
14062,Hermione.
14063, 472 
14064,AFTER THE BURIAL
14065,"“I’m losing track of what’s happening to everyone’s relatives, to"
14066,"be honest,” said Ron."
14067,"“Well, their brother was attacked by a werewolf. The rumor is"
14068,"that their mother refused to help the Death Eaters. Anyway, the boy"
14069,"was only five and he died in St. Mungo’s, they couldn’t save him.”"
14070,"“He died?” repeated Harry, shocked. “But surely werewolves"
14071,"don’t kill, they just turn you into one of them?”"
14072,"“They sometimes kill,” said Ron, who looked unusually grave"
14073,now. “I’ve heard of it happening when the werewolf gets carried
14074,away.”
14075,“What was the werewolf ’s name?” said Harry quickly.
14076,"“Well, the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback,” said"
14077,Hermione.
14078,"“I knew it — the maniac who likes attacking kids, the one"
14079,Lupin told me about!” said Harry angrily.
14080,Hermione looked at him bleakly.
14081,"“Harry, you’ve got to get that memory,” she said. “It’s all about"
14082,"stopping Voldemort, isn’t it? These dreadful things that are hap-"
14083,pening are all down to him. . . .”
14084,The bell rang overhead in the castle and both Hermione and
14085,"Ron jumped to their feet, looking terrified."
14086,"“You’ll do fine,” Harry told them both, as they headed toward"
14087,the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their Ap-
14088,parition Test. “Good luck.”
14089,"“And you too!” said Hermione with a significant look, as Harry"
14090,headed off to the dungeons.
14091,"There were only three of them in Potions that afternoon: Harry,"
14092,"Ernie, and Draco Malfoy."
14093, 473  
14094,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14095,“All too young to Apparate just yet?” said Slughorn genially.
14096,“Not turned seventeen yet?”
14097,They shook their heads.
14098,"“Ah well,” said Slughorn cheerily, “as we’re so few, we’ll do some-"
14099,thing fun. I want you all to brew me up something amusing!”
14100,"“That sounds good, sir,” said Ernie sycophantically, rubbing his"
14101,"hands together. Malfoy, on the other hand, did not crack a smile."
14102,"“What do you mean, ‘something amusing’?” he said irritably."
14103,"“Oh, surprise me,” said Slughorn airily."
14104,Malfoy opened his copy of Advanced Potion-Making with a sulky
14105,expression. It could not have been plainer that he thought this les-
14106,"son was a waste of time. Undoubtedly, Harry thought, watching"
14107,"him over the top of his own book, Malfoy was begrudging the time"
14108,he could otherwise be spending in the Room of Requirement.
14109,"Was it his imagination, or did Malfoy, like Tonks, look thinner?"
14110,"Certainly he looked paler; his skin still had that grayish tinge,"
14111,probably because he so rarely saw daylight these days. But there was
14112,"no air of smugness, excitement, or superiority; none of the swagger"
14113,"that he had had on the Hogwarts Express, when he had boasted"
14114,openly of the mission he had been given by Voldemort. . . . There
14115,"could be only one conclusion, in Harry’s opinion: The mission,"
14116,"whatever it was, was going badly."
14117,"Cheered by this thought, Harry skimmed through his copy of"
14118,Advanced Potion-Making and found a heavily corrected Half-Blood
14119,"Prince’s version of “An Elixir to Induce Euphoria,” which seemed"
14120,"not only to meet Slughorn’s instructions, but which might (Harry’s"
14121,heart leapt as the thought struck him) put Slughorn into such a
14122,good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory
14123,if Harry could persuade him to taste some. . . .
14124, 474   
14125,AFTER THE BURIAL
14126,"“Well, now, this looks absolutely wonderful,” said Slughorn an"
14127,"hour and a half later, clapping his hands together as he stared down"
14128,"into the sunshine yellow contents of Harry’s cauldron. “Euphoria, I"
14129,take it? And what’s that I smell? Mmmm . . . you’ve added just a sprig
14130,"of peppermint, haven’t you? Unorthodox, but what a stroke of inspi-"
14131,"ration, Harry, of course, that would tend to counterbalance the occa-"
14132,sional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking. . . . I really
14133,"don’t know where you get these brain waves, my boy . . . unless —”"
14134,Harry pushed the Half-Blood Prince’s book deeper into his bag
14135,with his foot.
14136,“— it’s just your mother’s genes coming out in you!”
14137,"“Oh . . . yeah, maybe,” said Harry, relieved."
14138,Ernie was looking rather grumpy; determined to outshine Harry
14139,"for once, he had most rashly invented his own potion, which had"
14140,curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his
14141,"cauldron. Malfoy was already packing up, sour-faced; Slughorn"
14142,had pronounced his Hiccuping Solution merely “passable.”
14143,The bell rang and both Ernie and Malfoy left at once.
14144,"“Sir,” Harry began, but Slughorn immediately glanced over his"
14145,shoulder; when he saw that the room was empty but for himself
14146,"and Harry, he hurried away as fast as he could."
14147,"“Professor — Professor, don’t you want to taste my po — ?”"
14148,called Harry desperately.
14149,"But Slughorn had gone. Disappointed, Harry emptied the caul-"

14151,back upstairs to the common room.
14152,Ron and Hermione returned in the late afternoon.
14153,“Harry!” cried Hermione as she climbed through the portrait
14154,"hole. “Harry, I passed!”"
14155, 475   
14156,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14157,“Well done!” he said. “And Ron?”
14158,"“He — he just failed,” whispered Hermione, as Ron came"
14159,slouching into the room looking most morose. “It was really un-
14160,"lucky, a tiny thing, the examiner just spotted that he’d left half an"
14161,eyebrow behind. . . . How did it go with Slughorn?”
14162,"“No joy,” said Harry, as Ron joined them. “Bad luck, mate, but"
14163,you’ll pass next time — we can take it together.”
14164,"“Yeah, I s’pose,” said Ron grumpily. “But half an eyebrow! Like"
14165,that matters!”
14166,"“I know,” said Hermione soothingly, “it does seem really"
14167,harsh. . . .”
14168,They spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the Apparition
14169,"examiner, and Ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time"
14170,"they set off back to the common room, now discussing the contin-"
14171,uing problem of Slughorn and the memory.
14172,"“So, Harry — you going to use the Felix Felicis or what?” Ron"
14173,demanded.
14174,"“Yeah, I s’pose I’d better,” said Harry. “I don’t reckon I’ll need all"
14175,"of it, not twelve hours’ worth, it can’t take all night. . . . I’ll just"
14176,take a mouthful. Two or three hours should do it.”
14177,"“It’s a great feeling when you take it,” said Ron reminiscently."
14178,“Like you can’t do anything wrong.”
14179,"“What are you talking about?” said Hermione, laughing. “You’ve"
14180,never taken any!”
14181,"“Yeah, but I thought I had, didn’t I?” said Ron, as though ex-"
14182,plaining the obvious. “Same difference really . . .”
14183,As they had only just seen Slughorn enter the Great Hall and
14184,"knew that he liked to take time over meals, they lingered for a while"
14185,"in the common room, the plan being that Harry should go to"

14188,Slughorn’s office once the teacher had had time to get back there.
14189,When the sun had sunk to the level of the treetops in the Forbid-

14192,"common room, sneaked up to the boys’ dormitory."
14193,Harry took out the rolled-up socks at the bottom of his trunk
14194,"and extracted the tiny, gleaming bottle."
14195,"“Well, here goes,” said Harry, and he raised the little bottle and"
14196,took a carefully measured gulp.
14197,“What does it feel like?” whispered Hermione.
14198,"Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an"
14199,exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt
14200,"as though he could have done anything, anything at all . . . and"
14201,getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only pos-
14202,"sible, but positively easy. . . ."
14203,"He got to his feet, smiling, brimming with confidence."
14204,"“Excellent,” he said. “Really excellent. Right . . . I’m going"
14205,down to Hagrid’s.”
14206,"“What?” said Ron and Hermione together, looking aghast."
14207,"“No, Harry — you’ve got to go and see Slughorn, remember?”"
14208,said Hermione.
14209,"“No,” said Harry confidently. “I’m going to Hagrid’s, I’ve got a"
14210,good feeling about going to Hagrid’s.”
14211,“You’ve got a good feeling about burying a giant spider?” asked
14212,"Ron, looking stunned."
14213,"“Yeah,” said Harry, pulling his Invisibility Cloak out of his bag."
14214,"“I feel like it’s the place to be tonight, you know what I mean?”"
14215,"“No,” said Ron and Hermione together, both looking positively"
14216,alarmed now.

14219,"“This is Felix Felicis, I suppose?” said Hermione anxiously, hold-"
14220,ing up the bottle to the light. “You haven’t got another little bottle
14221,full of— I don’t know —”
14222,"“Essence of Insanity?” suggested Ron, as Harry swung his cloak"
14223,over his shoulders.
14224,"Harry laughed, and Ron and Hermione looked even more"
14225,alarmed.
14226,"“Trust me,” he said. “I know what I’m doing . . . or at least” —"
14227,he strolled confidently to the door — “Felix does.”
14228,He pulled the Invisibility Cloak over his head and set off down
14229,"the stairs, Ron and Hermione hurrying along behind him. At the"
14230,"foot of the stairs, Harry slid through the open door."
14231,“What were you doing up there with her?” shrieked Lavender
14232,"Brown, staring right through Harry at Ron and Hermione emerg-"
14233,ing together from the boys’ dormitories. Harry heard Ron splutter-
14234,ing behind him as he darted across the room away from them.
14235,Getting through the portrait hole was simple; as he approached
14236,"it, Ginny and Dean came through it, and Harry was able to slip be-"
14237,"tween them. As he did so, he brushed accidentally against Ginny."
14238,"“Don’t push me, please, Dean,” she said, sounding annoyed."
14239,"“You’re always doing that, I can get through perfectly well on my"
14240,own. . . .”
14241,"The portrait swung closed behind Harry, but not before he had"
14242,heard Dean make an angry retort. . . . His feeling of elation in-
14243,"creasing, Harry strode off through the castle. He did not have to"
14244,"creep along, for he met nobody on his way, but this did not surprise"
14245,"him in the slightest: This evening, he was the luckiest person at"
14246,Hogwarts.
14247,"Why he knew that going to Hagrid’s was the right thing to do,"
14248, 478   
14249,AFTER THE BURIAL
14250,he had no idea. It was as though the potion was illuminating a few
14251,"steps of the path at a time: He could not see the final destination,"
14252,"he could not see where Slughorn came in, but he knew that he was"
14253,going the right way to get that memory. When he reached the en-
14254,trance hall he saw that Filch had forgotten to lock the front door.
14255,"Beaming, Harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean"
14256,air and grass for a moment before walking down the steps into the
14257,dusk.
14258,It was when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him
14259,how very pleasant it would be to pass the vegetable patch on his
14260,"walk to Hagrid’s. It was not strictly on the way, but it seemed clear"
14261,"to Harry that this was a whim on which he should act, so he di-"
14262,"rected his feet immediately toward the vegetable patch, where he"
14263,"was pleased, but not altogether surprised, to find Professor"
14264,Slughorn in conversation with Professor Sprout. Harry lurked be-
14265,"hind a low stone wall, feeling at peace with the world and listening"
14266,to their conversation.
14267,"“I do thank you for taking the time, Pomona,” Slughorn was"
14268,"saying courteously, “most authorities agree that they are at their"
14269,most efficacious if picked at twilight.”
14270,"“Oh, I quite agree,” said Professor Sprout warmly. “That enough"
14271,for you?”
14272,"“Plenty, plenty,” said Slughorn, who, Harry saw, was carrying an"
14273,armful of leafy plants. “This should allow for a few leaves for each
14274,"of my third years, and some to spare if anybody over-stews them."
14275,". . . Well, good evening to you, and many thanks again!”"
14276,Professor Sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the
14277,"direction of her greenhouses, and Slughorn directed his steps to the"
14278,"spot where Harry stood, invisible."

14280,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14281,"Seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself, Harry pulled"
14282,off the cloak with a flourish.
14283,"“Good evening, Professor.”"
14284,"“Merlin’s beard, Harry, you made me jump,” said Slughorn,"
14285,stopping dead in his tracks and looking wary. “How did you get
14286,out of the castle?”
14287,"“I think Filch must’ve forgotten to lock the doors,” said Harry"
14288,"cheerfully, and was delighted to see Slughorn scowl."
14289,"“I’ll be reporting that man, he’s more concerned about litter"
14290,"than proper security if you ask me. . . . But why are you out here,"
14291,Harry?”
14292,"“Well, sir, it’s Hagrid,” said Harry, who knew that the right"
14293,thing to do just now was to tell the truth. “He’s pretty upset. . . .
14294,"But you won’t tell anyone, Professor? I don’t want trouble for"
14295,him. . . .”
14296,"Slughorn’s curiosity was evidently aroused. “Well, I can’t promise"
14297,"that,” he said gruffly. “But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid"
14298,"to the hilt, so I’m sure he can’t be up to anything very dreadful. . . .”"
14299,"“Well, it’s this giant spider, he’s had it for years. . . . It lived in"
14300,the forest. . . . It could talk and everything —”
14301,"“I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest,” said"
14302,"Slughorn softly, looking over at the mass of black trees. “It’s true,"
14303,then?”
14304,"“Yes,” said Harry. “But this one, Aragog, the first one Hagrid"
14305,"ever got, it died last night. He’s devastated. He wants company"
14306,while he buries it and I said I’d go.”
14307,"“Touching, touching,” said Slughorn absentmindedly, his large"
14308,droopy eyes fixed upon the distant lights of Hagrid’s cabin. “But
14309, 480   
14310,AFTER THE BURIAL
14311,acromantula venom is very valuable . . . If the beast only just died
14312,"it might not yet have dried out. . . . Of course, I wouldn’t want to"
14313,do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset . . . but if there was any
14314,"way to procure some . . . I mean, it’s almost impossible to get"
14315,venom from an acromantula while it’s alive. . . .”
14316,Slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than Harry now.
14317,“. . . seems an awful waste not to collect it . . . might get a hun-
14318,"dred Galleons a pint. . . . To be frank, my salary is not large. . . .”"
14319,And now Harry saw clearly what was to be done.
14320,"“Well,” he said, with a most convincing hesitancy, “well, if you"
14321,"wanted to come, Professor, Hagrid would probably be really"
14322,"pleased. . . . Give Aragog a better send-off, you know . . .”"
14323,"“Yes, of course,” said Slughorn, his eyes now gleaming with en-"
14324,"thusiasm. “I tell you what, Harry, I’ll meet you down there with a"
14325,bottle or two. . . . We’ll drink the poor beast’s — well — not
14326,"health — but we’ll send it off in style, anyway, once it’s buried."
14327,"And I’ll change my tie, this one is a little exuberant for the occa-"
14328,sion. . . .”
14329,"He bustled back into the castle, and Harry sped off to Hagrid’s,"
14330,delighted with himself.
14331,"“Yeh came,” croaked Hagrid, when he opened the door and saw"
14332,Harry emerging from the Invisibility Cloak in front of him.
14333,"“Yeah — Ron and Hermione couldn’t, though,” said Harry."
14334,“They’re really sorry.”
14335,"“Don’ — don’ matter . . . He’d’ve bin touched yeh’re here,"
14336,"though, Harry. . . .”"
14337,Hagrid gave a great sob. He had made himself a black armband
14338,"out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish, and his eyes"
14339, 481   
14340,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14341,"were puffy, red, and swollen. Harry patted him consolingly on the"
14342,"elbow, which was the highest point of Hagrid he could easily reach."
14343,“Where are we burying him?” he asked. “The forest?”
14344,"“Blimey, no,” said Hagrid, wiping his streaming eyes on the bot-"
14345,tom of his shirt. “The other spiders won’ let me anywhere near
14346,their webs now Aragog’s gone. Turns out it was on’y on his orders
14347,"they didn’ eat me! Can yeh believe that, Harry?”"
14348,The honest answer was “yes”; Harry recalled with painful ease
14349,the scene when he and Ron had come face-to-face with the acro-
14350,mantulas: They had been quite clear that Aragog was the only
14351,thing that stopped them from eating Hagrid.
14352,"“Never bin an area o’ the forest I couldn’ go before!” said Hagrid,"
14353,"shaking his head. “It wasn’ easy, gettin’ Aragog’s body out o’ there,"
14354,"I can tell yeh — they usually eat their dead, see. . . . But I wanted"
14355,ter give ’im a nice burial . . . a proper send-off . . .”
14356,He broke into sobs again and Harry resumed the patting of his
14357,"elbow, saying as he did so (for the potion seemed to indicate that it"
14358,"was the right thing to do), “Professor Slughorn met me coming"
14359,"down here, Hagrid.”"
14360,"“Not in trouble, are yeh?” said Hagrid, looking up, alarmed."
14361,"“Yeh shouldn’ be outta the castle in the evenin’, I know it, it’s my"
14362,fault —”
14363,"“No, no, when he heard what I was doing he said he’d like to"
14364,"come and pay his last respects to Aragog too,” said Harry. “He’s"
14365,"gone to change into something more suitable, I think . . . and he"
14366,said he’d bring some bottles so we can drink to Aragog’s mem-
14367,ory. . . .
14368,"“Did he?” said Hagrid, looking both astonished and touched."
14369,  482 
14370,AFTER THE BURIAL
14371,"“Tha’s — tha’s righ’ nice of him, that is, an’ not turnin’ yeh in ei-"
14372,ther. I’ve never really had a lot ter do with Horace Slughorn before.
14373,". . . Comin’ ter see old Aragog off, though, eh? Well . . . he’d’ve"
14374,"liked that, Aragog would. . . .”"
14375,Harry thought privately that what Aragog would have liked
14376,most about Slughorn was the ample amount of edible flesh he pro-
14377,"vided, but he merely moved to the rear window of Hagrid’s hut,"
14378,where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider
14379,"lying on its back outside, its legs curled and tangled."
14380,"“Are we going to bury him here, Hagrid, in your garden?”"
14381,"“Jus’ beyond the pumpkin patch, I thought,” said Hagrid in a"
14382,choked voice. “I’ve already dug the — yeh know — grave. Jus’
14383,"thought we’d say a few nice things over him — happy memories,"
14384,yeh know —”
14385,"His voice quivered and broke. There was a knock on the door,"
14386,"and he turned to answer it, blowing his nose on his great spotted"
14387,"handkerchief as he did so. Slughorn hurried over the threshold,"
14388,"several bottles in his arms, and wearing a somber black cravat."
14389,"“Hagrid,” he said, in a deep, grave voice. “So very sorry to hear"
14390,of your loss.”
14391,"“Tha’s very nice of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Thanks a lot. An’ thanks"
14392,fer not givin’ Harry detention neither. . . .”
14393,"“Wouldn’t have dreamed of it,” said Slughorn. “Sad night, sad"
14394,night . . . Where is the poor creature?”
14395,"“Out here,” said Hagrid in a shaking voice. “Shall we — shall"
14396,"we do it, then?”"
14397,The three of them stepped out into the back garden. The moon
14398,"was glistening palely through the trees now, and its rays mingled"
14399, 483   
14400,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14401,with the light spilling from Hagrid’s window to illuminate Aragog’s
14402,body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a ten-foot-high
14403,mound of freshly dug earth.
14404,"“Magnificent,” said Slughorn, approaching the spider’s head,"
14405,"where eight milky eyes stared blankly at the sky and two huge,"
14406,"curved pincers shone, motionless, in the moonlight. Harry thought"
14407,"he heard the tinkle of bottles as Slughorn bent over the pincers, ap-"
14408,parently examining the enormous hairy head.
14409,"“It’s not ev’ryone appreciates how beau’iful they are,” said Ha-"
14410,"grid to Slughorn’s back, tears leaking from the corners of his"
14411,crinkled eyes. “I didn’ know yeh were int’rested in creatures like
14412,"Aragog, Horace.”"
14413,"“Interested? My dear Hagrid, I revere them,” said Slughorn,"
14414,stepping back from the body. Harry saw the glint of a bottle disap-
14415,"pear beneath his cloak, though Hagrid, mopping his eyes once"
14416,"more, noticed nothing. “Now . . . shall we proceed to the burial?”"
14417,Hagrid nodded and moved forward. He heaved the gigantic spi-
14418,"der into his arms and, with an enormous grunt, rolled it into the"
14419,"dark pit. It hit the bottom with a rather horrible, crunchy thud."
14420,Hagrid started to cry again.
14421,"“Of course, it’s difficult for you, who knew him best,” said"
14422,"Slughorn, who like Harry could reach no higher than Hagrid’s el-"
14423,"bow, but patted it all the same. “Why don’t I say a few words?”"
14424,"He must have got a lot of good quality venom from Aragog,"
14425,"Harry thought, for Slughorn wore a satisfied smirk as he stepped up"
14426,"to the rim of the pit and said, in a slow, impressive voice, “Farewell,"
14427,"Aragog, king of arachnids, whose long and faithful friendship those"
14428,"who knew you won’t forget! Though your body will decay, your"
14429, 484    
14430,AFTER THE BURIAL
14431,"spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home."
14432,May your many-eyed descendants ever flourish and your human
14433,friends find solace for the loss they have sustained.”
14434,"“Tha’ was . . . tha’ was . . . beau’iful!” howled Hagrid, and he"
14435,"collapsed onto the compost heap, crying harder than ever."
14436,"“There, there,” said Slughorn, waving his wand so that the huge"
14437,"pile of earth rose up and then fell, with a muffled sort of crash,"
14438,"onto the dead spider, forming a smooth mound. “Let’s get inside"
14439,"and have a drink. Get on his other side, Harry. . . . That’s it. . . ."
14440,"Up you come, Hagrid . . . Well done . . .”"
14441,"They deposited Hagrid in a chair at the table. Fang, who had"
14442,"been skulking in his basket during the burial, now came padding"
14443,softly across to them and put his heavy head into Harry’s lap as
14444,usual. Slughorn uncorked one of the bottles of wine he had
14445,brought.
14446,"“I have had it all tested for poison,” he assured Harry, pouring"
14447,most of the first bottle into one of Hagrid’s bucket-sized mugs and
14448,handing it to Hagrid. “Had a house-elf taste every bottle after what
14449,happened to your poor friend Rupert.”
14450,"Harry saw, in his mind’s eye, the expression on Hermione’s face"
14451,"if she ever heard about this abuse of house-elves, and decided never"
14452,to mention it to her.
14453,"“One for Harry . . .” said Slughorn, dividing a second bottle be-"
14454,"tween two mugs, “. . . and one for me. Well” — he raised his mug"
14455,high — “to Aragog.”
14456,"“Aragog,” said Harry and Hagrid together."
14457,"Both Slughorn and Hagrid drank deeply. Harry, however, with"
14458,"the way ahead illuminated for him by Felix Felicis, knew that he"
14459,  485  
14460,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14461,"must not drink, so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set"
14462,the mug back on the table before him.
14463,"“I had him from an egg, yeh know,” said Hagrid morosely. “Tiny"
14464,little thing he was when he hatched. ’Bout the size of a Pekingese.”
14465,"“Sweet,” said Slughorn."
14466,“Used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until . . .
14467,well . . .”
14468,Hagrid’s face darkened and Harry knew why: Tom Riddle had
14469,"contrived to have Hagrid thrown out of school, blamed for open-"
14470,"ing the Chamber of Secrets. Slughorn, however, did not seem to be"
14471,"listening; he was looking up at the ceiling, from which a number of"
14472,"brass pots hung, and also a long, silky skein of bright white hair."
14473,"“That’s never unicorn hair, Hagrid?”"
14474,"“Oh, yeah,” said Hagrid indifferently. “Gets pulled out of their"
14475,"tails, they catch it on branches an’ stuff in the forest, yeh know . . .”"
14476,"“But my dear chap, do you know how much that’s worth?”"
14477,“I use it fer bindin’ on bandages an’ stuff if a creature gets in-
14478,"jured,” said Hagrid, shrugging. “It’s dead useful . . . very strong,"
14479,see.”
14480,"Slughorn took another deep draught from his mug, his eyes"
14481,"moving carefully around the cabin now, looking, Harry knew, for"
14482,more treasures that he might be able to convert into a plentiful sup-
14483,"ply of oak-matured mead, crystalized pineapple, and velvet smok-"
14484,"ing jackets. He refilled Hagrid’s mug and his own, and questioned"
14485,him about the creatures that lived in the forest these days and how
14486,"Hagrid was able to look after them all. Hagrid, becoming expan-"
14487,sive under the influence of the drink and Slughorn’s flattering in-
14488,"terest, stopped mopping his eyes and entered happily into a long"
14489,explanation of bowtruckle husbandry.
14490, 486    
14491,AFTER THE BURIAL
14492,"The Felix Felicis gave Harry a little nudge at this point, and he"
14493,noticed that the supply of drink that Slughorn had brought was
14494,running out fast. Harry had not yet managed to bring off the Re-
14495,"filling Charm without saying the incantation aloud, but the idea"
14496,"that he might not be able to do it tonight was laughable: Indeed,"
14497,"Harry grinned to himself as, unnoticed by either Hagrid or Slug-"
14498,horn (now swapping tales of the illegal trade in dragon eggs) he
14499,pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottles and they
14500,immediately began to refill.
14501,"After an hour or so, Hagrid and Slughorn began making extrav-"
14502,"agant toasts: to Hogwarts, to Dumbledore, to elf-made wine, and"
14503,to —
14504,"“Harry Potter!” bellowed Hagrid, slopping some of his four-"
14505,teenth bucket of wine down his chin as he drained it.
14506,"“Yes, indeed,” cried Slughorn a little thickly, “Parry Otter, the"
14507,"Chosen Boy Who — well — something of that sort,” he mum-"
14508,"bled, and drained his mug too."
14509,"Not long after this, Hagrid became tearful again and pressed the"
14510,"whole unicorn tail upon Slughorn, who pocketed it with cries of,"
14511,“To friendship! To generosity! To ten Galleons a hair!”
14512,"And for a while after that, Hagrid and Slughorn were sitting side"
14513,"by side, arms around each other, singing a slow sad song about a"
14514,dying wizard called Odo.
14515,"“Aaargh, the good die young,” muttered Hagrid, slumping low"
14516,"onto the table, a little cross-eyed, while Slughorn continued to war-"
14517,ble the refrain. “Me dad was no age ter go . . . nor were yer mum
14518,"an’ dad, Harry. . .”"
14519,Great fat tears oozed out of the corners of Hagrid’s crinkled eyes
14520,again; he grasped Harry’s arm and shook it.
14521, 487  
14522,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14523,“Bes’ wiz and witchard o’ their age I never knew . . . terrible

14525,"And Odo the hero, they bore him back home"
14526,"To the place that he’d known as a lad,"
14527,sang Slughorn plaintively.
14528,They laid him to rest with his hat inside out
14529,"And his wand snapped in two, which was sad."
14530,"“. . . terrible,” Hagrid grunted, and his great shaggy head rolled"
14531,"sideways onto his arms and he fell asleep, snoring deeply."
14532,"“Sorry,” said Slughorn with a hiccup. “Can’t carry a tune to save"
14533,my life.”
14534,"“Hagrid wasn’t talking about your singing,” said Harry quietly."
14535,“He was talking about my mum and dad dying.”
14536,"“Oh,” said Slughorn, repressing a large belch. “Oh dear. Yes, that"
14537,was — was terrible indeed. Terrible . . . terrible . . .”
14538,"He looked quite at a loss for what to say, and resorted to refilling"
14539,their mugs.
14540,"“I don’t — don’t suppose you remember it, Harry?” he asked"
14541,awkwardly.
14542,"“No — well, I was only one when they died,” said Harry, his"
14543,eyes on the flame of the candle flickering in Hagrid’s heavy snores.
14544,“But I’ve found out pretty much what happened since. My dad died
14545,first. Did you know that?”
14546,"“I — I didn’t,” said Slughorn in a hushed voice."
14547,“Yeah . . . Voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his
14548,"body toward my mum,” said Harry."
14549, 488  

14551,"Slughorn gave a great shudder, but he did not seem able to tear"
14552,his horrified gaze away from Harry’s face.
14553,"“He told her to get out of the way,” said Harry remorselessly."
14554,“He told me she needn’t have died. He only wanted me. She could
14555,have run.”
14556,"“Oh dear,” breathed Slughorn. “She could have . . . she needn’t"
14557,. . . That’s awful. . . .”
14558,"“It is, isn’t it?” said Harry, in a voice barely more than a whisper."
14559,"“But she didn’t move. Dad was already dead, but she didn’t want"
14560,me to go too. She tried to plead with Voldemort . . . but he just
14561,laughed. . . .”
14562,"“That’s enough!” said Slughorn suddenly, raising a shaking"
14563,"hand. “Really, my dear boy, enough . . . I’m an old man . . . I don’t"
14564,need to hear . . . I don’t want to hear . . .”
14565,"“I forgot,” lied Harry, Felix Felicis leading him on. “You liked"
14566,"her, didn’t you?”"
14567,"“Liked her?” said Slughorn, his eyes brimming with tears once"
14568,more. “I don’t imagine anyone who met her wouldn’t have liked
14569,her. . . . Very brave . . . Very funny . . . It was the most horrible
14570,thing. . . .”
14571,"“But you won’t help her son,” said Harry. “She gave me her life,"
14572,but you won’t give me a memory.”
14573,Hagrid’s rumbling snores filled the cabin. Harry looked steadily
14574,into Slughorn’s tear-filled eyes. The Potions master seemed unable
14575,to look away.
14576,"“Don’t say that,” he whispered. “It isn’t a question . . . If it were"
14577,"to help you, of course . . . but no purpose can be served . . .”"
14578,"“It can,” said Harry clearly. “Dumbledore needs information. I"
14579,need information.”
14580,  489  
14581,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
14582,He knew he was safe: Felix was telling him that Slughorn would
14583,remember nothing of this in the morning. Looking Slughorn
14584,"straight in the eye, Harry leaned forward a little."
14585,“I am the Chosen One. I have to kill him. I need that memory.”
14586,Slughorn turned paler than ever; his shiny forehead gleamed
14587,with sweat.
14588,“You are the Chosen One?”
14589,"“Of course I am,” said Harry calmly."
14590,“But then . . . my dear boy . . . you’re asking a great deal . . .
14591,"you’re asking me, in fact, to aid you in your attempt to destroy —”"
14592,“You don’t want to get rid of the wizard who killed Lily Evans?”
14593,"“Harry, Harry, of course I do, but —”"
14594,“You’re scared he’ll find out you helped me?”
14595,Slughorn said nothing; he looked terrified.
14596,"“Be brave like my mother, Professor. . . .”"
14597,Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to
14598,his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown
14599,baby.
14600,“I am not proud . . .” he whispered through his fingers. “I am
14601,ashamed of what — of what that memory shows. . . . I think I may
14602,have done great damage that day. . . .”
14603,"“You’d cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory,”"
14604,said Harry. “It would be a very brave and noble thing to do.”
14605,Hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on. Slughorn and Harry
14606,"stared at each other over the guttering candle. There was a long,"
14607,"long silence, but Felix Felicis told Harry not to break it, to wait."
14608,"Then, very slowly, Slughorn put his hand in his pocket and"
14609,pulled out his wand. He put his other hand inside his cloak and
14610,"took out a small, empty bottle. Still looking into Harry’s eyes,"
14611,  490 
14612,AFTER THE BURIAL
14613,Slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew
14614,"it, so that a long, silver thread of memory came away too, clinging"
14615,to the wand tip. Longer and longer the memory stretched until it
14616,"broke and swung, silvery bright, from the wand. Slughorn lowered"
14617,"it into the bottle where it coiled, then spread, swirling like gas. He"
14618,corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across
14619,the table to Harry.
14620,"“Thank you very much, Professor.”"
14621,"“You’re a good boy,” said Professor Slughorn, tears trickling"

14629,H          arry could feel the Felix Felicis wearing off as he crept
14630,back into the castle. The front door had remained un-
14631,"locked for him, but on the third floor he met Peeves and only nar-"
14632,rowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his
14633,shortcuts. By the time he got up to the portrait of the Fat Lady and
14634,"pulled off his Invisibility Cloak, he was not surprised to find her in"
14635,a most unhelpful mood.
14636,“What sort of time do you call this?”
14637,“I’m really sorry — I had to go out for something important —”
14638,"“Well, the password changed at midnight, so you’ll just have to"
14639,"sleep in the corridor, won’t you?”"
14640,“You’re joking!” said Harry. “Why did it have to change at
14641,midnight?”
14642,"“That’s the way it is,” said the Fat Lady. “If you’re angry, go"
14643,"and take it up with the headmaster, he’s the one who’s tightened"
14644,security.”

14647,"“Fantastic,” said Harry bitterly, looking around at the hard floor."
14648,"“Really brilliant. Yeah, I would go and take it up with Dumbledore"
14649,"if he was here, because he’s the one who wanted me to —”"
14650,"“He is here,” said a voice behind Harry. “Professor Dumbledore"
14651,returned to the school an hour ago.”
14652,"Nearly Headless Nick was gliding toward Harry, his head wob-"
14653,bling as usual upon his ruff.
14654,"“I had it from the Bloody Baron, who saw him arrive,” said"
14655,"Nick. “He appeared, according to the Baron, to be in good spirits,"
14656,"though a little tired, of course.”"
14657,"“Where is he?” said Harry, his heart leaping."
14658,"“Oh, groaning and clanking up on the Astronomy Tower, it’s a"
14659,favorite pastime of his —”
14660,“Not the Bloody Baron — Dumbledore!”
14661,"“Oh — in his office,” said Nick. “I believe, from what the Baron"
14662,"said, that he had business to attend to before turning in —”"
14663,"“Yeah, he has,” said Harry, excitement blazing in his chest at the"
14664,prospect of telling Dumbledore he had secured the memory. He
14665,"wheeled about and sprinted off again, ignoring the Fat Lady who"
14666,was calling after him.
14667,"“Come back! All right, I lied! I was annoyed you woke me up!"
14668,The password’s still ‘tapeworm’!”
14669,But Harry was already hurtling back along the corridor and
14670,"within minutes, he was saying “toffee éclairs” to Dumbledore’s gar-"
14671,"goyle, which leapt aside, permitting Harry entrance onto the spiral"
14672,staircase.
14673,"“Enter,” said Dumbledore when Harry knocked. He sounded"
14674,exhausted.
14675,"Harry pushed open the door. There was Dumbledore’s office,"

14677,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14678,"looking the same as ever, but with black, star-strewn skies beyond"
14679,the windows.
14680,"“Good gracious, Harry,” said Dumbledore in surprise. “To what"
14681,do I owe this very late pleasure?”
14682,“Sir — I’ve got it. I’ve got the memory from Slughorn.”
14683,Harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to Dumble-
14684,"dore. For a moment or two, the headmaster looked stunned. Then"
14685,his face split in a wide smile.
14686,"“Harry, this is spectacular news! Very well done indeed! I knew"
14687,you could do it!”
14688,"All thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten, he"
14689,"hurried around his desk, took the bottle with Slughorn’s memory"
14690,"in his uninjured hand, and strode over to the cabinet where he kept"
14691,the Pensieve.
14692,"“And now,” said Dumbledore, placing the stone basin upon his"
14693,"desk and emptying the contents of the bottle into it. “Now, at last,"
14694,"we shall see. Harry, quickly . . .”"
14695,Harry bowed obediently over the Pensieve and felt his feet leave
14696,the office floor. . . . Once again he fell through darkness and
14697,landed in Horace Slughorn’s office many years before.
14698,"There was the much younger Slughorn, with his thick, shiny,"
14699,"straw-colored hair and his gingery-blond mustache, sitting again in"
14700,"the comfortable winged armchair in his office, his feet resting upon"
14701,"a velvet pouffe, a small glass of wine in one hand, the other rum-"
14702,maging in a box of crystalized pineapple. And there were the half-
14703,dozen teenage boys sitting around Slughorn with Tom Riddle in
14704,"the midst of them, Marvolo’s gold-and-black ring gleaming on his"
14705,finger.
14706, 494 
14707,HORCRUXES
14708,"Dumbledore landed beside Harry just as Riddle asked, “Sir, is it"
14709,true that Professor Merrythought is retiring?”
14710,"“Tom, Tom, if I knew I couldn’t tell you,” said Slughorn, wag-"
14711,"ging his finger reprovingly at Riddle, though winking at the same"
14712,"time. “I must say, I’d like to know where you get your information,"
14713,"boy, more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are.”"
14714,Riddle smiled; the other boys laughed and cast him admiring
14715,looks.
14716,"“What with your uncanny ability to know things you shouldn’t,"
14717,and your careful flattery of the people who matter — thank you for
14718,"the pineapple, by the way, you’re quite right, it is my favorite —”"
14719,Several of the boys tittered again.
14720,“— I confidently expect you to rise to Minister of Magic within
14721,"twenty years. Fifteen, if you keep sending me pineapple, I have ex-"
14722,cellent contacts at the Ministry.”
14723,Tom Riddle merely smiled as the others laughed again. Harry
14724,"noticed that he was by no means the eldest of the group of boys,"
14725,but that they all seemed to look to him as their leader.
14726,"“I don’t know that politics would suit me, sir,” he said when the"
14727,"laughter had died away. “I don’t have the right kind of background,"
14728,for one thing.”
14729,A couple of the boys around him smirked at each other. Harry
14730,"was sure they were enjoying a private joke, undoubtedly about"
14731,"what they knew, or suspected, regarding their gang leader’s famous"
14732,ancestor.
14733,"“Nonsense,” said Slughorn briskly, “couldn’t be plainer you"
14734,"come from decent Wizarding stock, abilities like yours. No, you’ll"
14735,"go far, Tom, I’ve never been wrong about a student yet.”"
14736, 495   
14737,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14738,The small golden clock standing upon Slughorn’s desk chimed
14739,eleven o’clock behind him and he looked around.
14740,"“Good gracious, is it that time already? You’d better get going,"
14741,"boys, or we’ll all be in trouble. Lestrange, I want your essay by to-"
14742,"morrow or it’s detention. Same goes for you, Avery.”"
14743,"One by one, the boys filed out of the room. Slughorn heaved"
14744,himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his
14745,desk. A movement behind him made him look around; Riddle was
14746,still standing there.
14747,"“Look sharp, Tom, you don’t want to be caught out of bed out"
14748,"of hours, and you a prefect . . .”"
14749,"“Sir, I wanted to ask you something.”"
14750,"“Ask away, then, m’boy, ask away. . . .”"
14751,"“Sir, I wondered what you know about . . . about Horcruxes?”"
14752,"Slughorn stared at him, his thick fingers absentmindedly caress-"
14753,ing the stem of his wine glass.
14754,"“Project for Defense Against the Dark Arts, is it?”"
14755,But Harry could tell that Slughorn knew perfectly well that this
14756,was not schoolwork.
14757,"“Not exactly, sir,” said Riddle. “I came across the term while"
14758,reading and I didn’t fully understand it.”
14759,“No . . . well . . . you’d be hard-pushed to find a book at Hog-
14760,"warts that’ll give you details on Horcruxes, Tom, that’s very Dark"
14761,"stuff, very Dark indeed,” said Slughorn."
14762,"“But you obviously know all about them, sir? I mean, a wizard"
14763,"like you — sorry, I mean, if you can’t tell me, obviously — I just"
14764,"knew if anyone could tell me, you could — so I just thought I’d"
14765,ask —”
14766,"It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual"
14767, 496  
14768,HORCRUXES
14769,"tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had"
14770,too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of re-
14771,luctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that
14772,"Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been"
14773,working toward this moment for weeks.
14774,"“Well,” said Slughorn, not looking at Riddle, but fiddling with"
14775,"the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple, “well, it can’t"
14776,"hurt to give you an overview, of course. Just so that you understand"
14777,the term. A Horcrux is the word used for an object in which a per-
14778,son has concealed part of their soul.”
14779,"“I don’t quite understand how that works, though, sir,” said"
14780,Riddle.
14781,"His voice was carefully controlled, but Harry could sense his"
14782,excitement.
14783,"“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide"
14784,"part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is"
14785,"attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains"
14786,"earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a"
14787,form . . .”
14788,Slughorn’s face crumpled and Harry found himself remember-
14789,ing words he had heard nearly two years before: “I was ripped from
14790,"my body, I was less than spirit, less than the meanest ghost . . . but still,"
14791,I was alive.”
14792,"“. . . few would want it, Tom, very few. Death would be pre-"
14793,ferable.”
14794,But Riddle’s hunger was now apparent; his expression was
14795,"greedy, he could no longer hide his longing."
14796,“How do you split your soul?”
14797,"“Well,” said Slughorn uncomfortably, “you must understand"
14798,  497   
14799,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14800,that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole. Splitting it is
14801,"an act of violation, it is against nature.”"
14802,“But how do you do it?”
14803,“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing
14804,murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creat-
14805,ing a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would
14806,encase the torn portion —”
14807,“Encase? But how — ?”
14808,"“There is a spell, do not ask me, I don’t know!” said Slughorn,"
14809,shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquitoes. “Do
14810,I look as though I have tried it — do I look like a killer?”
14811,"“No, sir, of course not,” said Riddle quickly. “I’m sorry . . . I"
14812,didn’t mean to offend . . .”
14813,"“Not at all, not at all, not offended,” said Slughorn gruffly. “It’s"
14814,natural to feel some curiosity about these things. . . . Wizards of
14815,a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of
14816,magic. . . .”
14817,"“Yes, sir,” said Riddle. “What I don’t understand, though — just"
14818,"out of curiosity — I mean, would one Horcrux be much use? Can"
14819,"you only split your soul once? Wouldn’t it be better, make you"
14820,"stronger, to have your soul in more pieces, I mean, for instance, isn’t"
14821,"seven the most powerfully magical number, wouldn’t seven — ?”"
14822,"“Merlin’s beard, Tom!” yelped Slughorn. “Seven! Isn’t it bad"
14823,enough to think of killing one person? And in any case . . . bad
14824,enough to divide the soul . . . but to rip it into seven pieces . . .”
14825,Slughorn looked deeply troubled now: He was gazing at Riddle
14826,"as though he had never seen him plainly before, and Harry could"
14827,tell that he was regretting entering into the conversation at all.
14828,  498  
14829,HORCRUXES
14830,"“Of course,” he muttered, “this is all hypothetical, what we’re"
14831,"discussing, isn’t it? All academic . . .”"
14832,"“Yes, sir, of course,” said Riddle quickly."
14833,"“But all the same, Tom . . . keep it quiet, what I’ve told — that’s"
14834,"to say, what we’ve discussed. People wouldn’t like to think we’ve"
14835,"been chatting about Horcruxes. It’s a banned subject at Hogwarts,"
14836,you know. . . . Dumbledore’s particularly fierce about it. . . .”
14837,"“I won’t say a word, sir,” said Riddle, and he left, but not before"
14838,"Harry had glimpsed his face, which was full of that same wild hap-"
14839,piness it had worn when he had first found out that he was a wiz-
14840,"ard, the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome"
14841,"features, but made them, somehow, less human. . . ."
14842,"“Thank you, Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Let us go. . . .”"
14843,When Harry landed back on the office floor Dumbledore was
14844,already sitting down behind his desk. Harry sat too and waited for
14845,Dumbledore to speak.
14846,“I have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long
14847,"time,” said Dumbledore at last. “It confirms the theory on which I"
14848,"have been working, it tells me that I am right, and also how very far"
14849,there is still to go. . . .”
14850,Harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old head-
14851,masters and headmistresses in the portraits around the walls was
14852,"awake and listening in on their conversation. A corpulent, red-"
14853,nosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet.
14854,"“Well, Harry,” said Dumbledore, “I am sure you understood the"
14855,"significance of what we just heard. At the same age as you are now,"
14856,"give or take a few months, Tom Riddle was doing all he could to"
14857,find out how to make himself immortal.”
14858, 499    
14859,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14860,"“You think he succeeded then, sir?” asked Harry. “He made a"
14861,Horcrux? And that’s why he didn’t die when he attacked me? He
14862,had a Horcrux hidden somewhere? A bit of his soul was safe?”
14863,"“A bit . . . or more,” said Dumbledore. “You heard Voldemort:"
14864,What he particularly wanted from Horace was an opinion on what
14865,"would happen to the wizard who created more than one Horcrux,"
14866,what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death
14867,"that he would be prepared to murder many times, rip his soul re-"
14868,"peatedly, so as to store it in many, separately concealed Horcruxes."
14869,No book would have given him that information. As far as I
14870,"know — as far, I am sure, as Voldemort knew — no wizard had"
14871,ever done more than tear his soul in two.”
14872,"Dumbledore paused for a moment, marshaling his thoughts,"
14873,"and then said, “Four years ago, I received what I considered certain"
14874,proof that Voldemort had split his soul.”
14875,“Where?” asked Harry “How?”
14876,"“You handed it to me, Harry,” said Dumbledore. “The diary,"
14877,"Riddle’s diary, the one giving instructions on how to reopen the"
14878,Chamber of Secrets.”
14879,"“I don’t understand, sir,” said Harry."
14880,"“Well, although I did not see the Riddle who came out of the di-"
14881,"ary, what you described to me was a phenomenon I had never wit-"
14882,nessed. A mere memory starting to act and think for itself? A mere
14883,"memory, sapping the life out of the girl into whose hands it had"
14884,"fallen? No, something much more sinister had lived inside that"
14885,"book. . . . a fragment of soul, I was almost sure of it. The diary had"
14886,been a Horcrux. But this raised as many questions as it answered.
14887,“What intrigued and alarmed me most was that that diary had
14888,been intended as a weapon as much as a safeguard.”
14889, 500  
14890,HORCRUXES
14891,"“I still don’t understand,” said Harry."
14892,"“Well, it worked as a Horcrux is supposed to work — in other"
14893,"words, the fragment of soul concealed inside it was kept safe and"
14894,had undoubtedly played its part in preventing the death of its
14895,owner. But there could be no doubt that Riddle really wanted that
14896,"diary read, wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or possess some-"
14897,"body else, so that Slytherin’s monster would be unleashed again.”"
14898,"“Well, he didn’t want his hard work to be wasted,” said Harry."
14899,"“He wanted people to know he was Slytherin’s heir, because he"
14900,couldn’t take credit at the time.”
14901,"“Quite correct,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “But don’t you see,"
14902,"Harry, that if he intended the diary to be passed to, or planted on,"
14903,"some future Hogwarts student, he was being remarkably blasé"
14904,about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it. The
14905,"point of a Horcrux is, as Professor Slughorn explained, to keep part"
14906,"of the self hidden and safe, not to fling it into somebody else’s path"
14907,and run the risk that they might destroy it — as indeed happened:
14908,That particular fragment of soul is no more; you saw to that.
14909,“The careless way in which Voldemort regarded this Horcrux
14910,seemed most ominous to me. It suggested that he must have
14911,"made — or been planning to make — more Horcruxes, so that the"
14912,loss of his first would not be so detrimental. I did not wish to be-
14913,"lieve it, but nothing else seemed to make sense."
14914,"“Then you told me, two years later, that on the night that Volde-"
14915,"mort returned to his body, he made a most illuminating and alarm-"
14916,"ing statement to his Death Eaters. ‘I, who have gone further than"
14917,anybody along the path that leads to immortality.’ That was what you
14918,"told me he said. ‘Further than anybody,’ And I thought I knew what"
14919,"that meant, though the Death Eaters did not. He was referring to"
14920, 501   
14921,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14922,"his Horcruxes, Horcruxes in the plural, Harry, which I do not be-"
14923,lieve any other wizard has ever had. Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort
14924,"has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the"
14925,transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explica-
14926,ble if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might
14927,call ‘usual evil’ . . .”
14928,“So he’s made himself impossible to kill by murdering other peo-
14929,"ple?” said Harry. “Why couldn’t he make a Sorcerer’s Stone, or steal"
14930,"one, if he was so interested in immortality?”"
14931,"“Well, we know that he tried to do just that, five years ago,” said"
14932,"Dumbledore. “But there are several reasons why, I think, a Sor-"
14933,cerer’s Stone would appeal less than Horcruxes to Lord Voldemort.
14934,"“While the Elixir of Life does indeed extend life, it must be"
14935,"drunk regularly, for all eternity, if the drinker is to maintain their"
14936,"immortality. Therefore, Voldemort would be entirely dependent"
14937,"on the Elixir, and if it ran out, or was contaminated, or if the Stone"
14938,"was stolen, he would die just like any other man. Voldemort likes"
14939,"to operate alone, remember. I believe that he would have found the"
14940,"thought of being dependent, even on the Elixir, intolerable. Of"
14941,course he was prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the
14942,"horrible part-life to which he was condemned after attacking you,"
14943,"but only to regain a body. Thereafter, I am convinced, he intended"
14944,to continue to rely on his Horcruxes: He would need nothing
14945,"more, if only he could regain a human form. He was already im-"
14946,"mortal, you see . . . or as close to immortal as any man can be."
14947,"“But now, Harry, armed with this information, the crucial mem-"
14948,"ory you have succeeded in procuring for us, we are closer to the se-"
14949,cret of finishing Lord Voldemort than anyone has ever been before.
14950,"You heard him, Harry: ‘Wouldn’t it be better, make you stronger,"
14951,  502 
14952,HORCRUXES
14953,to have your soul in more pieces . . . isn’t seven the most powerfully
14954,magical number . . .’ Isn’t seven the most powerfully magical number.
14955,"Yes, I think the idea of a seven-part soul would greatly appeal to"
14956,Lord Voldemort.”
14957,"“He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror-struck, while"
14958,several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock
14959,and outrage. “But they could be anywhere in the world —
14960,hidden — buried or invisible —”
14961,"“I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,”"
14962,"said Dumbledore calmly “But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Hor-"
14963,"cruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides"
14964,inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a
14965,"spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that,"
14966,he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last
14967,that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece
14968,that lives in his body.”
14969,"“But the six Horcruxes, then,” said Harry, a little desperately,"
14970,“how are we supposed to find them?”
14971,“You are forgetting . . . you have already destroyed one of them.
14972,And I have destroyed another.”
14973,“You have?” said Harry eagerly.
14974,"“Yes indeed,” said Dumbledore, and he raised his blackened,"
14975,"burned-looking hand. “The ring, Harry. Marvolo’s ring. And a ter-"
14976,rible curse there was upon it too. Had it not been — forgive me the
14977,"lack of seemly modesty — for my own prodigious skill, and for"
14978,"Professor Snape’s timely action when I returned to Hogwarts, des-"
14979,"perately injured, I might not have lived to tell the tale. However, a"
14980,withered hand does not seem an unreasonable exchange for a sev-
14981,enth of Voldemort’s soul. The ring is no longer a Horcrux.”
14982, 503   
14983,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14984,“But how did you find it?”
14985,"“Well, as you now know, for many years I have made it my busi-"
14986,ness to discover as much as I can about Voldemort’s past life. I have
14987,"traveled widely, visiting those places he once knew. I stumbled"
14988,across the ring hidden in the ruin of the Gaunts’ house. It seems
14989,that once Voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul in-
14990,"side it, he did not want to wear it anymore. He hid it, protected by"
14991,"many powerful enchantments, in the shack where his ancestors had"
14992,"once lived (Morfin having been carted off to Azkaban, of course),"
14993,never guessing that I might one day take the trouble to visit the
14994,"ruin, or that I might be keeping an eye open for traces of magical"
14995,concealment.
14996,"“However, we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily."
14997,"You destroyed the diary and I the ring, but if we are right in our"
14998,"theory of a seven-part soul, four Horcruxes remain.”"
14999,“And they could be anything?” said Harry. “They could be old
15000,"tin cans or, I dunno, empty potion bottles. . . .”"
15001,"“You are thinking of Portkeys, Harry, which must be ordinary"
15002,"objects, easy to overlook. But would Lord Voldemort use tin cans or"
15003,old potion bottles to guard his own precious soul? You are for-
15004,getting what I have showed you. Lord Voldemort liked to collect
15005,"trophies, and he preferred objects with a powerful magical history."
15006,"His pride, his belief in his own superiority, his determination to"
15007,carve for himself a startling place in magical history; these things
15008,suggest to me that Voldemort would have chosen his Horcruxes
15009,"with some care, favoring objects worthy of the honor.”"
15010,“The diary wasn’t that special.”
15011,"“The diary, as you have said yourself, was proof that he was the"
15012, 504   
15013,HORCRUXES
15014,Heir of Slytherin; I am sure that Voldemort considered it of stu-
15015,pendous importance.”
15016,"“So, the other Horcruxes?” said Harry. “Do you think you know"
15017,"what they are, sir?”"
15018,"“I can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “For the reasons I have al-"
15019,"ready given, I believe that Lord Voldemort would prefer objects"
15020,"that, in themselves, have a certain grandeur. I have therefore"
15021,trawled back through Voldemort’s past to see if I can find evidence
15022,that such artifacts have disappeared around him.”
15023,“The locket!” said Harry loudly. “Hufflepuff ’s cup!”
15024,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling, “I would be prepared to bet —"
15025,"perhaps not my other hand — but a couple of fingers, that they be-"
15026,"came Horcruxes three and four. The remaining two, assuming"
15027,"again that he created a total of six, are more of a problem, but I will"
15028,"hazard a guess that, having secured objects from Hufflepuff and"
15029,"Slytherin, he set out to track down objects owned by Gryffindor or"
15030,"Ravenclaw. Four objects from the four founders would, I am sure,"
15031,have exerted a powerful pull over Voldemort’s imagination. I can-
15032,not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of
15033,"Ravenclaw’s. I am confident, however, that the only known relic of"
15034,Gryffindor remains safe.”
15035,Dumbledore pointed his blackened fingers to the wall behind
15036,"him, where a ruby-encrusted sword reposed within a glass case."
15037,“Do you think that’s why he really wanted to come back to Hog-
15038,"warts, sir?” said Harry. “To try and find something from one of the"
15039,other founders?”
15040,"“My thoughts precisely,” said Dumbledore. “But unfortunately,"
15041,"that does not advance us much further, for he was turned away, or"
15042,  505   
15043,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
15044,"so I believe, without the chance to search the school. I am forced to"
15045,conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four
15046,founders’ objects. He definitely had two — he may have found
15047,three — that is the best we can do for now.”
15048,"“Even if he got something of Ravenclaw’s or of Gryffindor’s, that"
15049,"leaves a sixth Horcrux,” said Harry, counting on his fingers. “Un-"
15050,less he got both?”
15051,"“I don’t think so,” said Dumbledore. “I think I know what the sixth"
15052,Horcrux is. I wonder what you will say when I confess that I have
15053,"been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake, Nagini?”"
15054,"“The snake?” said Harry, startled. “You can use animals as"
15055,Horcruxes?”
15056,"“Well, it is inadvisable to do so,” said Dumbledore, “because to"
15057,confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move
15058,"for itself is obviously a very risky business. However, if my calcula-"
15059,"tions are correct, Voldemort was still at least one Horcrux short of"
15060,his goal of six when he entered your parents’ house with the inten-
15061,tion of killing you.
15062,“He seems to have reserved the process of making Horcruxes for
15063,particularly significant deaths. You would certainly have been that.
15064,"He believed that in killing you, he was destroying the danger the"
15065,prophecy had outlined. He believed he was making himself invin-
15066,cible. I am sure that he was intending to make his final Horcrux
15067,with your death.
15068,"“As we know, he failed. After an interval of some years, however,"
15069,"he used Nagini to kill an old Muggle man, and it might then have"
15070,occurred to him to turn her into his last Horcrux. She underlines
15071,"the Slytherin connection, which enhances Lord Voldemort’s mys-"
15072,tique; I think he is perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything;
15073,  506 
15074,HORCRUXES
15075,"he certainly likes to keep her close, and he seems to have an un-"
15076,"usual amount of control over her, even for a Parselmouth.”"
15077,"“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the"
15078,"locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be"
15079,a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?”
15080,"“An admirably succinct and accurate summary, yes,” said Dum-"
15081,"bledore, bowing his head."
15082,"“So . . . are you still looking for them, sir? Is that where you’ve"
15083,been going when you’ve been leaving the school?”
15084,"“Correct,” said Dumbledore. “I have been looking for a very long"
15085,time. I think . . . perhaps . . . I may be close to finding an-
15086,other one. There are hopeful signs.”
15087,"“And if you do,” said Harry quickly, “can I come with you and"
15088,help get rid of it?”
15089,Dumbledore looked at Harry very intently for a moment before
15090,"saying, “Yes, I think so.”"
15091,"“I can?” said Harry, thoroughly taken aback."
15092,"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. “I think you have"
15093,earned that right.”
15094,Harry felt his heart lift. It was very good not to hear words of
15095,caution and protection for once. The headmasters and head-
15096,mistresses around the walls seemed less impressed by Dumbledore’s
15097,decision; Harry saw a few of them shaking their heads and Phineas
15098,Nigellus actually snorted.
15099,"“Does Voldemort know when a Horcrux is destroyed, sir? Can"
15100,"he feel it?” Harry asked, ignoring the portraits."
15101,"“A very interesting question, Harry. I believe not. I believe that"
15102,"Voldemort is now so immersed in evil, and these crucial parts of"
15103,"himself have been detached for so long, he does not feel as we do."

15105,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
15106,"Perhaps, at the point of death, he might be aware of his loss . . . but"
15107,"he was not aware, for instance, that the diary had been destroyed"
15108,until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy. When Voldemort
15109,discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all its
15110,"powers, I am told that his anger was terrible to behold.”"
15111,“But I thought he meant Lucius Malfoy to smuggle it into Hog-
15112,warts?”
15113,"“Yes, he did, years ago, when he was sure he would be able to"
15114,"create more Horcruxes, but still Lucius was supposed to wait for"
15115,"Voldemort’s say-so, and he never received it, for Voldemort van-"
15116,ished shortly after giving him the diary.
15117,“No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything
15118,"with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully, but he was counting"
15119,too much upon Lucius’s fear of a master who had been gone for years
15120,"and whom Lucius believed dead. Of course, Lucius did not know"
15121,what the diary really was. I understand that Voldemort had told him
15122,the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was
15123,cleverly enchanted. Had Lucius known he held a portion of his mas-
15124,"ter’s soul in his hands, he would undoubtedly have treated it with"
15125,more reverence — but instead he went ahead and carried out the old
15126,plan for his own ends: By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley’s
15127,"daughter, he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incrim-"
15128,"inating magical object in one stroke. Ah, poor Lucius . . . what with"
15129,Voldemort’s fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his
15130,"own gain, and the fiasco at the Ministry last year, I would not be sur-"
15131,prised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment.”
15132,"Harry sat in thought for a moment, then asked, “So if all of his"
15133,"Horcruxes are destroyed, Voldemort could be killed?”"
15134,"“Yes, I think so,” said Dumbledore. “Without his Horcruxes,"
15135,  508   
15136,HORCRUXES
15137,Voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished
15138,"soul. Never forget, though, that while his soul may be damaged be-"
15139,"yond repair, his brain and his magical powers remain intact. It will"
15140,take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like Voldemort
15141,even without his Horcruxes.”
15142,"“But I haven’t got uncommon skill and power,” said Harry, be-"
15143,fore he could stop himself.
15144,"“Yes, you have,” said Dumbledore firmly. “You have a power"
15145,that Voldemort has never had. You can —”
15146,“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was only with
15147,"difficulty that he stopped himself adding, “Big deal!”"
15148,"“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who looked as"
15149,though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from
15150,"saying. “Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a"
15151,great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand
15152,"how unusual you are, Harry.”"
15153,"“So, when the prophecy says that I’ll have ‘power the Dark Lord"
15154,"knows not,’ it just means — love?” asked Harry, feeling a little let"
15155,down.
15156,"“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never forget"
15157,that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort
15158,made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled
15159,you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him —
15160,"and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dan-"
15161,gerous to him!”
15162,“But it comes to the same —”
15163,"“No, it doesn’t!” said Dumbledore, sounding impatient now."
15164,"Pointing at Harry with his black, withered hand, he said, “You are"
15165,setting too much store by the prophecy!”
15166, 509   
15167,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
15168,"“But,” spluttered Harry, “but you said the prophecy means —”"
15169,"“If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy, would it have"
15170,been fulfilled? Would it have meant anything? Of course not! Do
15171,you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been ful-
15172,filled?”
15173,"“But,” said Harry, bewildered, “but last year, you said one of us"
15174,would have to kill the other —”
15175,"“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and"
15176,acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If Voldemort had never mur-
15177,"dered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire"
15178,for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die
15179,"for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not"
15180,"penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you see? Voldemort himself"
15181,"created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you"
15182,any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of
15183,"them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is"
15184,sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort
15185,is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who
15186,would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into ac-
15187,"tion, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most"
15188,"likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!”"
15189,“But —”
15190,"“It is essential that you understand this!” said Dumbledore,"
15191,"standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes"
15192,swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By
15193,"attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remark-"
15194,"able person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for"
15195,the job! It is Voldemort’s fault that you were able to see into his
15196,"thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike"
15197, 510   
15198,HORCRUXES
15199,"language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your"
15200,"privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a"
15201,"gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been se-"
15202,"duced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slight-"
15203,est desire to become one of Voldemort’s followers!”
15204,“Of course I haven’t!” said Harry indignantly. “He killed my
15205,mum and dad!”
15206,"“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dum-"
15207,bledore loudly. “The only protection that can possibly work against
15208,the lure of power like Voldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation
15209,"you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just"
15210,"as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mir-"
15211,"ror that reflected your heart’s desire, and it showed you only the"
15212,"way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches."
15213,"Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what"
15214,you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what
15215,"he was dealing with, but he did not!"
15216,“But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s
15217,"mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you with-"
15218,"out enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do"
15219,"not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a"
15220,"hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the"
15221,incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.”
15222,"“But, sir,” said Harry, making valiant efforts not to sound argu-"
15223,"mentative, “it all comes to the same thing, doesn’t it? I’ve got to try"
15224,"and kill him, or —”"
15225,“Got to?” said Dumbledore. “Of course you’ve got to! But not
15226,"because of the prophecy! Because you, yourself, will never rest until"
15227,"you’ve tried! We both know it! Imagine, please, just for a moment,"
15228,  511   
15229,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
15230,that you had never heard that prophecy! How would you feel about
15231,Voldemort now? Think!”
15232,Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of
15233,"him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius."
15234,He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds
15235,he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside
15236,"his chest, searing his throat."
15237,"“I’d want him finished,” said Harry quietly. “And I’d want to do"
15238,it.”
15239,"“Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the"
15240,prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the
15241,prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. . . . In
15242,"other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn"
15243,your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store
15244,by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you . . . which makes it
15245,"certain, really, that —”"
15246,"“That one of us is going to end up killing the other,” said Harry."
15247,“Yes.”
15248,But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to
15249,"tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged"
15250,into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the
15251,"arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say"
15252,"that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumble-"
15253,"dore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce"
15254,"pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in"

15259,"E      xhausted but delighted with his night’s work, Harry told"
15260,Ron and Hermione everything that had happened during
15261,next morning’s Charms lesson (having first cast the Muffliato spell
15262,upon those nearest them). They were both satisfyingly impressed
15263,by the way he had wheedled the memory out of Slughorn and pos-
15264,itively awed when he told them about Voldemort’s Horcruxes and

15267,"“Wow,” said Ron, when Harry had finally finished telling them"

15270,he was doing. “Wow. You’re actually going to go with Dumbledore

15277,"Brown, Harry noticed, glared at Hermione from a neighboring"

15279,Ron’s arm.
15280,"“Oh yeah,” said Ron, looking down at his shoulders in vague"
15281,surprise. “Sorry . . . looks like we’ve all got horrible dandruff
15282,now. . . .”
15283,He brushed some of the fake snow off Hermione’s shoulder.
15284,Lavender burst into tears. Ron looked immensely guilty and turned
15285,his back on her.
15286,"“We split up,” he told Harry out of the corner of his mouth."
15287,“Last night. When she saw me coming out of the dormitory with
15288,"Hermione. Obviously she couldn’t see you, so she thought it had"
15289,just been the two of us.”
15290,"“Ah,” said Harry. “Well — you don’t mind it’s over, do you?”"
15291,"“No,” Ron admitted. “It was pretty bad while she was yelling,"
15292,but at least I didn’t have to finish it.”
15293,"“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it"
15294,was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up
15295,"too, Harry.”"
15296,Harry thought there was a rather knowing look in her eye as she
15297,"told him that, but she could not possibly know that his insides"
15298,were suddenly dancing the conga. Keeping his face as immobile
15299,"and his voice as indifferent as he could, he asked, “How come?”"
15300,"“Oh, something really silly . . . She said he was always trying to"

15312,"“Oh — oh yeah,” said Harry."
15313,"“Flitwick,” said Ron in a warning tone. The tiny little Charms"
15314,"master was bobbing his way toward them, and Hermione was the"
15315,only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine; her glass
15316,"flask was full of deep crimson liquid, whereas the contents of"
15317,Harry’s and Ron’s were still murky brown.
15318,"“Now, now, boys,” squeaked Professor Flitwick reproachfully. “A"
15319,"little less talk, a little more action . . . Let me see you try. . . .”"
15320,"Together they raised their wands, concentrating with all their"

15323,"“Yes . . . for homework,” said Professor Flitwick, reemerging"
15324,from under the table and pulling shards of glass out of the top of his

15326,They had one of their rare joint free periods after Charms and
15327,walked back to the common room together. Ron seemed to be pos-

15330,"she was grinning about she simply said, “It’s a nice day.” Neither of"

15332,Harry’s brain:
15333,She’s Ron’s sister.

15348,"Harry stared: It was indeed Katie Bell, looking completely"
15349,healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friends.
15350,“I’m really well!” she said happily. “They let me out of St.

15355,"have a decent chance of thrashing Ravenclaw, which means we"
15356,"could still be in the running for the Cup. Listen, Katie . . .”"
15357,He had to put the question to her at once; his curiosity even
15358,drove Ginny temporarily from his brain. He dropped his voice as
15359,Katie’s friends started gathering up their things; apparently they
15360,were late for Transfiguration.
15361,“. . . that necklace . . . can you remember who gave it to you now?”
15362,"“No,” said Katie, shaking her head ruefully. “Everyone’s been"
15363,"asking me, but I haven’t got a clue. The last thing I remember was"
15364,walking into the ladies’ in the Three Broomsticks.”
15365,"“You definitely went into the bathroom, then?” said Hermione."

15367,SECTUMSEMPRA
15368,"“Well, I know I pushed open the door,” said Katie, “so I suppose"
15369,"whoever Imperiused me was standing just behind it. After that, my"
15370,"memory’s a blank until about two weeks ago in St. Mungo’s. Listen,"
15371,"I’d better go, I wouldn’t put it past McGonagall to give me lines"
15372,even if it is my first day back. . . .”
15373,"She caught up her bag and books and hurried after her friends,"
15374,"leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to sit down at a window table"
15375,and ponder what she had told them.
15376,“So it must have been a girl or a woman who gave Katie the
15377,"necklace,” said Hermione, “to be in the ladies’ bathroom.”"
15378,"“Or someone who looked like a girl or a woman,” said Harry."
15379,"“Don’t forget, there was a cauldron full of Polyjuice Potion at Hog-"
15380,warts. We know some of it got stolen. . . .”
15381,"In his mind’s eye, he watched a parade of Crabbes and Goyles"
15382,"prance past, all transformed into girls."
15383,"“I think I’m going to take another swig of Felix,” said Harry,"
15384,“and have a go at the Room of Requirement again.”
15385,"“That would be a complete waste of potion,” said Hermione"
15386,"flatly, putting down the copy of Spellman’s Syllabary she had just"
15387,"taken out of her bag. “Luck can only get you so far, Harry. The sit-"
15388,uation with Slughorn was different; you always had the ability to
15389,"persuade him, you just needed to tweak the circumstances a bit."
15390,"Luck isn’t enough to get you through a powerful enchantment,"
15391,though. Don’t go wasting the rest of that potion! You’ll need all the
15392,luck you can get if Dumbledore takes you along with him . . .” She
15393,dropped her voice to a whisper.
15394,"“Couldn’t we make some more?” Ron asked Harry, ignoring"
15395,Hermione. “It’d be great to have a stock of it. . . . Have a look in
15396,the book . . .”
15397,  517  
15398,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15399,Harry pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag
15400,and looked up Felix Felicis.
15401,"“Blimey, it’s seriously complicated,” he said, running an eye"
15402,down the list of ingredients. “And it takes six months . . . You’ve
15403,got to let it stew. . . .”
15404,"“Typical,” said Ron."
15405,Harry was about to put his book away again when he noticed
15406,"the corner of a page folded down; turning to it, he saw the Sectum-"
15407,"sempra spell, captioned “For Enemies,” that he had marked a few"
15408,"weeks previously. He had still not found out what it did, mainly"
15409,"because he did not want to test it around Hermione, but he was"
15410,considering trying it out on McLaggen next time he came up be-
15411,hind him unawares.
15412,The only person who was not particularly pleased to see Katie
15413,"Bell back at school was Dean Thomas, because he would no longer"
15414,be required to fill her place as Chaser. He took the blow stoically
15415,"enough when Harry told him, merely grunting and shrugging, but"
15416,Harry had the distinct feeling as he walked away that Dean and
15417,Seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back.
15418,The following fortnight saw the best Quidditch practices Harry
15419,had known as Captain. His team was so pleased to be rid of
15420,"McLaggen, so glad to have Katie back at last, that they were flying"
15421,extremely well.
15422,Ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with Dean;
15423,"on the contrary, she was the life and soul of the team. Her imita-"
15424,tions of Ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal
15425,"posts as the Quaffle sped toward him, or of Harry bellowing orders"
15426,"at McLaggen before being knocked out cold, kept them all highly"
15427,"amused. Harry, laughing with the others, was glad to have an"
15428, 518  
15429,SECTUMSEMPRA
15430,innocent reason to look at Ginny; he had received several more
15431,Bludger injuries during practice because he had not been keeping
15432,his eyes on the Snitch.
15433,The battle still raged inside his head: Ginny or Ron? Sometimes
15434,he thought that the post-Lavender Ron might not mind too much
15435,"if he asked Ginny out, but then he remembered Ron’s expression"
15436,"when he had seen her kissing Dean, and was sure that Ron would"
15437,consider it base treachery if Harry so much as held her hand. . . .
15438,"Yet Harry could not help himself talking to Ginny, laughing"
15439,"with her, walking back from practice with her; however much his"
15440,"conscience ached, he found himself wondering how best to get her"
15441,on her own. It would have been ideal if Slughorn had given another
15442,"of his little parties, for Ron would not be around — but unfortu-"
15443,"nately, Slughorn seemed to have given them up. Once or twice"
15444,"Harry considered asking for Hermione’s help, but he did not think"
15445,he could stand seeing the smug look on her face; he thought he
15446,caught it sometimes when Hermione spotted him staring at Ginny
15447,"or laughing at her jokes. And to complicate matters, he had the"
15448,"nagging worry that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask"
15449,Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that
15450,she was too popular for her own good.
15451,"All in all, the temptation to take another gulp of Felix Felicis was"
15452,"becoming stronger by the day, for surely this was a case for, as Her-"
15453,"mione put it, “tweaking the circumstances”? The balmy days slid"
15454,"gently through May, and Ron seemed to be there at Harry’s shoul-"
15455,der every time he saw Ginny. Harry found himself longing for a
15456,stroke of luck that would somehow cause Ron to realize that noth-
15457,ing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister
15458,falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer
15459,  519  
15460,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15461,than a few seconds. There seemed no chance of either while the fi-
15462,nal Quidditch game of the season was looming; Ron wanted to talk
15463,tactics with Harry all the time and had little thought for anything
15464,else.
15465,Ron was not unique in this respect; interest in the Gryffindor-
15466,Ravenclaw game was running extremely high throughout the
15467,"school, for the match would decide the Championship, which was"
15468,still wide open. If Gryffindor beat Ravenclaw by a margin of three
15469,"hundred points (a tall order, and yet Harry had never known his"
15470,team to fly better) then they would win the Championship. If they
15471,"won by less than three hundred points, they would come second to"
15472,Ravenclaw; if they lost by a hundred points they would be third be-
15473,"hind Hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred, they"
15474,"would be in fourth place and nobody, Harry thought, would ever,"
15475,ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained Gryffin-
15476,dor to their first bottom-of-the-table defeat in two centuries.
15477,The run-up to this crucial match had all the usual features:
15478,members of rival Houses attempting to intimidate opposing teams
15479,in the corridors; unpleasant chants about individual players being
15480,rehearsed loudly as they passed; the team members themselves ei-
15481,ther swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing
15482,"into bathrooms between classes to throw up. Somehow, the game"
15483,had become inextricably linked in Harry’s mind with success or
15484,failure in his plans for Ginny. He could not help feeling that if they
15485,"won by more than three hundred points, the scenes of euphoria"
15486,and a nice loud after-match party might be just as good as a hearty
15487,swig of Felix Felicis.
15488,"In the midst of all his preoccupations, Harry had not forgotten"
15489,his other ambition: finding out what Malfoy was up to in the
15490, 520  
15491,SECTUMSEMPRA
15492,"Room of Requirement. He was still checking the Marauder’s Map,"
15493,"and as he was unable to locate Malfoy on it, deduced that Malfoy"
15494,was still spending plenty of time within the room. Although Harry
15495,was losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the
15496,"Room of Requirement, he attempted it whenever he was in the"
15497,"vicinity, but no matter how he reworded his request, the wall re-"
15498,mained firmly doorless.
15499,"A few days before the match against Ravenclaw, Harry found"
15500,"himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room,"
15501,Ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet
15502,"again, and Hermione having dashed off to see Professor Vector"
15503,about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last Arith-
15504,"mancy essay. More out of habit than anything, Harry made his"
15505,"usual detour along the seventh-floor corridor, checking the Ma-"
15506,rauder’s Map as he went. For a moment he could not find Malfoy
15507,anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the Room of
15508,"Requirement again, but then he saw Malfoy’s tiny, labeled dot"
15509,"standing in a boys’ bathroom on the floor below, accompanied, not"
15510,"by Crabbe or Goyle, but by Moaning Myrtle."
15511,Harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he
15512,walked right into a suit of armor. The loud crash brought him out
15513,"of his reverie; hurrying from the scene lest Filch turn up, he dashed"
15514,down the marble staircase and along the passageway below. Out-
15515,"side the bathroom, he pressed his ear against the door. He could"
15516,not hear anything. He very quietly pushed the door open.
15517,"Draco Malfoy was standing with his back to the door, his hands"
15518,"clutching either side of the sink, his white-blond head bowed."
15519,"“Don’t,” crooned Moaning Myrtle’s voice from one of the cubi-"
15520,cles. “Don’t . . . tell me what’s wrong . . . I can help you. . . .”
15521, 521  
15522,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15523,"“No one can help me,” said Malfoy. His whole body was shak-"
15524,ing. “I can’t do it. . . . I can’t. . . . It won’t work . . . and unless I do
15525,it soon . . . he says he’ll kill me. . . .”
15526,"And Harry realized, with a shock so huge it seemed to root him"
15527,"to the spot, that Malfoy was crying — actually crying — tears"
15528,streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin. Malfoy gasped
15529,"and gulped and then, with a great shudder, looked up into the"
15530,cracked mirror and saw Harry staring at him over his shoulder.
15531,"Malfoy wheeled around, drawing his wand. Instinctively, Harry"
15532,"pulled out his own. Malfoy’s hex missed Harry by inches, shatter-"
15533,"ing the lamp on the wall beside him; Harry threw himself sideways,"
15534,"thought Levicorpus! and flicked his wand, but Malfoy blocked the"
15535,jinx and raised his wand for another —
15536,"“No! No! Stop it!” squealed Moaning Myrtle, her voice echoing"
15537,loudly around the tiled room. “Stop! STOP!”
15538,There was a loud bang and the bin behind Harry exploded;
15539,Harry attempted a Leg-Locker Curse that backfired off the wall be-
15540,hind Malfoy’s ear and smashed the cistern beneath Moaning Myr-
15541,"tle, who screamed loudly; water poured everywhere and Harry"
15542,"slipped as Malfoy, his face contorted, cried, “Cruci —”"
15543,"“SECTUMSEMPRA!” bellowed Harry from the floor, waving his"
15544,wand wildly.
15545,Blood spurted from Malfoy’s face and chest as though he had
15546,been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backward and
15547,"collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash, his wand"
15548,falling from his limp right hand.
15549,“No —” gasped Harry.
15550,"Slipping and staggering, Harry got to his feet and plunged"
15551,  522    
15552,SECTUMSEMPRA
15553,"toward Malfoy, whose face was now shining scarlet, his white hands"
15554,scrabbling at his blood-soaked chest.
15555,“No — I didn’t —”
15556,Harry did not know what he was saying; he fell to his knees be-
15557,"side Malfoy, who was shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own"
15558,blood. Moaning Myrtle let out a deafening scream: “MURDER!
15559,MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!”
15560,"The door banged open behind Harry and he looked up, terri-"
15561,"fied: Snape had burst into the room, his face livid. Pushing Harry"
15562,"roughly aside, he knelt over Malfoy, drew his wand, and traced it"
15563,"over the deep wounds Harry’s curse had made, muttering an in-"
15564,cantation that sounded almost like song. The flow of blood seemed
15565,to ease; Snape wiped the residue from Malfoy’s face and repeated
15566,his spell. Now the wounds seemed to be knitting.
15567,"Harry was still watching, horrified by what he had done, barely"
15568,aware that he too was soaked in blood and water. Moaning Myrtle
15569,was still sobbing and wailing overhead. When Snape had per-
15570,"formed his countercurse for the third time, he half-lifted Malfoy"
15571,into a standing position.
15572,“You need the hospital wing. There may be a certain amount of
15573,"scarring, but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even"
15574,that. . . . Come. . . .”
15575,"He supported Malfoy across the bathroom, turning at the door"
15576,"to say in a voice of cold fury, “And you, Potter . . . You wait here for"
15577,me.”
15578,It did not occur to Harry for a second to disobey. He stood up
15579,"slowly, shaking, and looked down at the wet floor. There were"
15580,bloodstains floating like crimson flowers across its surface. He
15581, 523  
15582,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15583,could not even find it in himself to tell Moaning Myrtle to be
15584,"quiet, as she continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident"
15585,enjoyment.
15586,Snape returned ten minutes later. He stepped into the bathroom
15587,and closed the door behind him.
15588,"“Go,” he said to Myrtle, and she swooped back into her toilet at"
15589,"once, leaving a ringing silence behind her."
15590,"“I didn’t mean it to happen,” said Harry at once. His voice"
15591,"echoed in the cold, watery space. “I didn’t know what that spell"
15592,did.”
15593,"But Snape ignored this. “Apparently I underestimated you, Pot-"
15594,"ter,” he said quietly. “Who would have thought you knew such"
15595,Dark Magic? Who taught you that spell?”
15596,“I — read about it somewhere.”
15597,“Where?”
15598,"“It was — a library book,” Harry invented wildly. “I can’t re-"
15599,member what it was call —”
15600,"“Liar,” said Snape. Harry’s throat went dry. He knew what Snape"
15601,was going to do and he had never been able to prevent it. . . .
15602,The bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eyes; he struggled
15603,"to block out all thought, but try as he might, the Half-Blood"
15604,Prince’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making swam hazily to the fore-
15605,front of his mind.
15606,"And then he was staring at Snape again, in the midst of this"
15607,"wrecked, soaked bathroom. He stared into Snape’s black eyes, hop-"
15608,"ing against hope that Snape had not seen what he feared, but —"
15609,"“Bring me your schoolbag,” said Snape softly, “and all of your"
15610,schoolbooks. All of them. Bring them to me here. Now!”
15611,There was no point arguing. Harry turned at once and splashed
15612,  524  
15613,SECTUMSEMPRA
15614,"out of the bathroom. Once in the corridor, he broke into a run to-"
15615,ward Gryffindor Tower. Most people were walking the other way;
15616,"they gaped at him, drenched in water and blood, but he answered"
15617,none of the questions fired at him as he ran past.
15618,He felt stunned; it was as though a beloved pet had turned sud-
15619,denly savage; what had the Prince been thinking to copy such a
15620,spell into his book? And what would happen when Snape saw it?
15621,Would he tell Slughorn — Harry’s stomach churned — how
15622,Harry had been achieving such good results in Potions all year?
15623,Would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught Harry so
15624,much . . . the book that had become a kind of guide and friend?
15625,Harry could not let it happen. . . . He could not . . .
15626,“Where’ve you — ? Why are you soaking — ? Is that blood?”
15627,"Ron was standing at the top of the stairs, looking bewildered at"
15628,the sight of Harry.
15629,"“I need your book,” Harry panted. “Your Potions book. Quick"
15630,. . . give it to me . . .”
15631,“But what about the Half-Blood —”
15632,“I’ll explain later!”
15633,Ron pulled his copy of Advanced Potion-Making out of his bag
15634,and handed it over; Harry sprinted off past him and back to the
15635,"common room. Here, he seized his schoolbag, ignoring the amazed"
15636,"looks of several people who had already finished their dinner, threw"
15637,"himself back out of the portrait hole, and hurtled off along the"
15638,seventh-floor corridor.
15639,"He skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing trolls, closed"
15640,"his eyes, and began to walk."
15641,I need a place to hide my book. . . . I need a place to hide my book.

15643, 525    
15644,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15645,Three times he walked up and down in front of the stretch of
15646,"blank wall. When he opened his eyes, there it was at last: the door"
15647,"to the Room of Requirement. Harry wrenched it open, flung him-"
15648,"self inside, and slammed it shut."
15649,"He gasped. Despite his haste, his panic, his fear of what awaited"
15650,"him back in the bathroom, he could not help but be overawed by"
15651,what he was looking at. He was standing in a room the size of a
15652,"large cathedral, whose high windows were sending shafts of light"
15653,"down upon what looked like a city with towering walls, built of"
15654,what Harry knew must be objects hidden by generations of Hog-
15655,warts inhabitants. There were alleyways and roads bordered by tee-
15656,"tering piles of broken and damaged furniture, stowed away,"
15657,"perhaps, to hide the evidence of mishandled magic, or else hidden"
15658,by castle-proud house-elves. There were thousands and thousands
15659,"of books, no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen. There were"
15660,"winged catapults and Fanged Frisbees, some still with enough life in"
15661,them to hover halfheartedly over the mountains of other forbidden
15662,"items; there were chipped bottles of congealed potions, hats, jewels,"
15663,"cloaks; there were what looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles"
15664,"whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, and a"
15665,"heavy, bloodstained axe."
15666,Harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyways between
15667,all this hidden treasure. He turned right past an enormous stuffed
15668,"troll, ran on a short way, took a left at the broken Vanishing Cabi-"
15669,"net in which Montague had got lost the previous year, finally paus-"
15670,ing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at
15671,its blistered surface. He opened one of the cupboard’s creaking
15672,doors: It had already been used as a hiding place for something in a
15673,cage that had long since died; its skeleton had five legs. He stuffed
15674, 526    
15675,SECTUMSEMPRA
15676,the Half-Blood Prince’s book behind the cage and slammed the
15677,"door. He paused for a moment, his heart thumping horribly, gaz-"
15678,ing around at all the clutter. . . . Would he be able to find this spot
15679,again amidst all this junk? Seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old
15680,"warlock from on top of a nearby crate, he stood it on top of the"
15681,"cupboard where the book was now hidden, perched a dusty old wig"
15682,and a tarnished tiara on the statue’s head to make it more distinc-
15683,"tive, then sprinted back through the alleyways of hidden junk as"
15684,"fast as he could go, back to the door, back out onto the corridor,"
15685,"where he slammed the door behind him, and it turned at once back"
15686,into stone.
15687,"Harry ran flat-out toward the bathroom on the floor below,"
15688,cramming Ron’s copy of Advanced Potion-Making into his bag as he
15689,"did so. A minute later, he was back in front of Snape, who held out"
15690,"his hand wordlessly for Harry’s schoolbag. Harry handed it over,"
15691,"panting, a searing pain in his chest, and waited."
15692,"One by one, Snape extracted Harry’s books and examined them."
15693,"Finally, the only book left was the Potions book, which he looked"
15694,at very carefully before speaking.
15695,"“This is your copy of Advanced Potion-Making, is it, Potter?”"
15696,"“Yes,” said Harry, still breathing hard."
15697,"“You’re quite sure of that, are you, Potter?”"
15698,"“Yes,” said Harry, with a touch more defiance."
15699,“This is the copy of Advanced Potion-Making that you purchased
15700,from Flourish and Blotts?”
15701,"“Yes,” said Harry firmly."
15702,"“Then why,” asked Snape, “does it have the name ‘Roonil Waz-"
15703,lib’ written inside the front cover?”
15704,"Harry’s heart missed a beat. “That’s my nickname,” he said."
15705,  527 
15706,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15707,"“Your nickname,” repeated Snape."
15708,"“Yeah . . . that’s what my friends call me,” said Harry."
15709,"“I understand what a nickname is,” said Snape. The cold, black"
15710,eyes were boring once more into Harry’s; he tried not to look into
15711,them. Close your mind. . . . Close your mind. . . . But he had never
15712,learned how to do it properly. . . .
15713,"“Do you know what I think, Potter?” said Snape, very quietly. “I"
15714,think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention
15715,"with me every Saturday until the end of term. What do you think,"
15716,Potter?”
15717,"“I — I don’t agree, sir,” said Harry, still refusing to look into"
15718,Snape’s eyes.
15719,"“Well, we shall see how you feel after your detentions,” said"
15720,"Snape. “Ten o’clock Saturday morning, Potter. My office.”"
15721,"“But sir . . .” said Harry, looking up desperately. “Quidditch . . ."
15722,the last match of the . . .”
15723,"“Ten o’clock,” whispered Snape, with a smile that showed his"
15724,"yellow teeth. “Poor Gryffindor . . . fourth place this year, I"
15725,fear . . .”
15726,"And he left the bathroom without another word, leaving Harry"
15727,"to stare into the cracked mirror, feeling sicker, he was sure, than"
15728,Ron had ever felt in his life.
15729,"“I won’t say ‘I told you so,’ ” said Hermione, an hour later in the"
15730,common room.
15731,"“Leave it, Hermione,” said Ron angrily."
15732,Harry had never made it to dinner; he had no appetite at all. He
15733,"had just finished telling Ron, Hermione, and Ginny what had hap-"
15734,"pened, not that there seemed to have been much need. The news"
15735,had traveled very fast: Apparently Moaning Myrtle had taken it
15736, 528   
15737,SECTUMSEMPRA
15738,upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the
15739,story; Malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by
15740,"Pansy Parkinson, who had lost no time in vilifying Harry far and"
15741,"wide, and Snape had told the staff precisely what had happened."
15742,Harry had already been called out of the common room to endure
15743,fifteen highly unpleasant minutes in the company of Professor
15744,"McGonagall, who had told him he was lucky not to have been ex-"
15745,pelled and that she supported wholeheartedly Snape’s punishment
15746,of detention every Saturday until the end of term.
15747,"“I told you there was something wrong with that Prince person,”"
15748,"Hermione said, evidently unable to stop herself. “And I was right,"
15749,wasn’t I?”
15750,"“No, I don’t think you were,” said Harry stubbornly."
15751,He was having a bad enough time without Hermione lecturing
15752,him; the looks on the Gryffindor team’s faces when he had told
15753,them he would not be able to play on Saturday had been the worst
15754,punishment of all. He could feel Ginny’s eyes on him now but did
15755,not meet them; he did not want to see disappointment or anger
15756,there. He had just told her that she would be playing Seeker on Sat-
15757,urday and that Dean would be rejoining the team as Chaser in her
15758,"place. Perhaps, if they won, Ginny and Dean would make up dur-"
15759,ing the post-match euphoria. . . . The thought went through
15760,Harry like an icy knife. . . .
15761,"“Harry,” said Hermione, “how can you still stick up for that"
15762,book when that spell —”
15763,“Will you stop harping on about the book!” snapped Harry.
15764,“The Prince only copied it out! It’s not like he was advising anyone
15765,"to use it! For all we know, he was making a note of something that"
15766,had been used against him!”
15767, 529  
15768,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15769,"“I don’t believe this,” said Hermione. “You’re actually defend-"
15770,ing —”
15771,“I’m not defending what I did!” said Harry quickly. “I wish I
15772,"hadn’t done it, and not just because I’ve got about a dozen deten-"
15773,"tions. You know I wouldn’t’ve used a spell like that, not even on"
15774,"Malfoy, but you can’t blame the Prince, he hadn’t written ‘try this"
15775,"out, it’s really good’ — he was just making notes for himself, wasn’t"
15776,"he, not for anyone else. . . .”"
15777,"“Are you telling me,” said Hermione, “that you’re going to go"
15778,back — ?”
15779,"“And get the book? Yeah, I am,” said Harry forcefully. “Listen,"
15780,without the Prince I’d never have won the Felix Felicis. I’d never
15781,"have known how to save Ron from poisoning, I’d never have —”"
15782,"“— got a reputation for Potions brilliance you don’t deserve,”"
15783,said Hermione nastily.
15784,"“Give it a rest, Hermione!” said Ginny, and Harry was so"
15785,"amazed, so grateful, he looked up. “By the sound of it, Malfoy was"
15786,"trying to use an Unforgivable Curse, you should be glad Harry had"
15787,something good up his sleeve!”
15788,"“Well, of course I’m glad Harry wasn’t cursed!” said Hermione,"
15789,"clearly stung. “But you can’t call that Sectumsempra spell good,"
15790,"Ginny, look where it’s landed him! And I’d have thought, seeing"
15791,what this has done to your chances in the match —”
15792,"“Oh, don’t start acting as though you understand Quidditch,”"
15793,"snapped Ginny, “you’ll only embarrass yourself.”"
15794,"Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always"
15795,"got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded,"
15796,"glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then"
15797,"snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however,"
15798, 530 
15799,SECTUMSEMPRA
15800,"little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all"
15801,"of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of"
15802,the evening.
15803,His lightheartedness was short-lived. There were Slytherin
15804,"taunts to be endured next day, not to mention much anger from"
15805,"fellow Gryffindors, who were most unhappy that their Captain had"
15806,got himself banned from the final match of the season. By Saturday
15807,"morning, whatever he might have told Hermione, Harry would"
15808,have gladly exchanged all the Felix Felicis in the world to be walk-
15809,"ing down to the Quidditch pitch with Ron, Ginny, and the others."
15810,It was almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of students
15811,"streaming out into the sunshine, all of them wearing rosettes and"
15812,"hats and brandishing banners and scarves, to descend the stone"
15813,steps into the dungeons and walk until the distant sounds of the
15814,"crowd were quite obliterated, knowing that he would not be able to"
15815,hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan.
15816,"“Ah, Potter,” said Snape, when Harry had knocked on his door"
15817,"and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that Snape, despite"
15818,"teaching floors above now, had not vacated; it was as dimly lit as"
15819,ever and the same slimy dead objects were suspended in colored
15820,"potions all around the walls. Ominously, there were many cob-"
15821,webbed boxes piled on a table where Harry was clearly supposed to
15822,"sit; they had an aura of tedious, hard, and pointless work about"
15823,them.
15824,“Mr. Filch has been looking for someone to clear out these old
15825,"files,” said Snape softly. “They are the records of other Hogwarts"
15826,wrongdoers and their punishments. Where the ink has grown
15827,"faint, or the cards have suffered damage from mice, we would like"
15828,"you to copy out the crimes and punishments afresh and, making"
15829, 531  
15830,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15831,"sure that they are in alphabetical order, replace them in the boxes."
15832,You will not use magic.”
15833,"“Right, Professor,” said Harry, with as much contempt as he"
15834,could put into the last three syllables.
15835,"“I thought you could start,” said Snape, a malicious smile on his"
15836,"lips, “with boxes one thousand and twelve to one thousand and"
15837,"fifty-six. You will find some familiar names in there, which should"
15838,"add interest to the task. Here, you see . . .”"
15839,He pulled out a card from one of the topmost boxes with a flour-
15840,"ish and read, “ ‘James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an"
15841,illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size.
15842,Double detention.’ ” Snape sneered. “It must be such a comfort to
15843,"think that, though they are gone, a record of their great achieve-"
15844,ments remains. . . .”
15845,Harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stom-
15846,"ach. Biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating, he sat down in"
15847,front of the boxes and pulled one toward him.
15848,"It was, as Harry had anticipated, useless, boring work, punctu-"
15849,ated (as Snape had clearly planned) with the regular jolt in the
15850,"stomach that meant he had just read his father or Sirius’s names,"
15851,"usually coupled together in various petty misdeeds, occasionally ac-"
15852,companied by those of Remus Lupin and Peter Pettigrew. And
15853,"while he copied out all their various offenses and punishments, he"
15854,"wondered what was going on outside, where the match would have"
15855,just started . . . Ginny playing Seeker against Cho . . .
15856,Harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the
15857,wall. It seemed to be moving half as fast as a regular clock; perhaps
15858,Snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly? He could not have been
15859,here for only half an hour . . . an hour . . . an hour and a half. . . .
15860,  532  
15861,SECTUMSEMPRA
15862,Harry’s stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half
15863,"past twelve. Snape, who had not spoken at all since setting Harry"
15864,"his task, finally looked up at ten past one."
15865,"“I think that will do,” he said coldly. “Mark the place you have"
15866,reached. You will continue at ten o’clock next Saturday.”
15867,"“Yes, sir.”"
15868,Harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried
15869,"out of the door before Snape could change his mind, racing back"
15870,"up the stone steps, straining his ears to hear a sound from the pitch,"
15871,"but all was quiet. . . . It was over, then. . . ."
15872,"He hesitated outside the crowded Great Hall, then ran up the"
15873,"marble staircase; whether Gryffindor had won or lost, the team"
15874,usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room.
15875,"“Quid agis?” he said tentatively to the Fat Lady, wondering what"
15876,he would find inside.
15877,"Her expression was unreadable as she replied, “You’ll see.”"
15878,And she swung forward.
15879,A roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her. Harry
15880,gaped as people began to scream at the sight of him; several hands
15881,pulled him into the room.
15882,"“We won!” yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the"
15883,silver Cup at Harry. “We won! Four hundred and fifty to a hundred
15884,and forty! We won!”
15885,Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she
15886,"had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around"
15887,"him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying"
15888,"about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her."
15889,After several long moments — or it might have been half an
15890,hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The
15891, 533   
15892,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
15893,room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and
15894,there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the
15895,top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass
15896,"in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw"
15897,"something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron."
15898,"At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an ex-"
15899,pression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a
15900,"fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny"
15901,"jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you"
15902,must.
15903,"The creature in his chest roaring in triumph, he grinned down at"
15904,Ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole. A long
15905,"walk in the grounds seemed indicated, during which — if they had"
15906,time — they might discuss the match.
15907, 534   
15908,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15909,THE SEER OVERHEARD
15910,T       he fact that Harry Potter was going out with Ginny
15911,"Weasley seemed to interest a great number of people, most"
15912,"of them girls, yet Harry found himself newly and happily impervi-"
15913,"ous to gossip over the next few weeks. After all, it made a very nice"
15914,change to be talked about because of something that was making
15915,"him happier than he could remember being for a very long time,"
15916,rather than because he had been involved in horrific scenes of Dark
15917,Magic.
15918,"“You’d think people had better things to gossip about,” said"
15919,"Ginny, as she sat on the common room floor, leaning against"
15920,Harry’s legs and reading the Daily Prophet. “Three dementor at-
15921,"tacks in a week, and all Romilda Vane does is ask me if it’s true"
15922,you’ve got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest.”
15923,Ron and Hermione both roared with laughter. Harry ignored
15924,them.
15925, 535   
15926,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15927,“What did you tell her?”
15928,"“I told her it’s a Hungarian Horntail,” said Ginny, turning a"
15929,page of the newspaper idly. “Much more macho.”
15930,"“Thanks,” said Harry, grinning. “And what did you tell her"
15931,Ron’s got?”
15932,"“A Pygmy Puff, but I didn’t say where.”"
15933,Ron scowled as Hermione rolled around laughing.
15934,"“Watch it,” he said, pointing warningly at Harry and Ginny."
15935,“Just because I’ve given my permission doesn’t mean I can’t with-
15936,draw it —”
15937,"“ ‘Your permission,’ ” scoffed Ginny. “Since when did you give me"
15938,"permission to do anything? Anyway, you said yourself you’d rather"
15939,it was Harry than Michael or Dean.”
15940,"“Yeah, I would,” said Ron grudgingly. “And just as long as you"
15941,don’t start snogging each other in public —”
15942,"“You filthy hypocrite! What about you and Lavender, thrashing"
15943,around like a pair of eels all over the place?” demanded Ginny.
15944,But Ron’s tolerance was not to be tested much as they moved
15945,"into June, for Harry and Ginny’s time together was becoming in-"
15946,creasingly restricted. Ginny’s O.W.L.s were approaching and she
15947,was therefore forced to study for hours into the night. On one such
15948,"evening, when Ginny had retired to the library, and Harry was sit-"
15949,"ting beside the window in the common room, supposedly finishing"
15950,his Herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly
15951,happy hour he had spent down by the lake with Ginny at lunch-
15952,"time, Hermione dropped into the seat between him and Ron with"
15953,an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face.
15954,"“I want to talk to you, Harry.”"
15955,"“What about?” said Harry suspiciously. Only the previous day,"
15956, 536  
15957,THE SEER OVERHEARD
15958,Hermione had told him off for distracting Ginny when she ought
15959,to be working hard for her examinations.
15960,“The so-called Half-Blood Prince.”
15961,"“Oh, not again,” he groaned. “Will you please drop it?”"
15962,He had not dared to return to the Room of Requirement to re-
15963,"trieve his book, and his performance in Potions was suffering ac-"
15964,"cordingly (though Slughorn, who approved of Ginny, had jocularly"
15965,attributed this to Harry being lovesick). But Harry was sure that
15966,Snape had not yet given up hope of laying hands on the Prince’s
15967,"book, and was determined to leave it where it was while Snape re-"
15968,mained on the lookout.
15969,"“I’m not dropping it,” said Hermione firmly, “until you’ve heard"
15970,"me out. Now, I’ve been trying to find out a bit about who might"
15971,make a hobby of inventing Dark spells —”
15972,“He didn’t make a hobby of it —”
15973,"“He, he — who says it’s a he?”"
15974,"“We’ve been through this,” said Harry crossly. “Prince, Hermi-"
15975,"one, Prince!”"
15976,"“Right!” said Hermione, red patches blazing in her cheeks as she"
15977,pulled a very old piece of newsprint out of her pocket and slammed
15978,it down on the table in front of Harry. “Look at that! Look at the
15979,picture!”
15980,Harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the
15981,"moving photograph, yellowed with age; Ron leaned over for a look"
15982,too. The picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen. She was not
15983,"pretty; she looked simultaneously cross and sullen, with heavy"
15984,"brows and a long, pallid face. Underneath the photograph was the"
15985,"caption: Eileen Prince, Captain of the Hogwarts Gobstones"
15986,Team.
15987, 537  
15988,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15989,"“So?” said Harry, scanning the short news item to which the pic-"
15990,ture belonged; it was a rather dull story about interschool compe-
15991,titions.
15992,"“Her name was Eileen Prince. Prince, Harry.”"
15993,"They looked at each other, and Harry realized what Hermione"
15994,was trying to say. He burst out laughing.
15995,“No way.”
15996,“What?”
15997,"“You think she was the Half-Blood . . . ? Oh, come on.”"
15998,"“Well, why not? Harry, there aren’t any real princes in the Wiz-"
15999,"arding world! It’s either a nickname, a made-up title somebody’s"
16000,"given themselves, or it could be their actual name, couldn’t it? No,"
16001,"listen! If, say, her father was a wizard whose surname was Prince,"
16002,"and her mother was a Muggle, then that would make her a ‘half-"
16003,blood Prince’!”
16004,"“Yeah, very ingenious, Hermione . . .”"
16005,“But it would! Maybe she was proud of being half a Prince!”
16006,"“Listen, Hermione, I can tell it’s not a girl. I can just tell.”"
16007,“The truth is that you don’t think a girl would have been clever
16008,"enough,” said Hermione angrily."
16009,“How can I have hung round with you for five years and not
16010,"think girls are clever?” said Harry, stung by this. “It’s the way he"
16011,"writes, I just know the Prince was a bloke, I can tell. This girl hasn’t"
16012,got anything to do with it. Where did you get this anyway?”
16013,"“The library,” said Hermione predictably. “There’s a whole col-"
16014,"lection of old Prophets up there. Well, I’m going to find out more"
16015,about Eileen Prince if I can.”
16016,"“Enjoy yourself,” said Harry irritably."
16017,"“I will,” said Hermione. “And the first place I’ll look,” she shot"
16018, 538    
16019,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16020,"at him, as she reached the portrait hole, “is records of old Potions"
16021,awards!”
16022,"Harry scowled after her for a moment, then continued his con-"
16023,templation of the darkening sky.
16024,"“She’s just never got over you outperforming her in Potions,”"
16025,"said Ron, returning to his copy of A Thousand Magical Herbs and"
16026,Fungi.
16027,"“You don’t think I’m mad, wanting that book back, do you?”"
16028,"“ ’Course not,” said Ron robustly. “He was a genius, the Prince."
16029,Anyway . . . without his bezoar tip . . .” He drew his finger signifi-
16030,"cantly across his own throat. “I wouldn’t be here to discuss it,"
16031,"would I? I mean, I’m not saying that spell you used on Malfoy was"
16032,great —”
16033,"“Nor am I,” said Harry quickly."
16034,"“But he healed all right, didn’t he? Back on his feet in no time.”"
16035,"“Yeah,” said Harry; this was perfectly true, although his con-"
16036,science squirmed slightly all the same. “Thanks to Snape . . .”
16037,“You still got detention with Snape this Saturday?” Ron con-
16038,tinued.
16039,"“Yeah, and the Saturday after that, and the Saturday after that,”"
16040,sighed Harry. “And he’s hinting now that if I don’t get all the boxes
16041,"done by the end of term, we’ll carry on next year.”"
16042,He was finding these detentions particularly irksome because
16043,they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending
16044,"with Ginny. Indeed, he had frequently wondered lately whether"
16045,"Snape did not know this, for he was keeping Harry later and later"
16046,"every time, while making pointed asides about Harry having to"
16047,miss the good weather and the varied opportunities it offered.
16048,Harry was shaken from these bitter reflections by the appearance
16049, 539  
16050,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16051,"at his side of Jimmy Peakes, who was holding out a scroll of"
16052,parchment.
16053,"“Thanks, Jimmy . . . Hey, it’s from Dumbledore!” said Harry"
16054,"excitedly, unrolling the parchment and scanning it. “He wants me"
16055,to go to his office as quick as I can!”
16056,They stared at each other.
16057,"“Blimey,” whispered Ron. “You don’t reckon . . . he hasn’t"
16058,found . . . ?”
16059,"“Better go and see, hadn’t I?” said Harry, jumping to his feet."
16060,He hurried out of the common room and along the seventh
16061,"floor as fast as he could, passing nobody but Peeves, who swooped"
16062,"past in the opposite direction, throwing bits of chalk at Harry in a"
16063,routine sort of way and cackling loudly as he dodged Harry’s de-
16064,"fensive jinx. Once Peeves had vanished, there was silence in the"
16065,"corridors; with only fifteen minutes left until curfew, most people"
16066,had already returned to their common rooms.
16067,And then Harry heard a scream and a crash. He stopped in his
16068,"tracks, listening."
16069,“How — dare — you — aaaaargh!”
16070,The noise was coming from a corridor nearby; Harry sprinted
16071,"toward it, his wand at the ready, hurtled around another corner,"
16072,"and saw Professor Trelawney sprawled upon the floor, her head"
16073,"covered in one of her many shawls, several sherry bottles lying be-"
16074,"side her, one broken."
16075,“Professor —”
16076,Harry hurried forward and helped Professor Trelawney to her
16077,feet. Some of her glittering beads had become entangled with her
16078,"glasses. She hiccuped loudly, patted her hair, and pulled herself up"
16079,on Harry’s helping arm.
16080,  540   
16081,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16082,"“What happened, Professor?”"
16083,"“You may well ask!” she said shrilly. “I was strolling along, brood-"
16084,ing upon certain dark portents I happen to have glimpsed . . .”
16085,But Harry was not paying much attention. He had just noticed
16086,where they were standing: There on the right was the tapestry of
16087,"dancing trolls, and on the left, that smoothly impenetrable stretch"
16088,of stone wall that concealed —
16089,"“Professor, were you trying to get into the Room of Require-"
16090,ment?”
16091,“. . . omens I have been vouchsafed — what?” She looked sud-
16092,denly shifty.
16093,"“The Room of Requirement,” repeated Harry. “Were you trying"
16094,to get in there?”
16095,“I — well — I didn’t know students knew about —”
16096,"“Not all of them do,” said Harry. “But what happened? You"
16097,screamed. . . . It sounded as though you were hurt. . . .”
16098,"“I — well,” said Professor Trelawney, drawing her shawls around"
16099,her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified
16100,eyes. “I wished to — ah — deposit certain — um — personal items
16101,in the room. . . .” And she muttered something about “nasty accusa-
16102,tions.”
16103,"“Right,” said Harry, glancing down at the sherry bottles. “But"
16104,you couldn’t get in and hide them?”
16105,"He found this very odd; the room had opened for him, after all,"
16106,when he had wanted to hide the Half-Blood Prince’s book.
16107,"“Oh, I got in all right,” said Professor Trelawney, glaring at the"
16108,wall. “But there was somebody already in there.”
16109,“Somebody in — ? Who?” demanded Harry. “Who was in
16110,there?”
16111, 541   
16112,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16113,"“I have no idea,” said Professor Trelawney, looking slightly taken"
16114,aback at the urgency in Harry’s voice. “I walked into the room and
16115,"I heard a voice, which has never happened before in all my years of"
16116,"hiding — of using the room, I mean.”"
16117,“A voice? Saying what?”
16118,"“I don’t know that it was saying anything,” said Professor"
16119,Trelawney. “It was . . . whooping.”
16120,“Whooping?”
16121,"“Gleefully,” she said, nodding."
16122,Harry stared at her.
16123,“Was it male or female?”
16124,"“I would hazard a guess at male,” said Professor Trelawney."
16125,“And it sounded happy?”
16126,"“Very happy,” said Professor Trelawney sniffily."
16127,“As though it was celebrating?”
16128,“Most definitely.”
16129,“And then — ?”
16130,“And then I called out ‘Who’s there?’ ”
16131,“You couldn’t have found out who it was without asking?” Harry
16132,"asked her, slightly frustrated."
16133,"“The Inner Eye,” said Professor Trelawney with dignity, straight-"
16134,"ening her shawls and many strands of glittering beads, “was fixed"
16135,upon matters well outside the mundane realms of whooping
16136,voices.”
16137,"“Right,” said Harry hastily; he had heard about Professor"
16138,Trelawney’s Inner Eye all too often before. “And did the voice say
16139,who was there?”
16140,"“No, it did not,” she said. “Everything went pitch-black and the"
16141,"next thing I knew, I was being hurled headfirst out of the room!”"
16142, 542 
16143,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16144,"“And you didn’t see that coming?” said Harry, unable to help"
16145,himself.
16146,"“No, I did not, as I say, it was pitch —” She stopped and glared"
16147,at him suspiciously.
16148,"“I think you’d better tell Professor Dumbledore,” said Harry."
16149,"“He ought to know Malfoy’s celebrating — I mean, that someone"
16150,threw you out of the room.”
16151,"To his surprise, Professor Trelawney drew herself up at this sug-"
16152,"gestion, looking haughty."
16153,“The headmaster has intimated that he would prefer fewer visits
16154,"from me,” she said coldly. “I am not one to press my company"
16155,upon those who do not value it. If Dumbledore chooses to ignore
16156,the warnings the cards show —” Her bony hand closed suddenly
16157,"around Harry’s wrist. “Again and again, no matter how I lay them"
16158,out —” And she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her
16159,"shawls. “— the lightning-struck tower,” she whispered. “Calamity."
16160,Disaster. Coming nearer all the time . . .”
16161,"“Right,” said Harry again. “Well . . . I still think you should tell"
16162,"Dumbledore about this voice, and everything going dark and being"
16163,thrown out of the room. . . .”
16164,“You think so?” Professor Trelawney seemed to consider the
16165,"matter for a moment, but Harry could tell that she liked the idea"
16166,of retelling her little adventure.
16167,"“I’m going to see him right now,” said Harry. “I’ve got a meeting"
16168,with him. We could go together.”
16169,"“Oh, well, in that case,” said Professor Trelawney with a smile."
16170,"She bent down, scooped up her sherry bottles, and dumped them"
16171,unceremoniously in a large blue-and-white vase standing in a
16172,nearby niche.
16173,  543  
16174,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16175,"“I miss having you in my classes, Harry,” she said soulfully as"
16176,they set off together. “You were never much of a Seer . . . but you
16177,were a wonderful Object . . .”
16178,Harry did not reply; he had loathed being the Object of Profes-
16179,sor Trelawney’s continual predictions of doom.
16180,"“I am afraid,” she went on, “that the nag — I’m sorry, the cen-"
16181,taur — knows nothing of cartomancy. I asked him — one Seer to
16182,"another — had he not, too, sensed the distant vibrations of com-"
16183,"ing catastrophe? But he seemed to find me almost comical. Yes,"
16184,comical!”
16185,"Her voice rose rather hysterically, and Harry caught a powerful"
16186,whiff of sherry even though the bottles had been left behind.
16187,“Perhaps the horse has heard people say that I have not inherited
16188,my great-great-grandmother’s gift. Those rumors have been
16189,bandied about by the jealous for years. You know what I say to such
16190,"people, Harry? Would Dumbledore have let me teach at this great"
16191,"school, put so much trust in me all these years, had I not proved"
16192,myself to him?”
16193,Harry mumbled something indistinct.
16194,"“I well remember my first interview with Dumbledore,” went"
16195,"on Professor Trelawney, in throaty tones. “He was deeply im-"
16196,"pressed, of course, deeply impressed. . . . I was staying at the Hog’s"
16197,"Head, which I do not advise, incidentally — bedbugs, dear boy —"
16198,but funds were low. Dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling
16199,"upon me in my room. He questioned me. . . . I must confess that,"
16200,"at first, I thought he seemed ill-disposed toward Divination . . ."
16201,"and I remember I was starting to feel a little odd, I had not eaten"
16202,much that day . . . but then . . .”
16203,"And now Harry was paying attention properly for the first time,"
16204,  544  
16205,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16206,for he knew what had happened then: Professor Trelawney had
16207,"made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life, the"
16208,prophecy about him and Voldemort.
16209,“. . . but then we were rudely interrupted by Severus Snape!”
16210,“What?”
16211,"“Yes, there was a commotion outside the door and it flew open,"
16212,"and there was that rather uncouth barman standing with Snape,"
16213,"who was waffling about having come the wrong way up the stairs,"
16214,although I’m afraid that I myself rather thought he had been ap-
16215,prehended eavesdropping on my interview with Dumbledore —
16216,"you see, he himself was seeking a job at the time, and no doubt"
16217,"hoped to pick up tips! Well, after that, you know, Dumbledore"
16218,"seemed much more disposed to give me a job, and I could not help"
16219,"thinking, Harry, that it was because he appreciated the stark con-"
16220,"trast between my own unassuming manners and quiet talent, com-"
16221,"pared to the pushing, thrusting young man who was prepared to"
16222,"listen at keyholes — Harry, dear?”"
16223,"She looked back over her shoulder, having only just realized that"
16224,Harry was no longer with her; he had stopped walking and they
16225,were now ten feet from each other.
16226,“Harry?” she repeated uncertainly.
16227,Perhaps his face was white to make her look so concerned and
16228,frightened. Harry was standing stock-still as waves of shock
16229,"crashed over him, wave after wave, obliterating everything except"
16230,the information that had been kept from him for so long. . . .
16231,It was Snape who had overheard the prophecy. It was Snape who
16232,had carried the news of the prophecy to Voldemort. Snape and
16233,Peter Pettigrew together had sent Voldemort hunting after Lily and
16234,James and their son. . . .
16235, 545   
16236,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16237,Nothing else mattered to Harry just now.
16238,“Harry?” said Professor Trelawney again. “Harry — I thought
16239,we were going to see the headmaster together?”
16240,"“You stay here,” said Harry through numb lips."
16241,“But dear . . . I was going to tell him how I was assaulted in the
16242,Room of —”
16243,“You stay here!” Harry repeated angrily.
16244,"She looked alarmed as he ran past her, around the corner into"
16245,"Dumbledore’s corridor, where the lone gargoyle stood sentry."
16246,Harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving
16247,spiral staircase three steps at a time. He did not knock upon Dum-
16248,"bledore’s door, he hammered; and the calm voice answered, “En-"
16249,ter” after Harry had already flung himself into the room.
16250,"Fawkes the phoenix looked around, his bright black eyes gleam-"
16251,ing with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the windows.
16252,Dumbledore was standing at the window looking out at the
16253,"grounds, a long, black traveling cloak in his arms."
16254,"“Well, Harry, I promised that you could come with me.”"
16255,"For a moment or two, Harry did not understand; the conversa-"
16256,tion with Trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and
16257,his brain seemed to be moving very slowly.
16258,“Come . . . with you . . . ?”
16259,"“Only if you wish it, of course.”"
16260,“If I . . .”
16261,And then Harry remembered why he had been eager to come to
16262,Dumbledore’s office in the first place. “You’ve found one? You’ve
16263,found a Horcrux?”
16264,“I believe so.”
16265,  546  
16266,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16267,Rage and resentment fought shock and excitement: For several
16268,"moments, Harry could not speak."
16269,"“It is natural to be afraid,” said Dumbledore."
16270,"“I’m not scared!” said Harry at once, and it was perfectly true;"
16271,fear was one emotion he was not feeling at all. “Which Horcrux is
16272,it? Where is it?”
16273,“I am not sure which it is — though I think we can rule out the
16274,snake — but I believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many
16275,"miles from here, a cave I have been trying to locate for a very long"
16276,time: the cave in which Tom Riddle once terrorized two children
16277,from his orphanage on their annual trip; you remember?”
16278,"“Yes,” said Harry. “How is it protected?”"
16279,“I do not know; I have suspicions that may be entirely wrong.”
16280,"Dumbledore hesitated, then said, “Harry, I promised you that you"
16281,"could come with me, and I stand by that promise, but it would be"
16282,very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly
16283,dangerous.”
16284,"“I’m coming,” said Harry, almost before Dumbledore had fin-"
16285,"ished speaking. Boiling with anger at Snape, his desire to do some-"
16286,thing desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few
16287,"minutes. This seemed to show on Harry’s face, for Dumbledore"
16288,"moved away from the window and looked more closely at Harry, a"
16289,slight crease between his silver eyebrows.
16290,“What has happened to you?”
16291,"“Nothing,” lied Harry promptly."
16292,“What has upset you?”
16293,“I’m not upset.”
16294,"“Harry, you were never a good Occlumens —”"
16295, 547  
16296,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16297,The word was the spark that ignited Harry’s fury.
16298,"“Snape!” he said, very loudly, and Fawkes gave a soft squawk be-"
16299,hind them. “Snape’s what’s happened! He told Voldemort about
16300,"the prophecy, it was him, he listened outside the door, Trelawney"
16301,told me!”
16302,"Dumbledore’s expression did not change, but Harry thought his"
16303,face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun. For a
16304,"long moment, Dumbledore said nothing. “When did you find out"
16305,about this?” he asked at last.
16306,"“Just now!” said Harry, who was refraining from yelling with"
16307,"enormous difficulty. And then, suddenly, he could not stop him-"
16308,self. “AND YOU LET HIM TEACH HERE AND HE TOLD
16309,VOLDEMORT TO GO AFTER MY MUM AND DAD!”
16310,"Breathing hard as though he was fighting, Harry turned away"
16311,"from Dumbledore, who still had not moved a muscle, and paced"
16312,"up and down the study, rubbing his knuckles in his hand and exer-"
16313,cising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking things
16314,"over. He wanted to rage and storm at Dumbledore, but he also"
16315,wanted to go with him to try and destroy the Horcrux; he wanted
16316,"to tell him that he was a foolish old man for trusting Snape, but he"
16317,was terrified that Dumbledore would not take him along unless he
16318,mastered his anger. . . .
16319,"“Harry,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Please listen to me.”"
16320,It was as difficult to stop his relentless pacing as to refrain from
16321,"shouting. Harry paused, biting his lip, and looked into Dumble-"
16322,dore’s lined face.
16323,“Professor Snape made a terrible —”
16324,"“Don’t tell me it was a mistake, sir, he was listening at the door!”"
16325,“Please let me finish.” Dumbledore waited until Harry had
16326, 548   
16327,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16328,"nodded curtly, then went on. “Professor Snape made a terrible mis-"
16329,take. He was still in Lord Voldemort’s employ on the night he heard
16330,"the first half of Professor Trelawney’s prophecy. Naturally, he hastened"
16331,"to tell his master what he had heard, for it concerned his master most"
16332,deeply. But he did not know — he had no possible way of know-
16333,"ing — which boy Voldemort would hunt from then onward, or that"
16334,the parents he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that
16335,"Professor Snape knew, that they were your mother and father —”"
16336,Harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter.
16337,"“He hated my dad like he hated Sirius! Haven’t you noticed,"
16338,"Professor, how the people Snape hates tend to end up dead?”"
16339,“You have no idea of the remorse Professor Snape felt when he
16340,"realized how Lord Voldemort had interpreted the prophecy, Harry."
16341,I believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he
16342,returned —”
16343,"“But he’s a very good Occlumens, isn’t he, sir?” said Harry, whose"
16344,voice was shaking with the effort of keeping it steady. “And isn’t
16345,"Voldemort convinced that Snape’s on his side, even now? Professor"
16346,. . . how can you be sure Snape’s on our side?”
16347,Dumbledore did not speak for a moment; he looked as though
16348,he was trying to make up his mind about something. At last he
16349,"said, “I am sure. I trust Severus Snape completely.”"
16350,Harry breathed deeply for a few moments in an effort to steady
16351,himself. It did not work.
16352,"“Well, I don’t!” he said, as loudly as before. “He’s up to some-"
16353,"thing with Draco Malfoy right now, right under your nose, and you"
16354,still —”
16355,"“We have discussed this, Harry,” said Dumbledore, and now he"
16356,sounded stern again. “I have told you my views.”
16357, 549   
16358,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16359,"“You’re leaving the school tonight, and I’ll bet you haven’t even"
16360,considered that Snape and Malfoy might decide to —”
16361,"“To what?” asked Dumbledore, his eyebrows raised. “What is it"
16362,"that you suspect them of doing, precisely?”"
16363,"“I . . . they’re up to something!” said Harry, and his hands curled"
16364,into fists as he said it. “Professor Trelawney was just in the Room of
16365,"Requirement, trying to hide her sherry bottles, and she heard Mal-"
16366,"foy whooping, celebrating! He’s trying to mend something danger-"
16367,"ous in there and if you ask me, he’s fixed it at last and you’re about"
16368,to just walk out of school without —”
16369,"“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet"
16370,Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some
16371,invisible line. “Do you think that I have once left the school un-
16372,"protected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when"
16373,"I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do"
16374,"not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously,"
16375,Harry.”
16376,"“I didn’t —” mumbled Harry, a little abashed, but Dumbledore"
16377,cut across him.
16378,“I do not wish to discuss the matter any further.”
16379,"Harry bit back his retort, scared that he had gone too far, that he"
16380,"had ruined his chance of accompanying Dumbledore, but Dum-"
16381,"bledore went on, “Do you wish to come with me tonight?”"
16382,"“Yes,” said Harry at once."
16383,"“Very well, then: Listen.” Dumbledore drew himself up to his"
16384,full height. “I take you with me on one condition: that you obey
16385,"any command I might give you at once, and without question.”"
16386,“Of course.”
16387,"“Be sure to understand me, Harry. I mean that you must follow"
16388, 550   
16389,THE SEER OVERHEARD
16390,"even such orders as ‘run,’ ‘hide,’ or ‘go back.’ Do I have your"
16391,word?”
16392,"“I — yes, of course.”"
16393,"“If I tell you to hide, you will do so?”"
16394,“Yes.”
16395,"“If I tell you to flee, you will obey?”"
16396,“Yes.”
16397,"“If I tell you to leave me and save yourself, you will do as I tell"
16398,you?
16399,“I —”
16400,“Harry?”
16401,They looked at each other for a moment.
16402,"“Yes, sir.”"
16403,“Very good. Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility
16404,Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes’ time.”
16405,Dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window; the
16406,sun was now a ruby red glare along the horizon. Harry walked
16407,quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase. His mind was
16408,oddly clear all of a sudden. He knew what to do.
16409,Ron and Hermione were sitting together in the common room
16410,when he came back. “What does he want?” Hermione said at once.
16411,"“Harry, are you okay?” she added anxiously."
16412,"“I’m fine,” said Harry shortly, racing past them. He dashed up"
16413,"the stairs and into his dormitory, where he flung open his trunk"
16414,and pulled out the Marauder’s Map and a pair of balled-up socks.
16415,"Then he sped back down the stairs and into the common room,"
16416,"skidding to a halt where Ron and Hermione sat, looking stunned."
16417,"“I’ve got to be quick,” Harry panted. “Dumbledore thinks I’m"
16418,getting my Invisibility Cloak. Listen. . . .”
16419,  551  
16420,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
16421,Quickly he told them where he was going and why. He did not
16422,pause either for Hermione’s gasps of horror or for Ron’s hasty ques-
16423,tions; they could work out the finer details for themselves later.
16424,“. . . so you see what this means?” Harry finished at a gallop.
16425,"“Dumbledore won’t be here tonight, so Malfoy’s going to have an-"
16426,"other clear shot at whatever he’s up to. No, listen to me!” he hissed"
16427,"angrily, as both Ron and Hermione showed every sign of interrupt-"
16428,ing. “I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Require-
16429,ment. Here —” He shoved the Marauder’s Map into Hermione’s
16430,hands. “You’ve got to watch him and you’ve got to watch Snape too.
16431,"Use anyone else who you can rustle up from the D.A., Hermione,"
16432,"those contact Galleons will still work, right? Dumbledore says he’s"
16433,"put extra protection in the school, but if Snape’s involved, he’ll"
16434,"know what Dumbledore’s protection is, and how to avoid it — but"
16435,"he won’t be expecting you lot to be on the watch, will he?”"
16436,"“Harry —” began Hermione, her eyes huge with fear."
16437,"“I haven’t got time to argue,” said Harry curtly. “Take this as"
16438,well —”
16439,He thrust the socks into Ron’s hands.
16440,"“Thanks,” said Ron. “Er — why do I need socks?”"
16441,"“You need what’s wrapped in them, it’s the Felix Felicis. Share it"
16442,between yourselves and Ginny too. Say good-bye to her for me. I’d
16443,"better go, Dumbledore’s waiting —”"
16444,"“No!” said Hermione, as Ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of"
16445,"golden potion, looking awestruck. “We don’t want it, you take it,"
16446,who knows what you’re going to be facing?”
16447,"“I’ll be fine, I’ll be with Dumbledore,” said Harry. “I want to"
16448,"know you lot are okay. . . . Don’t look like that, Hermione, I’ll see"
16449,you later. . . .”

16452,"And he was off, hurrying back through the portrait hole and to-"
16453,ward the entrance hall.
16454,Dumbledore was waiting beside the oaken front doors. He
16455,"turned as Harry came skidding out onto the topmost stone step,"
16456,"panting hard, a searing stitch in his side."
16457,"“I would like you to wear your cloak, please,” said Dumbledore,"
16458,"and he waited until Harry had thrown it on before saying, “Very"
16459,good. Shall we go?”
16460,"Dumbledore set off at once down the stone steps, his own trav-"
16461,eling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air. Harry hurried
16462,"alongside him under the Invisibility Cloak, still panting and sweat-"
16463,ing rather a lot.
16464,"“But what will people think when they see you leaving, Profes-"
16465,"sor?” Harry asked, his mind on Malfoy and Snape."
16466,"“That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink,” said Dumbledore"
16467,"lightly. “I sometimes offer Rosmerta my custom, or else visit the"
16468,Hog’s Head . . . or I appear to. It is as good a way as any of dis-
16469,guising one’s true destination.”
16470,They made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight.
16471,"The air was full of the smells of warm grass, lake water, and wood"
16472,smoke from Hagrid’s cabin. It was difficult to believe that they
16473,were heading for anything dangerous or frightening.
16474,"“Professor,” said Harry quietly, as the gates at the bottom of the"
16475,"drive came into view, “will we be Apparating?”"
16476,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “You can Apparate now, I believe?”"
16477,"“Yes,” said Harry, “but I haven’t got a license.”"
16478,He felt it best to be honest; what if he spoiled everything by
16479,turning up a hundred miles from where he was supposed to go?
16480,"“No matter,” said Dumbledore, “I can assist you again.”"

16483,"They turned out of the gates into the twilit, deserted lane to"
16484,"Hogsmeade. Darkness descended fast as they walked, and by the"
16485,time they reached the High Street night was falling in earnest.
16486,Lights twinkled from windows over shops and as they neared the
16487,Three Broomsticks they heard raucous shouting.
16488,"“— and stay out!” shouted Madam Rosmerta, forcibly ejecting a"
16489,"grubby-looking wizard. “Oh, hello, Albus . . . You’re out late . . .”"
16490,"“Good evening, Rosmerta, good evening . . . forgive me, I’m off"
16491,"to the Hog’s Head. . . . No offense, but I feel like a quieter atmo-"
16492,sphere tonight. . . .”
16493,A minute later they turned the corner into the side street where
16494,"the Hog’s Head’s sign creaked a little, though there was no breeze."
16495,"In contrast to the Three Broomsticks, the pub appeared to be com-"
16496,pletely empty.
16497,"“It will not be necessary for us to enter,” muttered Dumbledore,"
16498,glancing around. “As long as nobody sees us go . . . now place your
16499,"hand upon my arm, Harry. There is no need to grip too hard, I am"
16500,merely guiding you. On the count of three . . . One . . . two . . .
16501,three . . .”
16502,"Harry turned. At once, there was that horrible sensation that he"
16503,was being squeezed through a thick rubber tube; he could not draw
16504,"breath, every part of him was being compressed almost past en-"
16505,"durance and then, just when he thought he must suffocate, the in-"
16506,"visible bands seemed to burst open, and he was standing in cool"
16507,"darkness, breathing in lungfuls of fresh, salty air."

16510,THE CAVE
16511,"H          arry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light,"
16512,chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moon-
16513,lit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of
16514,"dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced"
16515,"over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop,"
16516,"black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one"
16517,"upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as"
16518,though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in
16519,"the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved"
16520,by any tree or sweep of grass or sand.
16521,“What do you think?” asked Dumbledore. He might have been
16522,asking Harry’s opinion on whether it was a good site for a picnic.
16523,"“They brought the kids from the orphanage here?” asked Harry,"
16524,who could not imagine a less cozy spot for a day trip.
16525,"“Not here, precisely,” said Dumbledore. “There is a village of"
16526,sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us. I believe the orphans
16527, 555   
16528,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16529,"were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves. No, I"
16530,think it was only ever Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who
16531,visited this spot. No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were
16532,"uncommonly good mountaineers, and boats cannot approach the"
16533,"cliffs, the waters around them are too dangerous. I imagine that"
16534,Riddle climbed down; magic would have served better than ropes.
16535,"And he brought two small children with him, probably for the"
16536,pleasure of terrorizing them. I think the journey alone would have
16537,"done it, don’t you?”"
16538,Harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bumps.
16539,“But his final destination — and ours — lies a little farther on.
16540,Come.”
16541,Dumbledore beckoned Harry to the very edge of the rock where
16542,a series of jagged niches made footholds leading down to boulders
16543,that lay half-submerged in water and closer to the cliff. It was a
16544,"treacherous descent and Dumbledore, hampered slightly by his"
16545,"withered hand, moved slowly. The lower rocks were slippery with"
16546,seawater. Harry could feel flecks of cold salt spray hitting his face.
16547,"“Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to"
16548,the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the
16549,dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the
16550,black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too.
16551,"“You see?” said Dumbledore quietly, holding his wand a little"
16552,higher. Harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water was
16553,swirling.
16554,“You will not object to getting a little wet?”
16555,"“No,” said Harry."
16556,“Then take off your Invisibility Cloak — there is no need for it
16557,now — and let us take the plunge.”
16558, 556   
16559,THE CAVE
16560,"And with the sudden agility of a much younger man, Dumble-"
16561,"dore slid from the boulder, landed in the sea, and began to swim,"
16562,"with a perfect breaststroke, toward the dark slit in the rock face, his"
16563,"lit wand held in his teeth. Harry pulled off his cloak, stuffed it into"
16564,"his pocket, and followed."
16565,The water was icy; Harry’s waterlogged clothes billowed around
16566,him and weighed him down. Taking deep breaths that filled his
16567,"nostrils with the tang of salt and seaweed, he struck out for the"
16568,"shimmering, shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff."
16569,The fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that Harry could tell
16570,would be filled with water at high tide. The slimy walls were barely
16571,three feet apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of
16572,"Dumbledore’s wand. A little way in, the passageway curved to the"
16573,"left, and Harry saw that it extended far into the cliff. He continued"
16574,"to swim in Dumbledore’s wake, the tips of his benumbed fingers"
16575,"brushing the rough, wet rock."
16576,"Then he saw Dumbledore rising out of the water ahead, his sil-"
16577,ver hair and dark robes gleaming. When Harry reached the spot
16578,"he found steps that led into a large cave. He clambered up them,"
16579,"water streaming from his soaking clothes, and emerged, shivering"
16580,"uncontrollably, into the still and freezing air."
16581,"Dumbledore was standing in the middle of the cave, his wand"
16582,"held high as he turned slowly on the spot, examining the walls and"
16583,ceiling.
16584,"“Yes, this is the place,” said Dumbledore."
16585,“How can you tell?” Harry spoke in a whisper.
16586,"“It has known magic,” said Dumbledore simply."
16587,Harry could not tell whether the shivers he was experiencing
16588,were due to his spine-deep coldness or to the same awareness of
16589, 557 
16590,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16591,enchantments. He watched as Dumbledore continued to revolve
16592,"on the spot, evidently concentrating on things Harry could not see."
16593,"“This is merely the antechamber, the entrance hall,” said Dum-"
16594,bledore after a moment or two. “We need to penetrate the inner
16595,place. . . . Now it is Lord Voldemort’s obstacles that stand in our
16596,"way, rather than those nature made. . . .”"
16597,Dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it
16598,"with his blackened fingertips, murmuring words in a strange"
16599,tongue that Harry did not understand. Twice Dumbledore walked
16600,"right around the cave, touching as much of the rough rock as he"
16601,"could, occasionally pausing, running his fingers backward and for-"
16602,"ward over a particular spot, until finally he stopped, his hand"
16603,pressed flat against the wall.
16604,"“Here,” he said. “We go on through here. The entrance is con-"
16605,cealed.”
16606,Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a
16607,"wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching;"
16608,but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more
16609,often the marks of ineptitude than expertise.
16610,Dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his
16611,"wand at the rock. For a moment, an arched outline appeared there,"
16612,blazing white as though there was a powerful light behind the
16613,crack.
16614,"“You’ve d-done it!” said Harry through chattering teeth, but be-"
16615,"fore the words had left his lips the outline had gone, leaving the"
16616,rock as bare and solid as ever. Dumbledore looked around.
16617,"“Harry, I’m so sorry, I forgot,” he said; he now pointed his wand"
16618,"at Harry and at once, Harry’s clothes were as warm and dry as if"
16619,they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire.
16620, 558  
16621,THE CAVE
16622,"“Thank you,” said Harry gratefully, but Dumbledore had al-"
16623,ready turned his attention back to the solid cave wall. He did not
16624,"try any more magic, but simply stood there staring at it intently, as"
16625,though something extremely interesting was written on it. Harry
16626,stayed quite still; he did not want to break Dumbledore’s concen-
16627,"tration. Then, after two solid minutes, Dumbledore said quietly,"
16628,"“Oh, surely not. So crude.”"
16629,"“What is it, Professor?”"
16630,"“I rather think,” said Dumbledore, putting his uninjured hand"
16631,inside his robes and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind
16632,"Harry used to chop potion ingredients, “that we are required to"
16633,make payment to pass.”
16634,“Payment?” said Harry. “You’ve got to give the door something?”
16635,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “Blood, if I am not much mistaken.”"
16636,“Blood?”
16637,"“I said it was crude,” said Dumbledore, who sounded disdainful,"
16638,"even disappointed, as though Voldemort had fallen short of the"
16639,"standards Dumbledore expected. “The idea, as I am sure you will"
16640,"have gathered, is that your enemy must weaken him- or herself to"
16641,"enter. Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are"
16642,much more terrible things than physical injury.”
16643,"“Yeah, but still, if you can avoid it . . .” said Harry, who had ex-"
16644,perienced enough pain not to be keen for more.
16645,"“Sometimes, however, it is unavoidable,” said Dumbledore,"
16646,shaking back the sleeve of his robes and exposing the forearm of his
16647,injured hand.
16648,"“Professor!” protested Harry, hurrying forward as Dumbledore"
16649,"raised his knife. “I’ll do it, I’m —”"
16650,"He did not know what he was going to say — younger, fitter?"
16651, 559 
16652,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16653,"But Dumbledore merely smiled. There was a flash of silver, and a"
16654,"spurt of scarlet; the rock face was peppered with dark, glistening"
16655,drops.
16656,"“You are very kind, Harry,” said Dumbledore, now passing the"
16657,"tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm, so"
16658,"that it healed instantly, just as Snape had healed Malfoy’s wounds."
16659,"“But your blood is worth more than mine. Ah, that seems to have"
16660,"done the trick, doesn’t it?”"
16661,The blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall
16662,"once more, and this time it did not fade away: The blood-spattered"
16663,"rock within it simply vanished, leaving an opening into what"
16664,seemed total darkness.
16665,"“After me, I think,” said Dumbledore, and he walked through"
16666,"the archway with Harry on his heels, lighting his own wand hastily"
16667,as he went.
16668,An eerie sight met their eyes: They were standing on the edge of
16669,"a great black lake, so vast that Harry could not make out the dis-"
16670,"tant banks, in a cavern so high that the ceiling too was out of sight."
16671,A misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the mid-
16672,dle of the lake; it was reflected in the completely still water below.
16673,The greenish glow and the light from the two wands were the only
16674,"things that broke the otherwise velvety blackness, though their rays"
16675,did not penetrate as far as Harry would have expected. The dark-
16676,ness was somehow denser than normal darkness.
16677,"“Let us walk,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Be very careful not to"
16678,step into the water. Stay close to me.”
16679,"He set off around the edge of the lake, and Harry followed close"
16680,"behind him. Their footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds on the"
16681,narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water. On and on they
16682, 560  
16683,THE CAVE
16684,"walked, but the view did not vary: on one side of them, the rough"
16685,"cavern wall, on the other, the boundless expanse of smooth, glassy"
16686,"blackness, in the very middle of which was that mysterious greenish"
16687,"glow. Harry found the place and the silence oppressive, unnerving."
16688,“Professor?” he said finally. “Do you think the Horcrux is here?”
16689,"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore. “Yes, I’m sure it is. The question is,"
16690,how do we get to it?”
16691,“We couldn’t . . . we couldn’t just try a Summoning Charm?”
16692,"Harry said, sure that it was a stupid suggestion. But he was much"
16693,keener than he was prepared to admit on getting out of this place
16694,as soon as possible.
16695,"“Certainly we could,” said Dumbledore, stopping so suddenly"
16696,that Harry almost walked into him. “Why don’t you do it?”
16697,“Me? Oh . . . okay . . .”
16698,"Harry had not expected this, but cleared his throat and said"
16699,"loudly, wand aloft, “Accio Horcrux!”"
16700,"With a noise like an explosion, something very large and pale"
16701,erupted out of the dark water some twenty feet away; before Harry
16702,"could see what it was, it had vanished again with a crashing splash"
16703,"that made great, deep ripples on the mirrored surface. Harry leapt"
16704,backward in shock and hit the wall; his heart was still thundering as
16705,he turned to Dumbledore.
16706,“What was that?”
16707,"“Something, I think, that is ready to respond should we attempt"
16708,to seize the Horcrux.”
16709,Harry looked back at the water. The surface of the lake was once
16710,more shining black glass: The ripples had vanished unnaturally
16711,"fast; Harry’s heart, however, was still pounding."
16712,"“Did you think that would happen, sir?”"
16713,  561  
16714,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16715,“I thought something would happen if we made an obvious at-
16716,"tempt to get our hands on the Horcrux. That was a very good idea,"
16717,Harry; much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing.”
16718,"“But we don’t know what the thing was,” said Harry, looking at"
16719,the sinisterly smooth water.
16720,"“What the things are, you mean,” said Dumbledore. “I doubt"
16721,very much that there is only one of them. Shall we walk on?”
16722,“Professor?”
16723,"“Yes, Harry?”"
16724,“Do you think we’re going to have to go into the lake?”
16725,“Into it? Only if we are very unfortunate.”
16726,“You don’t think the Horcrux is at the bottom?”
16727,“Oh no . . . I think the Horcrux is in the middle.”
16728,And Dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the
16729,center of the lake.
16730,“So we’re going to have to cross the lake to get to it?”
16731,"“Yes, I think so.”"
16732,Harry did not say anything. His thoughts were all of water mon-
16733,"sters, of giant serpents, of demons, kelpies, and sprites. . . ."
16734,"“Aha,” said Dumbledore, and he stopped again; this time, Harry"
16735,really did walk into him; for a moment he toppled on the edge of
16736,"the dark water, and Dumbledore’s uninjured hand closed tightly"
16737,"around his upper arm, pulling him back. “So sorry, Harry, I should"
16738,"have given warning. Stand back against the wall, please; I think I"
16739,have found the place.”
16740,Harry had no idea what Dumbledore meant; this patch of dark
16741,"bank was exactly like every other bit as far as he could tell, but"
16742,Dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it.
16743,"This time he was running his hand, not over the rocky wall, but"
16744, 562  
16745,THE CAVE
16746,"through the thin air, as though expecting to find and grip some-"
16747,thing invisible.
16748,"“Oho,” said Dumbledore happily, seconds later. His hand had"
16749,closed in midair upon something Harry could not see. Dumble-
16750,dore moved closer to the water; Harry watched nervously as the
16751,tips of Dumbledore’s buckled shoes found the utmost edge of the
16752,"rock rim. Keeping his hand clenched in midair, Dumbledore raised"
16753,his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point.
16754,Immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin
16755,"air, extending from the depths of the water into Dumbledore’s"
16756,"clenched hand. Dumbledore tapped the chain, which began to"
16757,"slide through his fist like a snake, coiling itself on the ground with"
16758,"a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky walls, pulling"
16759,something from the depths of the black water. Harry gasped as the
16760,"ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface, glowing as green as"
16761,"the chain, and floated, with barely a ripple, toward the place on the"
16762,bank where Harry and Dumbledore stood.
16763,“How did you know that was there?” Harry asked in astonish-
16764,ment.
16765,"“Magic always leaves traces,” said Dumbledore, as the boat hit"
16766,"the bank with a gentle bump, “sometimes very distinctive traces. I"
16767,taught Tom Riddle. I know his style.”
16768,“Is . . . is this boat safe?”
16769,"“Oh yes, I think so. Voldemort needed to create a means to"
16770,cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creatures he
16771,had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his
16772,Horcrux.”
16773,“So the things in the water won’t do anything to us if we cross in
16774,Voldemort’s boat?”
16775, 563 
16776,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16777,"“I think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will, at"
16778,"some point, realize we are not Lord Voldemort. Thus far, however,"
16779,we have done well. They have allowed us to raise the boat.”
16780,"“But why have they let us?” asked Harry, who could not shake"
16781,off the vision of tentacles rising out of the dark water the moment
16782,they were out of sight of the bank.
16783,“Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none
16784,"but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat,” said"
16785,Dumbledore. “I think he would have been prepared to risk what
16786,"was, to his mind, the most unlikely possibility that somebody else"
16787,"would find it, knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that"
16788,only he would be able to penetrate. We shall see whether he is
16789,right.”
16790,Harry looked down into the boat. It really was very small.
16791,“It doesn’t look like it was built for two people. Will it hold both
16792,of us? Will we be too heavy together?”
16793,Dumbledore chuckled.
16794,"“Voldemort will not have cared about the weight, but about the"
16795,amount of magical power that crossed his lake. I rather think an
16796,enchantment will have been placed upon this boat so that only one
16797,wizard at a time will be able to sail in it.”
16798,“But then — ?”
16799,"“I do not think you will count, Harry: You are underage and un-"
16800,qualified. Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old
16801,to reach this place: I think it unlikely that your powers will register
16802,compared to mine.”
16803,These words did nothing to raise Harry’s morale; perhaps
16804,"Dumbledore knew it, for he added, “Voldemort’s mistake, Harry,"
16805,Voldemort’s mistake . . . Age is foolish and forgetful when it
16806, 564   
16807,THE CAVE
16808,"underestimates youth. . . . Now, you first this time, and be careful"
16809,not to touch the water.”
16810,Dumbledore stood aside and Harry climbed carefully into the
16811,"boat. Dumbledore stepped in too, coiling the chain onto the floor."
16812,"They were crammed in together; Harry could not comfortably sit,"
16813,"but crouched, his knees jutting over the edge of the boat, which be-"
16814,gan to move at once. There was no sound other than the silken rus-
16815,tle of the boat’s prow cleaving the water; it moved without their
16816,"help, as though an invisible rope was pulling it onward toward the"
16817,light in the center. Soon they could no longer see the walls of the
16818,cavern; they might have been at sea except that there were no
16819,waves.
16820,Harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight
16821,sparkling and glittering on the black water as they passed. The boat
16822,"was carving deep ripples upon the glassy surface, grooves in the"
16823,dark mirror. . . .
16824,"And then Harry saw it, marble white, floating inches below the"
16825,surface.
16826,"“Professor!” he said, and his startled voice echoed loudly over the"
16827,silent water.
16828,“Harry?”
16829,“I think I saw a hand in the water — a human hand!”
16830,"“Yes, I am sure you did,” said Dumbledore calmly."
16831,"Harry stared down into the water, looking for the vanished"
16832,"hand, and a sick feeling rose in his throat."
16833,“So that thing that jumped out of the water — ?”
16834,But Harry had his answer before Dumbledore could reply; the
16835,"wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him, this"
16836,"time, a dead man lying faceup inches beneath the surface, his open"
16837,  565    
16838,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16839,"eyes misted as though with cobwebs, his hair and his robes swirling"
16840,around him like smoke.
16841,"“There are bodies in here!” said Harry, and his voice sounded"
16842,much higher than usual and most unlike his own.
16843,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore placidly, “but we do not need to worry"
16844,about them at the moment.”
16845,"“At the moment?” Harry repeated, tearing his gaze from the wa-"
16846,ter to look at Dumbledore.
16847,"“Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us,” said"
16848,"Dumbledore. “There is nothing to be feared from a body, Harry,"
16849,any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness.
16850,"Lord Voldemort, who of course secretly fears both, disagrees. But"
16851,once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom. It is the unknown we
16852,"fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.”"
16853,"Harry said nothing; he did not want to argue, but he found the"
16854,idea that there were bodies floating around them and beneath them
16855,"horrible and, what was more, he did not believe that they were not"
16856,dangerous.
16857,"“But one of them jumped,” he said, trying to make his voice as"
16858,level and calm as Dumbledore’s. “When I tried to Summon the
16859,"Horcrux, a body leapt out of the lake.”"
16860,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “I am sure that once we take the"
16861,"Horcrux, we shall find them less peaceable. However, like many"
16862,"creatures that dwell in cold and darkness, they fear light and"
16863,"warmth, which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need"
16864,"arise. Fire, Harry,” Dumbledore added with a smile, in response to"
16865,Harry’s bewildered expression.
16866,“Oh . . . right . . .” said Harry quickly. He turned his head to
16867,look at the greenish glow toward which the boat was still inexorably
16868, 566  
16869,THE CAVE
16870,sailing. He could not pretend now that he was not scared. The great
16871,"black lake, teeming with the dead . . . It seemed hours and hours"
16872,"ago that he had met Professor Trelawney, that he had given Ron"
16873,and Hermione Felix Felicis. . . . He suddenly wished he had said a
16874,better good-bye to them . . . and he hadn’t seen Ginny at all. . . .
16875,"“Nearly there,” said Dumbledore cheerfully."
16876,"Sure enough, the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at"
16877,"last, and within minutes, the boat had come to a halt, bumping"
16878,"gently into something that Harry could not see at first, but when"
16879,he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small
16880,island of smooth rock in the center of the lake.
16881,"“Careful not to touch the water,” said Dumbledore again as"
16882,Harry climbed out of the boat.
16883,"The island was no larger than Dumbledore’s office, an expanse"
16884,of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that
16885,"greenish light, which looked much brighter when viewed close to."
16886,"Harry squinted at it; at first, he thought it was a lamp of some"
16887,"kind, but then he saw that the light was coming from a stone basin"
16888,"rather like the Pensieve, which was set on top of a pedestal."
16889,Dumbledore approached the basin and Harry followed. Side by
16890,"side, they looked down into it. The basin was full of an emerald liq-"
16891,uid emitting that phosphorescent glow.
16892,“What is it?” asked Harry quietly.
16893,"“I am not sure,” said Dumbledore. “Something more worrisome"
16894,"than blood and bodies, however.”"
16895,Dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his black-
16896,"ened hand, and stretched out the tips of his burned fingers toward"
16897,the surface of the potion.
16898,"“Sir, no, don’t touch — !”"
16899, 567  
16900,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16901,"“I cannot touch,” said Dumbledore, smiling faintly. “See? I can-"
16902,not approach any nearer than this. You try.”
16903,"Staring, Harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to"
16904,touch the potion. He met an invisible barrier that prevented him
16905,"coming within an inch of it. No matter how hard he pushed, his"
16906,fingers encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and in-
16907,flexible air.
16908,"“Out of the way, please, Harry,” said Dumbledore. He raised his"
16909,wand and made complicated movements over the surface of the
16910,"potion, murmuring soundlessly. Nothing happened, except per-"
16911,haps that the potion glowed a little brighter. Harry remained silent
16912,"while Dumbledore worked, but after a while Dumbledore with-"
16913,"drew his wand, and Harry felt it was safe to talk again."
16914,"“You think the Horcrux is in there, sir?”"
16915,“Oh yes.” Dumbledore peered more closely into the basin.
16916,"Harry saw his face reflected, upside down, in the smooth surface of"
16917,the green potion. “But how to reach it? This potion cannot be pen-
16918,"etrated by hand, Vanished, parted, scooped up, or siphoned away,"
16919,"nor can it be Transfigured, Charmed, or otherwise made to change"
16920,its nature.”
16921,"Almost absentmindedly, Dumbledore raised his wand again,"
16922,"twirled it once in midair, and then caught the crystal goblet that he"
16923,had conjured out of nowhere.
16924,“I can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk.”
16925,“What?” said Harry. “No!”
16926,"“Yes, I think so: Only by drinking it can I empty the basin and"
16927,see what lies in its depths.”
16928,“But what if — what if it kills you?”
16929,"“Oh, I doubt that it would work like that,” said Dumbledore"
16930,  568  
16931,THE CAVE
16932,easily. “Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who
16933,reached this island.”
16934,Harry couldn’t believe it. Was this more of Dumbledore’s insane
16935,determination to see good in everyone?
16936,"“Sir,” said Harry, trying to keep his voice reasonable, “sir, this is"
16937,Voldemort we’re —”
16938,"“I’m sorry, Harry; I should have said, he would not want to im-"
16939,"mediately kill the person who reached this island,” Dumbledore"
16940,corrected himself. “He would want to keep them alive long enough
16941,to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his de-
16942,"fenses and, most importantly of all, why they were so intent upon"
16943,emptying the basin. Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes
16944,that he alone knows about his Horcruxes.”
16945,"Harry made to speak again, but this time Dumbledore raised his"
16946,"hand for silence, frowning slightly at the emerald liquid, evidently"
16947,thinking hard.
16948,"“Undoubtedly,” he said, finally, “this potion must act in a way"
16949,"that will prevent me taking the Horcrux. It might paralyze me,"
16950,"cause me to forget what I am here for, create so much pain I am dis-"
16951,"tracted, or render me incapable in some other way. This being"
16952,"the case, Harry, it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking,"
16953,even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth. You
16954,understand?”
16955,"Their eyes met over the basin, each pale face lit with that strange,"
16956,green light. Harry did not speak. Was this why he had been invited
16957,along — so that he could force-feed Dumbledore a potion that
16958,might cause him unendurable pain?
16959,"“You remember,” said Dumbledore, “the condition on which I"
16960,brought you with me?”
16961, 569  
16962,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16963,"Harry hesitated, looking into the blue eyes that had turned"
16964,green in the reflected light of the basin.
16965,“But what if — ?”
16966,"“You swore, did you not, to follow any command I gave you?”"
16967,"“Yes, but —”"
16968,"“I warned you, did I not, that there might be danger?”"
16969,"“Yes,” said Harry, “but —”"
16970,"“Well, then,” said Dumbledore, shaking back his sleeves once"
16971,"more and raising the empty goblet, “you have my orders.”"
16972,“Why can’t I drink the potion instead?” asked Harry desperately.
16973,"“Because I am much older, much cleverer, and much less"
16974,"valuable,” said Dumbledore. “Once and for all, Harry, do I have"
16975,your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep
16976,drinking?”
16977,“Couldn’t — ?”
16978,“Do I have it?”
16979,“But —”
16980,"“Your word, Harry.”"
16981,"“I — all right, but —”"
16982,"Before Harry could make any further protest, Dumbledore low-"
16983,"ered the crystal goblet into the potion. For a split second, Harry"
16984,hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the gob-
16985,"let, but the crystal sank into the surface as nothing else had; when"
16986,"the glass was full to the brim, Dumbledore lifted it to his mouth."
16987,"“Your good health, Harry.”"
16988,"And he drained the goblet. Harry watched, terrified, his hands"
16989,gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertips were numb.
16990,"“Professor?” he said anxiously, as Dumbledore lowered the"
16991,empty glass. “How do you feel?”
16992, 570   
16993,THE CAVE
16994,"Dumbledore shook his head, his eyes closed. Harry wondered"
16995,whether he was in pain. Dumbledore plunged the glass blindly
16996,"back into the basin, refilled it, and drank once more."
16997,"In silence, Dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion."
16998,"Then, halfway through the fourth goblet, he staggered and fell for-"
16999,"ward against the basin. His eyes were still closed, his breathing"
17000,heavy.
17001,"“Professor Dumbledore?” said Harry, his voice strained. “Can"
17002,you hear me?”
17003,Dumbledore did not answer. His face was twitching as though he
17004,"was deeply asleep, but dreaming a horrible dream. His grip on the"
17005,goblet was slackening; the potion was about to spill from it. Harry
17006,"reached forward and grasped the crystal cup, holding it steady."
17007,"“Professor, can you hear me?” he repeated loudly, his voice echo-"
17008,ing around the cavern.
17009,Dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice Harry did not
17010,"recognize, for he had never heard Dumbledore frightened like this."
17011,“I don’t want . . . Don’t make me . . .”
17012,"Harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well, at the"
17013,"crooked nose and half-moon spectacles, and did not know what"
17014,to do.
17015,“. . . don’t like . . . want to stop . . .” moaned Dumbledore.
17016,"“You . . . you can’t stop, Professor,” said Harry. “You’ve got to"
17017,"keep drinking, remember? You told me you had to keep drinking."
17018,Here . . .”
17019,"Hating himself, repulsed by what he was doing, Harry forced"
17020,"the goblet back toward Dumbledore’s mouth and tipped it, so that"
17021,Dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside.
17022,"“No . . .” he groaned, as Harry lowered the goblet back into the"
17023, 571   
17024,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
17025,basin and refilled it for him. “I don’t want to. . . . I don’t want to.
17026,. . . Let me go. . . .”
17027,"“It’s all right, Professor,” said Harry, his hand shaking. “It’s all"
17028,"right, I’m here —”"
17029,"“Make it stop, make it stop,” moaned Dumbledore."
17030,"“Yes . . . yes, this’ll make it stop,” lied Harry. He tipped the con-"
17031,tents of the goblet into Dumbledore’s open mouth.
17032,Dumbledore screamed; the noise echoed all around the vast
17033,"chamber, across the dead black water."
17034,"“No, no, no, no, I can’t, I can’t, don’t make me, I don’t want"
17035,to. . . .”
17036,"“It’s all right, Professor, it’s all right!” said Harry loudly, his"
17037,hands shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth goblet-
17038,ful of potion; the basin was now half empty. “Nothing’s happening
17039,"to you, you’re safe, it isn’t real, I swear it isn’t real — take this, now,"
17040,take this. . . .”
17041,"And obediently, Dumbledore drank, as though it was an anti-"
17042,"dote Harry offered him, but upon draining the goblet, he sank to"
17043,"his knees, shaking uncontrollably."
17044,"“It’s all my fault, all my fault,” he sobbed. “Please make it stop,"
17045,"I know I did wrong, oh please make it stop and I’ll never, never"
17046,again . . .”
17047,"“This will make it stop, Professor,” Harry said, his voice crack-"
17048,ing as he tipped the seventh glass of potion into Dumbledore’s
17049,mouth.
17050,Dumbledore began to cower as though invisible torturers sur-
17051,rounded him; his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet
17052,"from Harry’s trembling hands as he moaned, “Don’t hurt them,"
17053,"don’t hurt them, please, please, it’s my fault, hurt me instead . . .”"
17054, 572   
17055,THE CAVE
17056,"“Here, drink this, drink this, you’ll be all right,” said Harry des-"
17057,"perately, and once again Dumbledore obeyed him, opening his"
17058,mouth even as he kept his eyes tight shut and shook from head to
17059,foot.
17060,"And now he fell forward, screaming again, hammering his fists"
17061,"upon the ground, while Harry filled the ninth goblet."
17062,"“Please, please, please, no . . . not that, not that, I’ll do any-"
17063,thing . . .”
17064,"“Just drink, Professor, just drink . . .”"
17065,"Dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst, but when he had"
17066,"finished, he yelled again as though his insides were on fire. “No"
17067,"more, please, no more . . .”"
17068,Harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal
17069,scrape the bottom of the basin.
17070,"“We’re nearly there, Professor. Drink this, drink it. . . .”"
17071,"He supported Dumbledore’s shoulders and again, Dumbledore"
17072,"drained the glass; then Harry was on his feet once more, refilling"
17073,the goblet as Dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than
17074,"ever, “I want to die! I want to die! Make it stop, make it stop, I want"
17075,to die!”
17076,"“Drink this, Professor. Drink this. . . .”"
17077,"Dumbledore drank, and no sooner had he finished than he"
17078,"yelled, “KILL ME!”"
17079,“This — this one will!” gasped Harry. “Just drink this . . . It’ll
17080,be over . . . all over!”
17081,"Dumbledore gulped at the goblet, drained every last drop, and"
17082,"then, with a great, rattling gasp, rolled over onto his face."
17083,"“No!” shouted Harry, who had stood to refill the goblet again;"
17084,"instead he dropped the cup into the basin, flung himself down"
17085, 573    
17086,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
17087,"beside Dumbledore, and heaved him over onto his back; Dumble-"
17088,"dore’s glasses were askew, his mouth agape, his eyes closed. “No,”"
17089,"said Harry, shaking Dumbledore, “no, you’re not dead, you said it"
17090,"wasn’t poison, wake up, wake up — Rennervate!” he cried, his"
17091,wand pointing at Dumbledore’s chest; there was a flash of red light
17092,but nothing happened. “Rennervate — sir — please —”
17093,Dumbledore’s eyelids flickered; Harry’s heart leapt.
17094,"“Sir, are you — ?”"
17095,"“Water,” croaked Dumbledore."
17096,"“Water,” panted Harry. “Yes —”"
17097,He leapt to his feet and seized the goblet he had dropped in the
17098,basin; he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it.
17099,"“Aguamenti!” he shouted, jabbing the goblet with his wand."
17100,The goblet filled with clear water; Harry dropped to his knees
17101,"beside Dumbledore, raised his head, and brought the glass to his"
17102,lips — but it was empty. Dumbledore groaned and began to pant.
17103,"“But I had some — wait — Aguamenti!” said Harry again,"
17104,"pointing his wand at the goblet. Once more, for a second, clear wa-"
17105,"ter gleamed within it, but as he approached Dumbledore’s mouth,"
17106,the water vanished again.
17107,"“Sir, I’m trying, I’m trying!” said Harry desperately, but he did"
17108,not think that Dumbledore could hear him; he had rolled onto his
17109,"side and was drawing great, rattling breaths that sounded agoniz-"
17110,ing. “Aguamenti — Aguamenti — AGUAMENTI !”
17111,The goblet filled and emptied once more. And now Dumble-
17112,"dore’s breathing was fading. His brain whirling in panic, Harry"
17113,"knew, instinctively, the only way left to get water, because Volde-"
17114,mort had planned it so . . .
17115,He flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the
17116, 574  
17117,THE CAVE
17118,"goblet into the lake, bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that"
17119,did not vanish.
17120,"“Sir — here!” Harry yelled, and lunging forward, he tipped the"
17121,water clumsily over Dumbledore’s face.
17122,"It was the best he could do, for the icy feeling on his arm not"
17123,holding the cup was not the lingering chill of the water. A slimy
17124,"white hand had gripped his wrist, and the creature to whom it be-"
17125,"longed was pulling him, slowly, backward across the rock. The sur-"
17126,"face of the lake was no longer mirror-smooth; it was churning, and"
17127,"everywhere Harry looked, white heads and hands were emerging"
17128,"from the dark water, men and women and children with sunken,"
17129,sightless eyes were moving toward the rock: an army of the dead
17130,rising from the black water.
17131,"“Petrificus Totalus!” yelled Harry, struggling to cling to the"
17132,"smooth, soaked surface of the island as he pointed his wand at"
17133,"the Inferius that had his arm: It released him, falling backward"
17134,"into the water with a splash; he scrambled to his feet, but many"
17135,"more Inferi were already climbing onto the rock, their bony hands"
17136,"clawing at its slippery surface, their blank, frosted eyes upon him,"
17137,"trailing waterlogged rags, sunken faces leering."
17138,"“Petrificus Totalus!” Harry bellowed again, backing away as he"
17139,"swiped his wand through the air; six or seven of them crumpled,"
17140,but more were coming toward him. “Impedimenta! Incarcerous!”
17141,"A few of them stumbled, one or two of them bound in ropes,"
17142,but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over
17143,"or on the fallen bodies. Still slashing at the air with his wand, Harry"
17144,"yelled, “Sectumsempra! SECTUMSEMPRA!”"
17145,But though gashes appeared in their sodden rags and their icy
17146,"skin, they had no blood to spill: They walked on, unfeeling, their"
17147,  575  
17148,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
17149,"shrunken hands outstretched toward him, and as he backed away"
17150,"still farther, he felt arms enclose him from behind, thin, fleshless"
17151,"arms cold as death, and his feet left the ground as they lifted him"
17152,"and began to carry him, slowly and surely, back to the water, and"
17153,"he knew there would be no release, that he would be drowned, and"
17154,become one more dead guardian of a fragment of Voldemort’s shat-
17155,tered soul. . . .
17156,"But then, through the darkness, fire erupted: crimson and gold,"
17157,a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the Inferi holding
17158,Harry so tightly stumbled and faltered; they did not dare pass
17159,through the flames to get to the water. They dropped Harry; he hit
17160,"the ground, slipped on the rock, and fell, grazing his arms, but"
17161,"scrambled back up, raising his wand and staring around."
17162,"Dumbledore was on his feet again, pale as any of the surround-"
17163,"ing Inferi, but taller than any too, the fire dancing in his eyes; his"
17164,"wand was raised like a torch and from its tip emanated the flames,"
17165,"like a vast lasso, encircling them all with warmth."
17166,"The Inferi bumped into each other, attempting, blindly, to es-"
17167,cape the fire in which they were enclosed. . . .
17168,Dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone
17169,"basin and stowed it inside his robes. Wordlessly, he gestured to"
17170,"Harry to come to his side. Distracted by the flames, the Inferi"
17171,seemed unaware that their quarry was leaving as Dumbledore led
17172,"Harry back to the boat, the ring of fire moving with them, around"
17173,"them, the bewildered Inferi accompanying them to the water’s edge,"
17174,where they slipped gratefully back into their dark waters.
17175,"Harry, who was shaking all over, thought for a moment that"
17176,Dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat; he staggered
17177, 576   
17178,THE CAVE
17179,a little as he attempted it; all his efforts seemed to be going into
17180,maintaining the ring of protective flame around them. Harry
17181,seized him and helped him back to his seat. Once they were both
17182,"safely jammed inside again, the boat began to move back across the"
17183,"black water, away from the rock, still encircled by that ring of fire,"
17184,and it seemed that the Inferi swarming below them did not dare
17185,resurface.
17186,"“Sir,” panted Harry, “sir, I forgot — about fire — they were"
17187,coming at me and I panicked —”
17188,"“Quite understandable,” murmured Dumbledore. Harry was"
17189,alarmed to hear how faint his voice was.
17190,"They reached the bank with a little bump and Harry leapt out,"
17191,then turned quickly to help Dumbledore. The moment that Dum-
17192,bledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall; the ring of fire
17193,"vanished, but the Inferi did not emerge again from the water. The"
17194,"little boat sank into the water once more; clanking and tinkling, its"
17195,chain slithered back into the lake too. Dumbledore gave a great
17196,sigh and leaned against the cavern wall.
17197,“I am weak. . . .” he said.
17198,"“Don’t worry, sir,” said Harry at once, anxious about Dumble-"
17199,"dore’s extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion. “Don’t worry, I’ll"
17200,"get us back. . . . Lean on me, sir. . . .”"
17201,"And pulling Dumbledore’s uninjured arm around his shoulders,"
17202,"Harry guided his headmaster back around the lake, bearing most of"
17203,his weight.
17204,"“The protection was . . . after all . . . well-designed,” said Dum-"
17205,bledore faintly. “One alone could not have done it. . . . You did

17211,sir. . . . We’ll soon be out of here. . . .”
17212,“The archway will have sealed again. . . . My knife . . .”
17213,"“There’s no need, I got cut on the rock,” said Harry firmly. “Just"
17214,tell me where. . . .”
17215,“Here . . .”
17216,Harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone: Having re-
17217,"ceived its tribute of blood, the archway reopened instantly. They"
17218,"crossed the outer cave, and Harry helped Dumbledore back into"
17219,the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff.
17220,"“It’s going to be all right, sir,” Harry said over and over again,"
17221,more worried by Dumbledore’s silence than he had been by his
17222,weakened voice. “We’re nearly there. . . . I can Apparate us both
17223,back. . . . Don’t worry. . . .”
17224,"“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little"

17233,concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination:
17234,"Hogsmeade. Closing his eyes, gripping Dumbledore’s arm as"
17235,"tightly as he could, he stepped forward into that feeling of horrible"
17236,compression.
17237,He knew it had worked before he opened his eyes: The smell of
17238,"salt, the sea breeze had gone. He and Dumbledore were shivering"
17239,and dripping in the middle of the dark High Street in Hogsmeade.
17240,For one horrible moment Harry’s imagination showed him more
17241,"Inferi creeping toward him around the sides of shops, but he"
17242,"blinked and saw that nothing was stirring; all was still, the darkness"
17243,complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper windows.
17244,"“We did it, Professor!” Harry whispered with difficulty; he"
17245, 579  
17246,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
17247,suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest. “We did
17248,it! We got the Horcrux!”
17249,"Dumbledore staggered against him. For a moment, Harry"
17250,thought that his inexpert Apparition had thrown Dumbledore off
17251,"balance; then he saw his face, paler and damper than ever in the"
17252,distant light of a streetlamp.
17253,"“Sir, are you all right?”"
17254,"“I’ve been better,” said Dumbledore weakly, though the corners"
17255,of his mouth twitched. “That potion . . . was no health drink. . . .”
17256,"And to Harry’s horror, Dumbledore sank onto the ground."
17257,"“Sir — it’s okay, sir, you’re going to be all right, don’t worry —”"
17258,"He looked around desperately for help, but there was nobody to"
17259,be seen and all he could think was that he must somehow get
17260,Dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing.
17261,"“We need to get you up to the school, sir. . . . Madam Pom-"
17262,frey . . .”
17263,"“No,” said Dumbledore. “It is . . . Professor Snape whom I"
17264,need. . . . But I do not think . . . I can walk very far just yet. . . .”
17265,"“Right — sir, listen — I’m going to knock on a door, find a"
17266,place you can stay — then I can run and get Madam —”
17267,"“Severus,” said Dumbledore clearly. “I need Severus. . . .”"
17268,"“All right then, Snape — but I’m going to have to leave you for"
17269,a moment so I can —”
17270,"Before Harry could make a move, however, he heard running"
17271,"footsteps. His heart leapt: Somebody had seen, somebody knew"
17272,they needed help — and looking around he saw Madam Rosmerta
17273,"scurrying down the dark street toward them on high-heeled, fluffy"
17274,"slippers, wearing a silk dressing gown embroidered with dragons."
17275,“I saw you Apparate as I was pulling my bedroom curtains!

17279,"Thank goodness, thank goodness, I couldn’t think what to — but"
17280,what’s wrong with Albus?”
17281,"She came to a halt, panting, and stared down, wide-eyed, at"
17282,Dumbledore.
17283,"“He’s hurt,” said Harry. “Madam Rosmerta, can he come into"
17284,the Three Broomsticks while I go up to the school and get help for
17285,him?”
17286,“You can’t go up there alone! Don’t you realize — haven’t you
17287,seen — ?
17288,"“If you help me support him,” said Harry, not listening to her,"
17289,“I think we can get him inside —”
17290,"“What has happened?” asked Dumbledore. “Rosmerta, what’s"
17291,wrong?”
17292,"“The — the Dark Mark, Albus.”"
17293,"And she pointed into the sky, in the direction of Hogwarts."
17294,Dread flooded Harry at the sound of the words. . . . He turned and
17295,looked.
17296,"There it was, hanging in the sky above the school: the blazing"
17297,"green skull with a serpent tongue, the mark Death Eaters left be-"
17298,hind whenever they had entered a building . . . wherever they had
17299,murdered. . . .
17300,"“When did it appear?” asked Dumbledore, and his hand"
17301,clenched painfully upon Harry’s shoulder as he struggled to his
17302,feet.
17303,"“Must have been minutes ago, it wasn’t there when I put the cat"
17304,"out, but when I got upstairs —”"
17305,"“We need to return to the castle at once,” said Dumbledore."
17306,"“Rosmerta” — and though he staggered a little, he seemed wholly"
17307,in command of the situation — “we need transport — brooms —”
17308, 581  
17309,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
17310,"“I’ve got a couple behind the bar,” she said, looking very fright-"
17311,ened. “Shall I run and fetch — ?”
17312,"“No, Harry can do it.”"
17313,Harry raised his wand at once.
17314,“Accio Rosmerta’s Brooms!”
17315,A second later they heard a loud bang as the front door of the
17316,pub burst open; two brooms had shot out into the street and were
17317,"racing each other to Harry’s side, where they stopped dead, quiver-"
17318,ing slightly at waist height.
17319,"“Rosmerta, please send a message to the Ministry,” said Dum-"
17320,"bledore, as he mounted the broom nearest him. “It might be that"
17321,nobody within Hogwarts has yet realized anything is wrong. . . .
17322,"Harry, put on your Invisibility Cloak.”"
17323,Harry pulled his Cloak out of his pocket and threw it over him-
17324,self before mounting his broom: Madam Rosmerta was already
17325,tottering back toward her pub as Harry and Dumbledore kicked
17326,off from the ground and rose up into the air. As they sped toward
17327,"the castle, Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, ready to grab"
17328,"him should he fall, but the sight of the Dark Mark seemed to have"
17329,acted upon Dumbledore like a stimulant: He was bent low over
17330,"his broom, his eyes fixed upon the Mark, his long silver hair and"
17331,beard flying behind him on the night air. And Harry too looked
17332,"ahead at the skull, and fear swelled inside him like a venomous"
17333,"bubble, compressing his lungs, driving all other discomfort from"
17334,his mind. . . .
17335,"How long had they been away? Had Ron, Hermione, and"
17336,Ginny’s luck run out by now? Was it one of them who had caused
17337,"the Mark to be set over the school, or was it Neville, or Luna, or"
17338,some other member of the D.A.? And if it was . . . he was the one
17339, 582   
17340,THE LIGHTNING -
17341,STRUCK TOWER
17342,"who had told them to patrol the corridors, he had asked them to"
17343,"leave the safety of their beds. . . . Would he be responsible, again,"
17344,for the death of a friend?
17345,"As they flew over the dark, twisting lane down which they had"
17346,"walked earlier, Harry heard, over the whistling of the night air in"
17347,"his ears, Dumbledore muttering in some strange language again."
17348,He thought he understood why as he felt his broom shudder when
17349,they flew over the boundary wall into the grounds: Dumbledore
17350,was undoing the enchantments he himself had set around the cas-
17351,tle so they could enter at speed. The Dark Mark was glittering di-
17352,"rectly above the Astronomy Tower, the highest of the castle. Did"
17353,that mean the death had occurred there?
17354,Dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated ramparts and
17355,was dismounting; Harry landed next to him seconds later and
17356,looked around.
17357,The ramparts were deserted. The door to the spiral staircase that
17358,"led back into the castle was closed. There was no sign of a struggle,"
17359,"of a fight to the death, of a body."
17360,"“What does it mean?” Harry asked Dumbledore, looking up at"
17361,the green skull with its serpent’s tongue glinting evilly above them.
17362,“Is it the real Mark? Has someone definitely been — Professor?”
17363,"In the dim green glow from the Mark, Harry saw Dumbledore"
17364,clutching at his chest with his blackened hand.
17365,"“Go and wake Severus,” said Dumbledore faintly but clearly."
17366,“Tell him what has happened and bring him to me. Do nothing
17367,"else, speak to nobody else, and do not remove your cloak. I shall"
17368,wait here.”
17369,“But —”
17370,"“You swore to obey me, Harry — go!”"
17371, 583   
17372,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
17373,"Harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase, but"
17374,his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when
17375,he heard running footsteps on the other side. He looked around at
17376,"Dumbledore, who gestured him to retreat. Harry backed away,"
17377,drawing his wand as he did so.
17378,The door burst open and somebody erupted through it and
17379,"shouted, “Expelliarmus!”"
17380,"Harry’s body became instantly rigid and immobile, and he felt"
17381,"himself fall back against the tower wall, propped like an unsteady"
17382,"statue, unable to move or speak. He could not understand how it"
17383,had happened — Expelliarmus was not a Freezing Charm —
17384,"Then, by the light of the Mark, he saw Dumbledore’s wand fly-"
17385,ing in an arc over the edge of the ramparts and understood. . . .
17386,"Dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized Harry, and the second he"
17387,had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defend-
17388,ing himself.
17389,"Standing against the ramparts, very white in the face, Dumble-"
17390,dore still showed no sign of panic or distress. He merely looked
17391,"across at his disarmer and said, “Good evening, Draco.”"
17392,"Malfoy stepped forward, glancing around quickly to check that"
17393,he and Dumbledore were alone. His eyes fell upon the second
17394,broom.
17395,“Who else is here?”
17396,“A question I might ask you. Or are you acting alone?”
17397,Harry saw Malfoy’s pale eyes shift back to Dumbledore in the
17398,greenish glare of the Mark.
17399,"“No,” he said. “I’ve got backup. There are Death Eaters here in"
17400,your school tonight.”
17401,"“Well, well,” said Dumbledore, as though Malfoy was showing"
17402,  584 
17403,THE LIGHTNING -
17404,STRUCK TOWER
17405,him an ambitious homework project. “Very good indeed. You
17406,"found a way to let them in, did you?”"
17407,"“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who was panting. “Right under your nose"
17408,and you never realized!”
17409,"“Ingenious,” said Dumbledore. “Yet . . . forgive me . . . where"
17410,are they now? You seem unsupported.”
17411,“They met some of your guards. They’re having a fight down be-
17412,low. They won’t be long. . . . I came on ahead. I — I’ve got a job to
17413,do.”
17414,"“Well, then, you must get on and do it, my dear boy,” said"
17415,Dumbledore softly.
17416,There was silence. Harry stood imprisoned within his own in-
17417,"visible, paralyzed body, staring at the two of them, his ears strain-"
17418,"ing to hear sounds of the Death Eaters’ distant fight, and in front"
17419,"of him, Draco Malfoy did nothing but stare at Albus Dumbledore,"
17420,"who, incredibly, smiled."
17421,"“Draco, Draco, you are not a killer.”"
17422,“How do you know?” said Malfoy at once.
17423,He seemed to realize how childish the words had sounded;
17424,Harry saw him flush in the Mark’s greenish light.
17425,"“You don’t know what I’m capable of,” said Malfoy more force-"
17426,fully. “You don’t know what I’ve done!”
17427,"“Oh yes, I do,” said Dumbledore mildly. “You almost killed"
17428,"Katie Bell and Ronald Weasley. You have been trying, with increas-"
17429,"ing desperation, to kill me all year. Forgive me, Draco, but they"
17430,"have been feeble attempts. . . . So feeble, to be honest, that I won-"
17431,der whether your heart has been really in it.”
17432,“It has been in it!” said Malfoy vehemently. “I’ve been working
17433,"on it all year, and tonight —”"
17434, 585  
17435,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
17436,Somewhere in the depths of the castle below Harry heard a muf-
17437,fled yell. Malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder.
17438,"“Somebody is putting up a good fight,” said Dumbledore con-"
17439,"versationally. “But you were saying . . . yes, you have managed to"
17440,"introduce Death Eaters into my school, which, I admit, I thought"
17441,impossible. . . . How did you do it?”
17442,But Malfoy said nothing: He was still listening to whatever was
17443,happening below and seemed almost as paralyzed as Harry was.
17444,"“Perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone,” suggested"
17445,Dumbledore. “What if your backup has been thwarted by my
17446,"guard? As you have perhaps realized, there are members of the Or-"
17447,"der of the Phoenix here tonight too. And after all, you don’t really"
17448,need help. . . . I have no wand at the moment. . . . I cannot defend
17449,myself.”
17450,Malfoy merely stared at him.
17451,"“I see,” said Dumbledore kindly, when Malfoy neither moved"
17452,nor spoke. “You are afraid to act until they join you.”
17453,"“I’m not afraid!” snarled Malfoy, though he still made no move"
17454,to hurt Dumbledore. “It’s you who should be scared!”
17455,"“But why? I don’t think you will kill me, Draco. Killing is not"
17456,"nearly as easy as the innocent believe. . . . So tell me, while we wait"
17457,for your friends . . . how did you smuggle them in here? It seems to
17458,have taken you a long time to work out how to do it.”
17459,Malfoy looked as though he was fighting down the urge to
17460,"shout, or to vomit. He gulped and took several deep breaths, glar-"
17461,"ing at Dumbledore, his wand pointing directly at the latter’s heart."
17462,"Then, as though he could not help himself, he said, “I had to mend"
17463,that broken Vanishing Cabinet that no one’s used for years. The
17464,one Montague got lost in last year.”
17465, 586  
17466,THE LIGHTNING -
17467,STRUCK TOWER
17468,“Aaaah.” Dumbledore’s sigh was half a groan. He closed his eyes
17469,"for a moment. “That was clever. . . . There is a pair, I take it?”"
17470,"“In Borgin and Burkes,” said Malfoy, “and they make a kind of"
17471,passage between them. Montague told me that when he was stuck
17472,"in the Hogwarts one, he was trapped in limbo but sometimes he"
17473,"could hear what was going on at school, and sometimes what was"
17474,"going on in the shop, as if the cabinet was traveling between them,"
17475,"but he couldn’t make anyone hear him. . . . In the end, he managed"
17476,"to Apparate out, even though he’d never passed his test. He nearly"
17477,"died doing it. Everyone thought it was a really good story, but I was"
17478,the only one who realized what it meant — even Borgin didn’t
17479,know — I was the one who realized there could be a way into Hog-
17480,warts through the cabinets if I fixed the broken one.”
17481,"“Very good,” murmured Dumbledore. “So the Death Eaters"
17482,were able to pass from Borgin and Burkes into the school to help
17483,"you. . . . A clever plan, a very clever plan . . . and, as you say, right"
17484,under my nose.”
17485,"“Yeah,” said Malfoy, who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and"
17486,"comfort from Dumbledore’s praise. “Yeah, it was!”"
17487,"“But there were times,” Dumbledore went on, “weren’t there,"
17488,when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabi-
17489,net? And you resorted to crude and badly judged measures such as
17490,sending me a cursed necklace that was bound to reach the wrong
17491,hands . . . poisoning mead there was only the slightest chance I
17492,might drink. . . .”
17493,"“Yeah, well, you still didn’t realize who was behind that stuff, did"
17494,"you?” sneered Malfoy, as Dumbledore slid a little down the ram-"
17495,"parts, the strength in his legs apparently fading, and Harry strug-"
17496,"gled fruitlessly, mutely, against the enchantment binding him."
17497, 587   
17498,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
17499,"“As a matter of fact, I did,” said Dumbledore. “I was sure it was"
17500,you.
17501,"“Why didn’t you stop me, then?” Malfoy demanded."
17502,"“I tried, Draco. Professor Snape has been keeping watch over"
17503,you on my orders —”
17504,"“He hasn’t been doing your orders, he promised my mother —”"
17505,"“Of course that is what he would tell you, Draco, but —”"
17506,"“He’s a double agent, you stupid old man, he isn’t working for"
17507,"you, you just think he is!”"
17508,"“We must agree to differ on that, Draco. It so happens that I"
17509,trust Professor Snape —”
17510,"“Well, you’re losing your grip, then!” sneered Malfoy. “He’s been"
17511,offering me plenty of help — wanting all the glory for himself—
17512,wanting a bit of the action — ‘What are you doing?’ ‘Did you do
17513,"the necklace, that was stupid, it could have blown everything —’"
17514,But I haven’t told him what I’ve been doing in the Room of Re-
17515,"quirement, he’s going to wake up tomorrow and it’ll all be over and"
17516,"he won’t be the Dark Lord’s favorite anymore, he’ll be nothing"
17517,"compared to me, nothing!”"
17518,"“Very gratifying,” said Dumbledore mildly. “We all like appreci-"
17519,"ation for our own hard work, of course. But you must have had an"
17520,"accomplice, all the same . . . someone in Hogsmeade, someone"
17521,who was able to slip Katie the — the — aaaah . . .”
17522,"Dumbledore closed his eyes again and nodded, as though he was"
17523,about to fall asleep. “. . . of course . . . Rosmerta. How long has she
17524,been under the Imperius Curse?”
17525,"“Got there at last, have you?” Malfoy taunted."
17526,"There was another yell from below, rather louder than the last."

17530,"Malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again, then back at"
17531,"Dumbledore, who went on: “So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk"
17532,in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts stu-
17533,dent who entered the room unaccompanied? And the poisoned
17534,"mead . . . well, naturally, Rosmerta was able to poison it for you"
17535,"before she sent the bottle to Slughorn, believing that it was to be"
17536,"my Christmas present. . . . Yes, very neat . . . very neat . . . Poor"
17537,"Mr. Filch would not, of course, think to check a bottle of Rosmer-"
17538,"ta’s. Tell me, how have you been communicating with Rosmerta? I"
17539,thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the
17540,school monitored.”
17541,"“Enchanted coins,” said Malfoy, as though he was compelled to"
17542,"keep talking, though his wand hand was shaking badly. “I had one"
17543,and she had the other and I could send her messages —”
17544,“Isn’t that the secret method of communication the group that
17545,called themselves Dumbledore’s Army used last year?” asked Dum-
17546,"bledore. His voice was light and conversational, but Harry saw him"
17547,slip an inch lower down the wall as he said it.
17548,"“Yeah, I got the idea from them,” said Malfoy, with a twisted"
17549,smile. “I got the idea of poisoning the mead from the Mudblood
17550,"Granger as well, I heard her talking in the library about Filch not"
17551,recognizing potions.”
17552,"“Please do not use that offensive word in front of me,” said"
17553,Dumbledore.
17554,Malfoy gave a harsh laugh. “You care about me saying ‘Mud-
17555,blood’ when I’m about to kill you?”
17556,"“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a lit-"
17557,tle on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. “But as for being
17558, 589  
17559,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
17560,"about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now,"
17561,"we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have"
17562,"dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted. . . .”"
17563,"Malfoy’s mouth contorted involuntarily, as though he had tasted"
17564,something very bitter.
17565,"“Now, about tonight,” Dumbledore went on, “I am a little"
17566,puzzled about how it happened. . . . You knew that I had left the
17567,"school? But of course,” he answered his own question, “Rosmerta"
17568,"saw me leaving, she tipped you off using your ingenious coins, I’m"
17569,sure.
17570,"“That’s right,” said Malfoy. “But she said you were just going for"
17571,"a drink, you’d be back. . . .”"
17572,"“Well, I certainly did have a drink . . . and I came back . . . after"
17573,"a fashion,” mumbled Dumbledore. “So you decided to spring a"
17574,trap for me?”
17575,“We decided to put the Dark Mark over the tower and get you
17576,"to hurry up here, to see who’d been killed,” said Malfoy. “And it"
17577,worked!”
17578,“Well . . . yes and no . . .” said Dumbledore. “But am I to take
17579,"it, then, that nobody has been murdered?”"
17580,"“Someone’s dead,” said Malfoy, and his voice seemed to go up an"
17581,"octave as he said it. “One of your people . . . I don’t know who, it"
17582,was dark. . . . I stepped over the body. . . . I was supposed to be
17583,"waiting up here when you got back, only your Phoenix lot got in"
17584,the way. . . .”
17585,"“Yes, they do that,” said Dumbledore."
17586,"There was a bang and shouts from below, louder than ever; it"
17587,sounded as though people were fighting on the actual spiral stair-
17588,"case that led to where Dumbledore, Malfoy, and Harry stood, and"

17592,Harry’s heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest. . . . Some-
17593,one was dead. . . . Malfoy had stepped over the body . . . but who
17594,was it?
17595,"“There is little time, one way or another,” said Dumbledore. “So"
17596,"let us discuss your options, Draco.”"
17597,“My options!” said Malfoy loudly. “I’m standing here with a
17598,wand — I’m about to kill you —”
17599,"“My dear boy, let us have no more pretense about that. If you"
17600,"were going to kill me, you would have done it when you first dis-"
17601,"armed me, you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about"
17602,ways and means.”
17603,"“I haven’t got any options!” said Malfoy, and he was suddenly"
17604,white as Dumbledore. “I’ve got to do it! He’ll kill me! He’ll kill my

17606,"“I appreciate the difficulty of your position,” said Dumbledore."
17607,“Why else do you think I have not confronted you before now? Be-
17608,cause I knew that you would have been murdered if Lord Volde-
17609,mort realized that I suspected you.”
17610,Malfoy winced at the sound of the name.
17611,“I did not dare speak to you of the mission with which I knew
17612,"you had been entrusted, in case he used Legilimency against you,”"
17613,continued Dumbledore. “But now at last we can speak plainly to
17614,"each other. . . . No harm has been done, you have hurt nobody,"
17615,though you are very lucky that your unintentional victims sur-
17616,"vived. . . . I can help you, Draco.”"
17617,"“No, you can’t,” said Malfoy, his wand hand shaking very badly"
17618,indeed. “Nobody can. He told me to do it or he’ll kill me. I’ve got
17619,no choice.”

17622,"“Come over to the right side, Draco, and we can hide you more"
17623,"completely than you can possibly imagine. What is more, I can send"
17624,members of the Order to your mother tonight to hide her like-
17625,wise. Your father is safe at the moment in Azkaban. . . . When the
17626,"time comes, we can protect him too. Come over to the right side,"
17627,Draco . . . you are not a killer. . . .”
17628,Malfoy stared at Dumbledore.
17629,"“But I got this far, didn’t I?” he said slowly. “They thought I’d die"
17630,"in the attempt, but I’m here . . . and you’re in my power. . . . I’m"
17631,the one with the wand. . . . You’re at my mercy. . . .”
17632,"“No, Draco,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It is my mercy, and not"
17633,"yours, that matters now.”"
17634,"Malfoy did not speak. His mouth was open, his wand hand still"
17635,trembling. Harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction —
17636,"But suddenly footsteps were thundering up the stairs, and a sec-"
17637,ond later Malfoy was buffeted out of the way as four people in
17638,black robes burst through the door onto the ramparts. Still para-
17639,"lyzed, his eyes staring unblinkingly, Harry gazed in terror upon"
17640,four strangers: It seemed the Death Eaters had won the fight below.
17641,A lumpy-looking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy
17642,giggle.
17643,"“Dumbledore cornered!” he said, and he turned to a stocky little"
17644,woman who looked as though she could be his sister and who was
17645,"grinning eagerly. “Dumbledore wandless, Dumbledore alone! Well"
17646,"done, Draco, well done!”"
17647,"“Good evening, Amycus,” said Dumbledore calmly, as though"
17648,welcoming the man to a tea party. “And you’ve brought Alecto too.
17649,. . . Charming . . .”

17653,The woman gave an angry little titter. “Think your little jokes’ll
17654,help you on your deathbed then?” she jeered.
17655,"“Jokes? No, no, these are manners,” replied Dumbledore."
17656,"“Do it,” said the stranger standing nearest to Harry, a big, rangy"
17657,"man with matted gray hair and whiskers, whose black Death"
17658,Eater’s robes looked uncomfortably tight. He had a voice like none
17659,that Harry had ever heard: a rasping bark of a voice. Harry could
17660,"smell a powerful mixture of dirt, sweat, and, unmistakably, of"
17661,blood coming from him. His filthy hands had long yellowish nails.
17662,"“Is that you, Fenrir?” asked Dumbledore."
17663,"“That’s right,” rasped the other. “Pleased to see me, Dumbledore?”"
17664,"“No, I cannot say that I am.”"
17665,"Greyback grinned, showing pointed teeth. Blood trickled down"
17666,"his chin and he licked his lips slowly, obscenely."
17667,"“But you know how much I like kids, Dumbledore.”"
17668,“Am I to take it that you are attacking even without the full
17669,moon now? This is most unusual. . . . You have developed a taste
17670,for human flesh that cannot be satisfied once a month?”
17671,"“That’s right,” said Fenrir Greyback. “Shocks you that, does it,"
17672,Dumbledore? Frightens you?”
17673,"“Well, I cannot pretend it does not disgust me a little,” said"
17674,"Dumbledore. “And, yes, I am a little shocked that Draco here in-"
17675,"vited you, of all people, into the school where his friends live. . . .”"
17676,"“I didn’t,” breathed Malfoy. He was not looking at Fenrir; he did"
17677,not seem to want to even glance at him. “I didn’t know he was go-
17678,ing to come —”
17679,"“I wouldn’t want to miss a trip to Hogwarts, Dumbledore,”"
17680,rasped Greyback. “Not when there are throats to be ripped out. . .
17681,"Delicious, delicious . . .”"

17684,"And he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth,"
17685,"leering at Dumbledore. “I could do you for afters, Dumbledore.”"
17686,"“No,” said the fourth Death Eater sharply. He had a heavy, bru-"
17687,"tal-looking face. “We’ve got orders. Draco’s got to do it. Now,"
17688,"Draco, and quickly.”"
17689,Malfoy was showing less resolution than ever. He looked terri-
17690,"fied as he stared into Dumbledore’s face, which was even paler,"
17691,"and rather lower than usual, as he had slid so far down the rampart"
17692,wall.
17693,"“He’s not long for this world anyway, if you ask me!” said the"
17694,"lopsided man, to the accompaniment of his sister’s wheezing gig-"
17695,"gles. “Look at him — what’s happened to you, then, Dumby?”"
17696,"“Oh, weaker resistance, slower reflexes, Amycus,” said Dumble-"
17697,"dore. “Old age, in short . . . One day, perhaps, it will happen to"
17698,you . . . if you are lucky. . . .”
17699,"“What’s that mean, then, what’s that mean?” yelled the Death"
17700,"Eater, suddenly violent. “Always the same, weren’t yeh, Dumby,"
17701,"talking and doing nothing, nothing. I don’t even know why the"
17702,"Dark Lord’s bothering to kill yer! Come on, Draco, do it!”"
17703,But at that moment there were renewed sounds of scuffling from
17704,"below and a voice shouted, “They’ve blocked the stairs — Reducto!"
17705,REDUCTO !”
17706,Harry’s heart leapt: So these four had not eliminated all opposi-
17707,"tion, but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower,"
17708,"and, by the sound of it, created a barrier behind them —"
17709,"“Now, Draco, quickly!” said the brutal-faced man angrily."
17710,But Malfoy’s hand was shaking so badly that he could barely
17711,aim.

17715,"“I’ll do it,” snarled Fenrir, moving toward Dumbledore with his"
17716,"hands outstretched, his teeth bared."
17717,“I said no!” shouted the brutal-faced man; there was a flash of
17718,light and the werewolf was blasted out of the way; he hit the ram-
17719,"parts and staggered, looking furious. Harry’s heart was hammering"
17720,so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing
17721,"there, imprisoned by Dumbledore’s spell — if he could only move,"
17722,he could aim a curse from under the cloak —
17723,"“Draco, do it or stand aside so one of us —” screeched the"
17724,"woman, but at that precise moment, the door to the ramparts burst"
17725,"open once more and there stood Snape, his wand clutched in his"
17726,"hand as his black eyes swept the scene, from Dumbledore slumped"
17727,"against the wall, to the four Death Eaters, including the enraged"
17728,"werewolf, and Malfoy."
17729,"“We’ve got a problem, Snape,” said the lumpy Amycus, whose"
17730,"eyes and wand were fixed alike upon Dumbledore, “the boy doesn’t"
17731,seem able —”
17732,"But somebody else had spoken Snape’s name, quite softly."
17733,“Severus . . .”
17734,The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experi-
17735,"enced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading."
17736,"Snape said nothing, but walked forward and pushed Malfoy"
17737,roughly out of the way. The three Death Eaters fell back without a
17738,word. Even the werewolf seemed cowed.
17739,"Snape gazed for a moment at Dumbledore, and there was revul-"
17740,sion and hatred etched in the harsh lines of his face.
17741,“Severus . . . please . . .”
17742,Snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at Dumbledore.

17745,“Avada Kedavra!”
17746,A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit
17747,Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s scream of horror never
17748,"left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumble-"
17749,"dore was blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang"
17750,"suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly back-"

17756,H           arry felt as though he too were hurtling through space;
17757,it had not happened. . . . It could not have happened. . . .
17758,"“Out of here, quickly,” said Snape."
17759,He seized Malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him
17760,through the door ahead of the rest; Greyback and the squat brother
17761,"and sister followed, the latter both panting excitedly. As they van-"
17762,"ished through the door, Harry realized he could move again. What"
17763,"was now holding him paralyzed against the wall was not magic, but"
17764,horror and shock. He threw the Invisibility Cloak aside as the bru-
17765,"tal-faced Death Eater, last to leave the tower top, was disappearing"
17766,through the door.
17767,“Petrificus Totalus!”
17768,The Death Eater buckled as though hit in the back with some-
17769,"thing solid and fell to the ground, rigid as a waxwork, but he had"
17770,barely hit the floor when Harry was clambering over him and run-
17771,ning down the darkened staircase.
17772, 597    
17773,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
17774,Terror tore at Harry’s heart. . . . He had to get to Dumbledore
17775,and he had to catch Snape. . . . Somehow the two things were
17776,linked. . . . He could reverse what had happened if he had them
17777,both together. . . . Dumbledore could not have died. . . .
17778,He leapt the last ten steps of the spiral staircase and stopped
17779,"where he landed, his wand raised: The dimly lit corridor was full of"
17780,dust; half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in; and a battle was rag-
17781,"ing before him, but even as he attempted to make out who was"
17782,"fighting whom, he heard the hated voice shout, “It’s over, time to"
17783,go!” and saw Snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of
17784,the corridor; he and Malfoy seemed to have forced their way
17785,"through the fight unscathed. As Harry plunged after them, one of"
17786,the fighters detached themselves from the fray and flew at him: It
17787,"was the werewolf, Fenrir. He was on top of Harry before Harry"
17788,"could raise his wand: Harry fell backward, with filthy matted hair"
17789,"in his face, the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and"
17790,"mouth, hot greedy breath at his throat —"
17791,“Petrificus Totalus!”
17792,Harry felt Fenrir collapse against him; with a stupendous effort
17793,he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor as a jet of green light
17794,"came flying toward him; he ducked and ran, headfirst, into the"
17795,fight. His feet met something squashy and slippery on the floor and
17796,"he stumbled: There were two bodies lying there, lying facedown in"
17797,"a pool of blood, but there was no time to investigate. Harry now"
17798,saw red hair flying like flames in front of him: Ginny was locked in
17799,"combat with the lumpy Death Eater, Amycus, who was throwing"
17800,"hex after hex at her while she dodged them: Amycus was giggling,"
17801,"enjoying the sport: “Crucio — Crucio — you can’t dance forever,"
17802,pretty —”

17805,“Impedimenta!” yelled Harry.
17806,His jinx hit Amycus in the chest: He gave a piglike squeal of
17807,"pain, was lifted off his feet and slammed into the opposite wall, slid"
17808,"down it, and fell out of sight behind Ron, Professor McGonagall,"
17809,"and Lupin, each of whom was battling a separate Death Eater. Be-"
17810,"yond them, Harry saw Tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard"
17811,"who was sending curses flying in all directions, so that they rico-"
17812,"cheted off the walls around them, cracking stone, shattering the"
17813,nearest window —
17814,"“Harry, where did you come from?” Ginny cried, but there was"
17815,"no time to answer her. He put his head down and sprinted forward,"
17816,"narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head, showering"
17817,"them all in bits of wall. Snape must not escape, he must catch up"
17818,with Snape —
17819,"“Take that!” shouted Professor McGonagall, and Harry glimpsed"
17820,"the female Death Eater, Alecto, sprinting away down the corridor"
17821,"with her arms over her head, her brother right behind her. He"
17822,"launched himself after them but his foot caught on something, and"
17823,"next moment he was lying across someone’s legs. Looking around,"
17824,"he saw Neville’s pale, round face flat against the floor."
17825,"“Neville, are you — ?”"
17826,"“M’all right,” muttered Neville, who was clutching his stomach,"
17827,“Harry . . . Snape ’n’ Malfoy . . . ran past . . .”
17828,"“I know, I’m on it!” said Harry, aiming a hex from the floor at"
17829,the enormous blond Death Eater who was causing most of the
17830,chaos. The man gave a howl of pain as the spell hit him in the face:
17831,"He wheeled around, staggered, and then pounded away after the"
17832,brother and sister. Harry scrambled up from the floor and began to
17833,"sprint along the corridor, ignoring the bangs issuing from behind"

17836,"him, the yells of the others to come back, and the mute call of the"
17837,figures on the ground whose fate he did not yet know. . . .
17838,"He skidded around the corner, his trainers slippery with blood;"
17839,Snape had an immense head start. Was it possible that he had al-
17840,"ready entered the cabinet in the Room of Requirement, or had the"
17841,"Order made steps to secure it, to prevent the Death Eaters retreat-"
17842,"ing that way? He could hear nothing but his own pounding feet,"
17843,his own hammering heart as he sprinted along the next empty cor-
17844,"ridor, but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one"
17845,of the fleeing Death Eaters was heading toward the front doors —
17846,perhaps the Room of Requirement was indeed blocked —
17847,He skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him; he
17848,dived behind a suit of armor that exploded. He saw the brother and
17849,sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinxes at
17850,"them, but merely hit several bewigged witches in a portrait on the"
17851,"landing, who ran screeching into neighboring paintings. As he"
17852,"leapt the wreckage of armor, Harry heard more shouts and screams;"
17853,other people within the castle seemed to have awoken. . . .
17854,"He pelted toward a shortcut, hoping to overtake the brother and"
17855,"sister and close in on Snape and Malfoy, who must surely have"
17856,reached the grounds by now. Remembering to leap the vanishing
17857,"step halfway down the concealed staircase, he burst through a"
17858,tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of
17859,bewildered and pajama-clad Hufflepuffs stood.
17860,"“Harry! We heard a noise, and someone said something about"
17861,the Dark Mark —” began Ernie Macmillan.
17862,"“Out of the way!” yelled Harry, knocking two boys aside as he"
17863,sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble
17864,"staircase. The oak front doors had been blasted open, there were"

17867,"smears of blood on the flagstones, and several terrified students"
17868,"stood huddled against the walls, one or two still cowering with"
17869,their arms over their faces. The giant Gryffindor hourglass had
17870,"been hit by a curse, and the rubies within were still falling, with a"
17871,"loud rattle, onto the flagstones below."
17872,Harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark grounds:
17873,"He could just make out three figures racing across the lawn, heading"
17874,for the gates beyond which they could Disapparate — by the looks
17875,"of them, the huge blond Death Eater and, some way ahead of him,"
17876,Snape and Malfoy . . .
17877,The cold night air ripped at Harry’s lungs as he tore after them;
17878,he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted
17879,"his quarry. He did not know what it was but continued to run, not"
17880,yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse —
17881,"Another flash, shouts, retaliatory jets of light, and Harry under-"
17882,stood: Hagrid had emerged from his cabin and was trying to stop
17883,"the Death Eaters escaping, and though every breath seemed to"
17884,"shred his lungs and the stitch in his chest was like fire, Harry sped"
17885,up as an unbidden voice in his head said: not Hagrid . . . not Ha-
17886,grid too . . .
17887,Something caught Harry hard in the small of the back and he
17888,"fell forward, his face smacking the ground, blood pouring out of"
17889,"both nostrils: He knew, even as he rolled over, his wand ready, that"
17890,the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were
17891,closing in behind him. . . .
17892,"“Impedimenta!” he yelled as he rolled over again, crouching close"
17893,"to the dark ground, and miraculously his jinx hit one of them, who"
17894,"stumbled and fell, tripping up the other; Harry leapt to his feet and"
17895,sprinted on after Snape.
17896,  601  
17897,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
17898,"And now he saw the vast outline of Hagrid, illuminated by the"
17899,light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind clouds; the
17900,blond Death Eater was aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper;
17901,but Hagrid’s immense strength and the toughened skin he had in-
17902,herited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him.
17903,"Snape and Malfoy, however, were still running; they would soon be"
17904,"beyond the gates, able to Disapparate —"
17905,"Harry tore past Hagrid and his opponent, took aim at Snape’s"
17906,"back, and yelled, “Stupefy!”"
17907,He missed; the jet of red light soared past Snape’s head; Snape
17908,"shouted, “Run, Draco!” and turned. Twenty yards apart, he and Harry"
17909,looked at each other before raising their wands simultaneously.
17910,“Cruc —”
17911,"But Snape parried the curse, knocking Harry backward off his"
17912,feet before he could complete it; Harry rolled over and scrambled
17913,"back up again as the huge Death Eater behind him yelled, “Incen-"
17914,dio!” Harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light
17915,spilled over all of them: Hagrid’s house was on fire.
17916,"“Fang’s in there, yer evil — !” Hagrid bellowed."
17917,"“Cruc —” yelled Harry for the second time, aiming for the fig-"

17919,the spell again. Harry could see him sneering.
17920,"“No Unforgivable Curses from you, Potter!” he shouted over the"
17921,"rushing of the flames, Hagrid’s yells, and the wild yelping of the"
17922,trapped Fang. “You haven’t got the nerve or the ability —”
17923,"“Incarc —” Harry roared, but Snape deflected the spell with an"
17924,almost lazy flick of his arm.

17929,"“Coward, did you call me, Potter?” shouted Snape. “Your father"

17931,"call him, I wonder?”"
17932,“Stupe —”
17933,“Blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your

17938,“Impedi —”
17939,"But before he could finish this jinx, excruciating pain hit Harry;"
17940,"he keeled over in the grass. Someone was screaming, he would"
17941,"surely die of this agony, Snape was going to torture him to death or"
17942,madness —
17943,“No!” roared Snape’s voice and the pain stopped as suddenly as
17944,"it had started; Harry lay curled on the dark grass, clutching his"
17945,"wand and panting; somewhere overhead Snape was shouting,"
17946,“Have you forgotten our orders? Potter belongs to the Dark
17947,Lord — we are to leave him! Go! Go!”
17948,And Harry felt the ground shudder under his face as the brother
17949,"and sister and the enormous Death Eater obeyed, running toward"
17950,"the gates. Harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage: In that instant,"
17951,he cared not whether he lived or died. Pushing himself to his feet
17952,"again, he staggered blindly toward Snape, the man he now hated as"
17953,much as he hated Voldemort himself —
17954,“Sectum — !”
17955,Snape flicked his wand and the curse was repelled yet again; but
17956,Harry was mere feet away now and he could see Snape’s face clearly
17957,at last: He was no longer sneering or jeering; the blazing flames

17961,"tion, Harry thought, Levi —"
17962,"“No, Potter!” screamed Snape. There was a loud BANG and"
17963,"Harry was soaring backward, hitting the ground hard again, and"
17964,this time his wand flew out of his hand. He could hear Hagrid
17965,yelling and Fang howling as Snape closed in and looked down on
17966,"him where he lay, wandless and defenseless as Dumbledore had"
17967,"been. Snape’s pale face, illuminated by the flaming cabin, was suf-"
17968,fused with hatred just as it had been before he had cursed
17969,Dumbledore.
17970,"“You dare use my own spells against me, Potter? It was I who in-"

17974,Harry had dived for his wand; Snape shot a hex at it and it flew
17975,feet away into the darkness and out of sight.
17976,"“Kill me then,” panted Harry, who felt no fear at all, but only"
17977,"rage and contempt. “Kill me like you killed him, you coward —”"
17978,"“DON’T—” screamed Snape, and his face was suddenly de-"
17979,"mented, inhuman, as though he was in as much pain as the yelp-"
17980,"ing, howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them —"
17981,“CALL ME COWARD!”
17982,"And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike some-"
17983,thing hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the
17984,ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment
17985,"all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a"
17986,rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the
17987,"stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the"
17988,razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sit-
17989, 604   
17990,FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE
17991,"ting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the"
17992,"ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous"
17993,beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard
17994,him screech —
17995,"Harry struggled to his feet, looking around groggily for his"
17996,"wand, hoping to give chase again, but even as his fingers fumbled"
17997,"in the grass, discarding twigs, he knew it would be too late, and"
17998,"sure enough, by the time he had located his wand, he turned only"
17999,to see the hippogriff circling the gates. Snape had managed to Dis-
18000,apparate just beyond the school’s boundaries.
18001,"“Hagrid,” muttered Harry, still dazed, looking around."
18002,“HAGRID?”
18003,He stumbled toward the burning house as an enormous figure
18004,emerged from out of the flames carrying Fang on his back. With a
18005,"cry of thankfulness, Harry sank to his knees; he was shaking in"
18006,"every limb, his body ached all over, and his breath came in painful"
18007,stabs.
18008,"“Yeh all righ’, Harry? Yeh all righ’? Speak ter me, Harry. . . .”"
18009,"Hagrid’s huge, hairy face was swimming above Harry, blocking"
18010,out the stars. Harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair; he put
18011,out a hand and felt Fang’s reassuringly warm and alive body quiv-
18012,ering beside him.
18013,"“I’m all right,” panted Harry. “Are you?”"
18014,“ ’Course I am . . . take more’n that ter finish me.”
18015,Hagrid put his hands under Harry’s arms and raised him up
18016,with such force that Harry’s feet momentarily left the ground be-
18017,fore Hagrid set him upright again. He could see blood trickling
18018,"down Hagrid’s cheek from a deep cut under one eye, which was"
18019,swelling rapidly.
18020, 605  
18021,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
18022,"“We should put out your house,” said Harry, “the charm’s ‘Agua-"
18023,menti’ . . .”
18024,"“Knew it was summat like that,” mumbled Hagrid, and he"
18025,"raised a smoldering pink, flowery umbrella and said, “Aguamenti!”"
18026,A jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip. Harry raised his wand
18027,"arm, which felt like lead, and murmured “Aguamenti” too: To-"
18028,"gether, he and Hagrid poured water on the house until the last"
18029,flame was extinguished.
18030,"“S’not too bad,” said Hagrid hopefully a few minutes later, look-"
18031,ing at the smoking wreck. “Nothin’ Dumbledore won’ be able to
18032,put righ’ . . .”
18033,Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the
18034,"name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him."
18035,“Hagrid . . .”
18036,“I was bindin’ up a couple o’ bowtruckle legs when I heard ’em
18037,"comin’,” said Hagrid sadly, still staring at his wrecked cabin."
18038,"“They’ll’ve bin burnt ter twigs, poor little things. . . .”"
18039,“Hagrid . . .”
18040,"“But what happened, Harry? I jus’ saw them Death Eaters run-"
18041,"nin’ down from the castle, but what the ruddy hell was Snape doin’"
18042,with ’em? Where’s he gone — was he chasin’ them?”
18043,“He . . .” Harry cleared his throat; it was dry from panic and the
18044,"smoke. “Hagrid, he killed . . .”"
18045,"“Killed?” said Hagrid loudly, staring down at Harry. “Snape"
18046,"killed? What’re yeh on abou’, Harry?”"
18047,"“Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Snape killed . . . Dumbledore.”"
18048,"Hagrid simply looked at him, the little of his face that could be"
18049,"seen completely blank, uncomprehending."
18050,"“Dumbledore wha’, Harry?”"
18051, 606  
18052,FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE
18053,“He’s dead. Snape killed him. . . .”
18054,"“Don’ say that,” said Hagrid roughly. “Snape kill Dumble-"
18055,"dore — don’ be stupid, Harry. Wha’s made yeh say tha’?”"
18056,“I saw it happen.”
18057,“Yeh couldn’ have.”
18058,"“I saw it, Hagrid.”"
18059,Hagrid shook his head; his expression was disbelieving but sym-
18060,"pathetic, and Harry knew that Hagrid thought he had sustained a"
18061,"blow to the head, that he was confused, perhaps by the aftereffects"
18062,of a jinx. . . .
18063,"“What musta happened was, Dumbledore musta told Snape ter"
18064,"go with them Death Eaters,” Hagrid said confidently. “I suppose"
18065,"he’s gotta keep his cover. Look, let’s get yeh back up ter the school."
18066,"Come on, Harry. . . .”"
18067,Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking
18068,"uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. . . ."
18069,"As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that"
18070,"many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the"
18071,"scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each"
18072,"other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over"
18073,"Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. . . ."
18074,"The oak front doors stood open ahead of them, light flooding out"
18075,"onto the drive and the lawn. Slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned"
18076,"people were creeping down the steps, looking around nervously for"
18077,some sign of the Death Eaters who had fled into the night. Harry’s
18078,"eyes, however, were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest"
18079,"tower. He imagined that he could see a black, huddled mass lying in"
18080,"the grass there, though he was really too far away to see anything of"
18081,the sort. Even as he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought
18082, 607    
18083,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
18084,"Dumbledore’s body must lie, however, he saw people beginning to"
18085,move toward it.
18086,"“What’re they all lookin’ at?” said Hagrid, as he and Harry ap-"
18087,"proached the castle front, Fang keeping as close as he could to their"
18088,"ankles. “Wha’s tha’, lyin’ on the grass?” Hagrid added sharply,"
18089,"heading now toward the foot of the Astronomy Tower, where a"
18090,"small crowd was congregating. “See it, Harry? Righ’ at the foot o’"
18091,the tower? Under where the Mark . . . Blimey . . . yeh don’ think
18092,someone got thrown — ?”
18093,"Hagrid fell silent, the thought apparently too horrible to express"
18094,"aloud. Harry walked alongside him, feeling the aches and pains in"
18095,his face and his legs where the various hexes of the last half hour
18096,"had hit him, though in an oddly detached way, as though some-"
18097,body near him was suffering them. What was real and inescapable
18098,was the awful pressing feeling in his chest. . . .
18099,"He and Hagrid moved, dreamlike, through the murmuring"
18100,"crowd to the very front, where the dumbstruck students and teach-"
18101,ers had left a gap.
18102,"Harry heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not"
18103,stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where
18104,Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known
18105,there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse
18106,"Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have"
18107,"happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no"
18108,"preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest"
18109,"wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet."
18110,Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his
18111,"arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out,"
18112,"straightened the half-moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and"
18113, 608  
18114,FLIGHT OF THE PRINCE
18115,wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then
18116,he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enor-
18117,mous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dum-
18118,"bledore speak to him, never again could he help. . . ."
18119,The crowd murmured behind Harry. After what seemed like a
18120,"long time, he became aware that he was kneeling upon something"
18121,hard and looked down.
18122,The locket they had managed to steal so many hours before had
18123,"fallen out of Dumbledore’s pocket. It had opened, perhaps due to"
18124,the force with which it hit the ground. And although he could not
18125,"feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already, Harry"
18126,"knew, as he picked it up, that there was something wrong. . . ."
18127,He turned the locket over in his hands. This was neither as large
18128,"as the locket he remembered seeing in the Pensieve, nor were there"
18129,"any markings upon it, no sign of the ornate S that was supposed to"
18130,"be Slytherin’s mark. Moreover, there was nothing inside but for a"
18131,scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a
18132,portrait should have been.
18133,"Automatically, without really thinking about what he was doing,"
18134,"Harry pulled out the fragment of parchment, opened it, and read by"
18135,the light of the many wands that had now been lit behind him:
18136,To the Dark Lord
18137,I know I will be dead long before you read this
18138,but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret.
18139,I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.
18140,"I face death in the hope that when you meet your match,"
18141,you will be mortal once more.
18142,R.A.B.
18143, 609   
18144,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
18145,Harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant. Only
18146,one thing mattered: This was not a Horcrux. Dumbledore had
18147,weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing.
18148,"Harry crumpled the parchment in his hand, and his eyes burned"
18149,with tears as behind him Fang began to howl.

18153,"C      ’mere, Harry . . .”"
18154,“No.”
18155,"“Yeh can’ stay here, Harry. . . . Come on, now. . . .”"
18156,“No.”
18157,"He did not want to leave Dumbledore’s side, he did not want to"
18158,move anywhere. Hagrid’s hand on his shoulder was trembling.
18159,"Then another voice said, “Harry, come on.”"
18160,A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was
18161,pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking
18162,about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he
18163,"realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny"
18164,who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices
18165,"battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but"
18166,"Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance"
18167,"hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s vision, people were peering"
18168, 611   
18169,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18170,"at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on"
18171,the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the
18172,marble staircase.
18173,"“We’re going to the hospital wing,” said Ginny."
18174,"“I’m not hurt,” said Harry."
18175,"“It’s McGonagall’s orders,” said Ginny. “Everyone’s up there,"
18176,Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone —”
18177,Fear stirred in Harry’s chest again: He had forgotten the inert
18178,figures he had left behind.
18179,"“Ginny, who else is dead?”"
18180,"“Don’t worry, none of us.”"
18181,“But the Dark Mark — Malfoy said he stepped over a body —”
18182,"“He stepped over Bill, but it’s all right, he’s alive.”"
18183,"There was something in her voice, however, that Harry knew"
18184,boded ill.
18185,“Are you sure?”
18186,"“Of course I’m sure . . . he’s a — a bit of a mess, that’s all. Grey-"
18187,back attacked him. Madam Pomfrey says he won’t — won’t look
18188,the same anymore. . . .”
18189,Ginny’s voice trembled a little.
18190,"“We don’t really know what the aftereffects will be — I mean,"
18191,"Greyback being a werewolf, but not transformed at the time.”"
18192,“But the others . . . There were other bodies on the ground. . . .”
18193,"“Neville and Professor Flitwick are both hurt, but Madam Pom-"
18194,"frey says they’ll be all right. And a Death Eater’s dead, he got hit by"
18195,a Killing Curse that huge blond one was firing off everywhere —
18196,"Harry, if we hadn’t had your Felix potion, I think we’d all have been"
18197,"killed, but everything seemed to just miss us —”"
18198, 612 
18199,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18200,"They had reached the hospital wing. Pushing open the doors,"
18201,"Harry saw Neville lying, apparently asleep, in a bed near the door."
18202,"Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around"
18203,another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors
18204,"opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged"
18205,"him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious."
18206,"“Are you all right, Harry?”"
18207,“I’m fine. . . . How’s Bill?”
18208,Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione’s shoulder and
18209,"saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill’s pillow, so badly slashed"
18210,and ripped that he looked grotesque. Madam Pomfrey was dabbing
18211,at his wounds with some harsh-smelling green ointment. Harry re-
18212,membered how Snape had mended Malfoy’s Sectumsempra wounds
18213,so easily with his wand.
18214,“Can’t you fix them with a charm or something?” he asked the
18215,matron.
18216,"“No charm will work on these,” said Madam Pomfrey. “I’ve tried"
18217,"everything I know, but there is no cure for werewolf bites.”"
18218,"“But he wasn’t bitten at the full moon,” said Ron, who was gaz-"
18219,ing down into his brother’s face as though he could somehow force
18220,"him to mend just by staring. “Greyback hadn’t transformed, so"
18221,surely Bill won’t be a — a real — ?”
18222,He looked uncertainly at Lupin.
18223,"“No, I don’t think that Bill will be a true werewolf,” said Lupin,"
18224,“but that does not mean that there won’t be some contamination.
18225,"Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully,"
18226,and — and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from
18227,now on.”
18228, 613 
18229,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18230,"“Dumbledore might know something that’d work, though,”"
18231,Ron said. “Where is he? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumble-
18232,"dore’s orders, Dumbledore owes him, he can’t leave him in this"
18233,state —”
18234,"“Ron — Dumbledore’s dead,” said Ginny."
18235,"“No!” Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though"
18236,"hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did not,"
18237,"Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill’s bed, his hands over his"
18238,face. Harry had never seen Lupin lose control before; he felt as
18239,"though he was intruding upon something private, indecent. He"
18240,"turned away and caught Ron’s eye instead, exchanging in silence a"
18241,look that confirmed what Ginny had said.
18242,“How did he die?” whispered Tonks. “How did it happen?”
18243,"“Snape killed him,” said Harry. “I was there, I saw it. We arrived"
18244,back on the Astronomy Tower because that’s where the Mark was.
18245,". . . Dumbledore was ill, he was weak, but I think he realized it was"
18246,a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs. He immobi-
18247,"lized me, I couldn’t do anything, I was under the Invisibility"
18248,Cloak — and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed
18249,him —”
18250,Hermione clapped her hands to her mouth and Ron groaned.
18251,Luna’s mouth trembled.
18252,“— more Death Eaters arrived — and then Snape — and Snape
18253,did it. The Avada Kedavra.” Harry couldn’t go on.
18254,Madam Pomfrey burst into tears. Nobody paid her any atten-
18255,"tion except Ginny, who whispered, “Shh! Listen!”"
18256,"Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her"
18257,"eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing"
18258,in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terri-
18259, 614   
18260,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18261,"ble beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song"
18262,"before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own"
18263,grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and
18264,through the castle windows.
18265,"How long they all stood there, listening, he did not know, nor"
18266,why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of
18267,"their mourning, but it felt like a long time later that the hospital"
18268,door opened again and Professor McGonagall entered the ward.
18269,"Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were"
18270,grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.
18271,"“Molly and Arthur are on their way,” she said, and the spell of"
18272,the music was broken: Everyone roused themselves as though com-
18273,"ing out of trances, turning again to look at Bill, or else to rub their"
18274,"own eyes, shake their heads. “Harry, what happened? According to"
18275,Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he — when it
18276,happened. He says Professor Snape was involved in some —”
18277,"“Snape killed Dumbledore,” said Harry."
18278,"She stared at him for a moment, then swayed alarmingly;"
18279,"Madam Pomfrey, who seemed to have pulled herself together, ran"
18280,"forward, conjuring a chair from thin air, which she pushed under"
18281,McGonagall.
18282,"“Snape,” repeated McGonagall faintly, falling into the chair."
18283,“We all wondered . . . but he trusted . . . always . . . Snape . . . I
18284,can’t believe it. . . .”
18285,"“Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens,” said Lupin, his"
18286,voice uncharacteristically harsh. “We always knew that.”
18287,“But Dumbledore swore he was on our side!” whispered Tonks.
18288,“I always thought Dumbledore must know something about Snape
18289,that we didn’t. . . .”
18290, 615   
18291,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18292,“He always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting
18293,"Snape,” muttered Professor McGonagall, now dabbing at the cor-"
18294,ners of her leaking eyes with a tartan-edged handkerchief. “I mean
18295,. . . with Snape’s history . . . of course people were bound to won-
18296,der . . . but Dumbledore told me explicitly that Snape’s repentance
18297,was absolutely genuine. . . . Wouldn’t hear a word against him!”
18298,"“I’d love to know what Snape told him to convince him,” said"
18299,Tonks.
18300,"“I know,” said Harry, and they all turned to look at him. “Snape"
18301,passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt
18302,down my mum and dad. Then Snape told Dumbledore he hadn’t
18303,"realized what he was doing, he was really sorry he’d done it, sorry"
18304,that they were dead.”
18305,They all stared at him.
18306,“And Dumbledore believed that?” said Lupin incredulously.
18307,“Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead? Snape
18308,hated James. . . .”
18309,"“And he didn’t think my mother was worth a damn either,” said"
18310,"Harry, “because she was Muggle-born. . . . ‘Mudblood,’ he called"
18311,her. . . .”
18312,Nobody asked how Harry knew this. All of them seemed to be
18313,"lost in horrified shock, trying to digest the monstrous truth of what"
18314,had happened.
18315,"“This is all my fault,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly. She"
18316,"looked disoriented, twisting her wet handkerchief in her hands."
18317,"“My fault. I sent Filius to fetch Snape tonight, I actually sent for"
18318,him to come and help us! If I hadn’t alerted Snape to what was go-
18319,"ing on, he might never have joined forces with the Death Eaters. I"
18320, 616  
18321,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18322,"don’t think he knew they were there before Filius told him, I don’t"
18323,think he knew they were coming.”
18324,"“It isn’t your fault, Minerva,” said Lupin firmly. “We all wanted"
18325,"more help, we were glad to think Snape was on his way. . . .”"
18326,"“So when he arrived at the fight, he joined in on the Death"
18327,"Eaters’ side?” asked Harry, who wanted every detail of Snape’s du-"
18328,"plicity and infamy, feverishly collecting more reasons to hate him,"
18329,to swear vengeance.
18330,"“I don’t know exactly how it happened,” said Professor McGona-"
18331,gall distractedly. “It’s all so confusing. . . . Dumbledore had told us
18332,that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we
18333,"were to patrol the corridors just in case . . . Remus, Bill, and"
18334,Nymphadora were to join us . . . and so we patrolled. All seemed
18335,quiet. Every secret passageway out of the school was covered. We
18336,knew nobody could fly in. There were powerful enchantments on
18337,every entrance into the castle. I still don’t know how the Death
18338,Eaters can possibly have entered. . . .”
18339,"“I do,” said Harry, and he explained, briefly, about the pair of"
18340,Vanishing Cabinets and the magical pathway they formed. “So
18341,they got in through the Room of Requirement.”
18342,"Almost against his will he glanced from Ron to Hermione, both"
18343,of whom looked devastated.
18344,"“I messed up, Harry,” said Ron bleakly. “We did like you told us:"
18345,"We checked the Marauder’s Map and we couldn’t see Malfoy on it,"
18346,"so we thought he must be in the Room of Requirement, so me,"
18347,"Ginny, and Neville went to keep watch on it . . . but Malfoy got"
18348,past us.”
18349,“He came out of the room about an hour after we started
18350, 617  
18351,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18352,"keeping watch,” said Ginny. “He was on his own, clutching that"
18353,awful shriveled arm —”
18354,"“His Hand of Glory,” said Ron. “Gives light only to the holder,"
18355,remember?”
18356,"“Anyway,” Ginny went on, “he must have been checking"
18357,"whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out, because the"
18358,moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went
18359,pitch-black —”
18360,"“— Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder,” said Ron bitterly. “Fred"
18361,and George’s. I’m going to be having a word with them about who
18362,they let buy their products.”
18363,"“We tried everything, Lumos, Incendio,” said Ginny. “Nothing"
18364,would penetrate the darkness; all we could do was grope our way
18365,"out of the corridor again, and meanwhile we could hear people"
18366,rushing past us. Obviously Malfoy could see because of that hand
18367,"thing and was guiding them, but we didn’t dare use any curses or"
18368,"anything in case we hit each other, and by the time we’d reached a"
18369,"corridor that was light, they’d gone.”"
18370,"“Luckily,” said Lupin hoarsely, “Ron, Ginny, and Neville ran"
18371,into us almost immediately and told us what had happened. We
18372,"found the Death Eaters minutes later, heading in the direction of"
18373,the Astronomy Tower. Malfoy obviously hadn’t expected more peo-
18374,ple to be on the watch; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of
18375,"Darkness Powder, at any rate. A fight broke out, they scattered and"
18376,"we gave chase. One of them, Gibbon, broke away and headed up"
18377,the tower stairs —”
18378,“To set off the Mark?” asked Harry.
18379,"“He must have done, yes, they must have arranged that before"
18380,"they left the Room of Requirement,” said Lupin. “But I don’t think"
18381, 618  
18382,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18383,"Gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for Dumbledore,"
18384,because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and
18385,was hit by a Killing Curse that just missed me.”
18386,“So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny
18387,"and Neville,” said Harry, turning to Hermione, “were you — ?”"
18388,"“Outside Snape’s office, yes,” whispered Hermione, her eyes"
18389,"sparkling with tears, “with Luna. We hung around for ages outside"
18390,it and nothing happened. . . . We didn’t know what was going on
18391,"upstairs, Ron had taken the map. . . . It was nearly midnight when"
18392,Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons. He was
18393,"shouting about Death Eaters in the castle, I don’t think he really"
18394,"registered that Luna and I were there at all, he just burst his way"
18395,into Snape’s office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go
18396,back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape
18397,came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and — and —”
18398,“What?” Harry urged her.
18399,"“I was so stupid, Harry!” said Hermione in a high-pitched whis-"
18400,per. “He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should
18401,go and take care of him while he — while he went to help fight the
18402,Death Eaters —” She covered her face in shame and continued to
18403,"talk into her fingers, so that her voice was muffled. “We went into"
18404,his office to see if we could help Professor Flitwick and found him
18405,"unconscious on the floor . . . and oh, it’s so obvious now, Snape"
18406,"must have Stupefied Flitwick, but we didn’t realize, Harry, we"
18407,"didn’t realize, we just let Snape go!”"
18408,"“It’s not your fault,” said Lupin firmly. “Hermione, had you not"
18409,"obeyed Snape and got out of the way, he probably would have"
18410,killed you and Luna.”
18411,"“So then he came upstairs,” said Harry, who was watching Snape"
18412, 619  
18413,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18414,"running up the marble staircase in his mind’s eye, his black robes"
18415,"billowing behind him as ever, pulling his wand from under his"
18416,"cloak as he ascended, “and he found the place where you were all"
18417,fighting. . . .”
18418,"“We were in trouble, we were losing,” said Tonks in a low voice."
18419,"“Gibbon was down, but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready"
18420,"to fight to the death. Neville had been hurt, Bill had been savaged"
18421,by Greyback . . . It was all dark . . . curses flying everywhere . . .
18422,"The Malfoy boy had vanished, he must have slipped past, up the"
18423,"stairs . . . then more of them ran after him, but one of them"
18424,blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse. . . . Neville
18425,ran at it and got thrown up into the air —”
18426,"“None of us could break through,” said Ron, “and that massive"
18427,"Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place, they were"
18428,bouncing off the walls and barely missing us. . . .”
18429,"“And then Snape was there,” said Tonks, “and then he wasn’t —”"
18430,"“I saw him running toward us, but that huge Death Eater’s jinx"
18431,just missed me right afterward and I ducked and lost track of
18432,"things,” said Ginny."
18433,“I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it
18434,"wasn’t there,” said Lupin. “I tried to follow him, but was thrown"
18435,back just like Neville. . . .”
18436,"“He must have known a spell we didn’t,” whispered McGona-"
18437,gall. “After all — he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.
18438,. . . I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death
18439,Eaters who’d escaped up to the tower. . . .”
18440,"“He was,” said Harry savagely, “but to help them, not to stop"
18441,them . . . and I’ll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through
18442,that barrier — so what happened when he came back down?”
18443, 620  
18444,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18445,"“Well, the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused"
18446,"half the ceiling to fall in, and also broke the curse blocking the"
18447,"stairs,” said Lupin. “We all ran forward — those of us who were"
18448,still standing anyway — and then Snape and the boy emerged out
18449,"of the dust — obviously, none of us attacked them —”"
18450,"“We just let them pass,” said Tonks in a hollow voice. “We"
18451,thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters — and next
18452,"thing, the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were"
18453,"fighting again — I thought I heard Snape shout something, but I"
18454,don’t know what —”
18455,"“He shouted, ‘It’s over,’ ” said Harry. “He’d done what he’d"
18456,meant to do.”
18457,They all fell silent. Fawkes’s lament was still echoing over the
18458,"dark grounds outside. As the music reverberated upon the air, un-"
18459,"bidden, unwelcome thoughts slunk into Harry’s mind. . . . Had"
18460,they taken Dumbledore’s body from the foot of the tower yet?
18461,What would happen to it next? Where would it rest? He clenched
18462,his fists tightly in his pockets. He could feel the small cold lump of
18463,the fake Horcrux against the knuckles of his right hand.
18464,"The doors of the hospital wing burst open, making them all"
18465,"jump: Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were striding up the ward, Fleur just"
18466,"behind them, her beautiful face terrified."
18467,"“Molly — Arthur —” said Professor McGonagall, jumping up"
18468,and hurrying to greet them. “I am so sorry —”
18469,"“Bill,” whispered Mrs. Weasley, darting past Professor McGona-"
18470,"gall as she caught sight of Bill’s mangled face. “Oh, Bill !”"
18471,Lupin and Tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that Mr.
18472,and Mrs. Weasley could get nearer to the bed. Mrs. Weasley bent
18473,over her son and pressed her lips to his bloody forehead.
18474, 621  
18475,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18476,“You said Greyback attacked him?” Mr. Weasley asked Professor
18477,McGonagall distractedly. “But he hadn’t transformed? So what
18478,does that mean? What will happen to Bill?”
18479,"“We don’t yet know,” said Professor McGonagall, looking help-"
18480,lessly at Lupin.
18481,"“There will probably be some contamination, Arthur,” said"
18482,"Lupin. “It is an odd case, possibly unique. . . . We don’t know what"
18483,his behavior might be like when he awakens. . . .”
18484,Mrs. Weasley took the nasty-smelling ointment from Madam
18485,Pomfrey and began dabbing at Bill’s wounds.
18486,"“And Dumbledore . . .” said Mr. Weasley. “Minerva, is it true"
18487,. . . Is he really . . . ?”
18488,"As Professor McGonagall nodded, Harry felt Ginny move beside"
18489,him and looked at her. Her slightly narrowed eyes were fixed upon
18490,"Fleur, who was gazing down at Bill with a frozen expression on her"
18491,face.
18492,"“Dumbledore gone,” whispered Mr. Weasley, but Mrs. Weasley"
18493,"had eyes only for her eldest son; she began to sob, tears falling onto"
18494,Bill’s mutilated face.
18495,"“Of course, it doesn’t matter how he looks. . . . It’s not r-really"
18496,important . . . but he was a very handsome little b-boy . . . always
18497,very handsome . . . and he was g-going to be married!”
18498,“And what do you mean by zat?” said Fleur suddenly and loudly.
18499,"“What do you mean, ‘ ’e was going to be married?’ ”"
18500,"Mrs. Weasley raised her tear-stained face, looking startled."
18501,“Well — only that —”
18502,“You theenk Bill will not wish to marry me anymore?” demanded
18503,"Fleur. “You theenk, because of these bites, he will not love me?”"
18504,"“No, that’s not what I —”"
18505, 622  
18506,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18507,"“Because ’e will!” said Fleur, drawing herself up to her full height"
18508,and throwing back her long mane of silver hair. “It would take
18509,more zan a werewolf to stop Bill loving me!”
18510,"“Well, yes, I’m sure,” said Mrs. Weasley, “but I thought per-"
18511,haps — given how — how he —”
18512,"“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you"
18513,"hoped?” said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he"
18514,"looks? I am good-looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these"
18515,scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she
18516,"added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the oint-"
18517,ment from her.
18518,Mrs. Weasley fell back against her husband and watched Fleur
18519,mopping up Bill’s wounds with a most curious expression upon her
18520,face. Nobody said anything; Harry did not dare move. Like every-
18521,"body else, he was waiting for the explosion."
18522,"“Our Great-Auntie Muriel,” said Mrs. Weasley after a long"
18523,"pause, “has a very beautiful tiara — goblin-made — which I am"
18524,sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding. She is very
18525,"fond of Bill, you know, and it would look lovely with your hair.”"
18526,"“Thank you,” said Fleur stiffly. “I am sure zat will be lovely.”"
18527,"And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both"
18528,women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewil-
18529,"dered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned"
18530,around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione
18531,were exchanging startled looks.
18532,“You see!” said a strained voice. Tonks was glaring at Lupin. “She
18533,"still wants to marry him, even though he’s been bitten! She doesn’t"
18534,care!”
18535,"“It’s different,” said Lupin, barely moving his lips and looking"
18536,  623 
18537,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18538,suddenly tense. “Bill will not be a full werewolf. The cases are com-
18539,pletely —”
18540,"“But I don’t care either, I don’t care!” said Tonks, seizing the"
18541,front of Lupin’s robes and shaking them. “I’ve told you a million
18542,times. . . .”
18543,And the meaning of Tonks’s Patronus and her mouse-colored
18544,"hair, and the reason she had come running to find Dumbledore"
18545,when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by Grey-
18546,"back, all suddenly became clear to Harry; it had not been Sirius"
18547,that Tonks had fallen in love with after all.
18548,"“And I’ve told you a million times,” said Lupin, refusing to meet"
18549,"her eyes, staring at the floor, “that I am too old for you, too poor"
18550,. . . too dangerous. . . .”
18551,"“I’ve said all along you’re taking a ridiculous line on this, Re-"
18552,"mus,” said Mrs. Weasley over Fleur’s shoulder as she patted her on"
18553,the back.
18554,"“I am not being ridiculous,” said Lupin steadily. “Tonks deserves"
18555,somebody young and whole.”
18556,"“But she wants you,” said Mr. Weasley, with a small smile. “And"
18557,"after all, Remus, young and whole men do not necessarily remain"
18558,so.”
18559,"He gestured sadly at his son, lying between them."
18560,"“This is . . . not the moment to discuss it,” said Lupin, avoiding"
18561,everybody’s eyes as he looked around distractedly. “Dumbledore is
18562,dead. . . .”
18563,“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think
18564,"that there was a little more love in the world,” said Professor"
18565,"McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and"
18566,Hagrid walked in.
18567, 624   
18568,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18569,The little of his face that was not obscured by hair or beard was
18570,"soaking and swollen; he was shaking with tears, a vast, spotted"
18571,handkerchief in his hand.
18572,"“I’ve . . . I’ve done it, Professor,” he choked. “M-moved him."
18573,Professor Sprout’s got the kids back in bed. Professor Flitwick’s lyin’
18574,"down, but he says he’ll be all righ’ in a jiffy, an’ Professor Slughorn"
18575,says the Ministry’s bin informed.”
18576,"“Thank you, Hagrid,” said Professor McGonagall, standing up"
18577,at once and turning to look at the group around Bill’s bed. “I shall
18578,"have to see the Ministry when they get here. Hagrid, please tell the"
18579,Heads of Houses — Slughorn can represent Slytherin — that I
18580,want to see them in my office forthwith. I would like you to join us
18581,too.”
18582,"As Hagrid nodded, turned, and shuffled out of the room again,"
18583,she looked down at Harry. “Before I meet them I would like a
18584,"quick word with you, Harry. If you’ll come with me. . . .”"
18585,"Harry stood up, murmured “See you in a bit” to Ron, Hermi-"
18586,"one, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down"
18587,the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound
18588,was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry
18589,became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGona-
18590,"gall’s office, but for Dumbledore’s, and another few seconds before"
18591,"he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress. . . ."
18592,Apparently she was now headmistress . . . so the room behind the
18593,gargoyle was now hers.
18594,In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered
18595,the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the
18596,"room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumble-"
18597,"dore’s body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as"
18598, 625   
18599,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18600,it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previ-
18601,ously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle-
18602,"legged tables, Gryffindor’s sword in its glass case gleaming in the"
18603,"moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk. But"
18604,"Fawkes’s perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the"
18605,grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead head-
18606,masters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slum-
18607,"bering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacles"
18608,"perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled."
18609,"After glancing once at this portrait, Professor McGonagall made"
18610,"an odd movement as though steeling herself, then rounded the"
18611,"desk to look at Harry, her face taut and lined."
18612,"“Harry,” she said, “I would like to know what you and Professor"
18613,Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school.”
18614,"“I can’t tell you that, Professor,” said Harry. He had expected the"
18615,"question and had his answer ready. It had been here, in this very"
18616,"room, that Dumbledore had told him that he was to confide the"
18617,contents of their lessons to nobody but Ron and Hermione.
18618,"“Harry, it might be important,” said Professor McGonagall."
18619,"“It is,” said Harry, “very, but he didn’t want me to tell anyone.”"
18620,Professor McGonagall glared at him. “Potter” — Harry regis-
18621,tered the renewed use of his surname — “in the light of Professor
18622,"Dumbledore’s death, I think you must see that the situation has"
18623,changed somewhat —”
18624,"“I don’t think so,” said Harry, shrugging. “Professor Dumble-"
18625,dore never told me to stop following his orders if he died.”
18626,“But —”
18627,“There’s one thing you should know before the Ministry gets
18628, 626   
18629,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18630,"here, though. Madam Rosmerta’s under the Imperius Curse, she"
18631,"was helping Malfoy and the Death Eaters, that’s how the necklace"
18632,and the poisoned mead —”
18633,"“Rosmerta?” said Professor McGonagall incredulously, but be-"
18634,"fore she could go on, there was a knock on the door behind them"
18635,"and Professors Sprout, Flitwick, and Slughorn traipsed into the"
18636,"room, followed by Hagrid, who was still weeping copiously, his"
18637,huge frame trembling with grief.
18638,"“Snape!” ejaculated Slughorn, who looked the most shaken, pale"
18639,and sweating. “Snape! I taught him! I thought I knew him!”
18640,"But before any of them could respond to this, a sharp voice"
18641,spoke from high on the wall: A sallow-faced wizard with a short
18642,black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas.
18643,"“Minerva, the Minister will be here within seconds, he has just"
18644,Disapparated from the Ministry.”
18645,"“Thank you, Everard,” said Professor McGonagall, and she"
18646,turned quickly to her teachers.
18647,“I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets
18648,"here,” she said quickly. “Personally, I am not convinced that the"
18649,school should reopen next year. The death of the headmaster at the
18650,hands of one of our colleagues is a terrible stain upon Hogwarts’s
18651,history. It is horrible.”
18652,“I am sure Dumbledore would have wanted the school to re-
18653,"main open,” said Professor Sprout. “I feel that if a single pupil"
18654,"wants to come, then the school ought to remain open for that"
18655,pupil.”
18656,"“But will we have a single pupil after this?” said Slughorn, now"
18657,dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief. “Parents will
18658,  627  
18659,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18660,want to keep their children at home and I can’t say I blame them.
18661,"Personally, I don’t think we’re in more danger at Hogwarts than we"
18662,"are anywhere else, but you can’t expect mothers to think like that."
18663,"They’ll want to keep their families together, it’s only natural.”"
18664,"“I agree,” said Professor McGonagall. “And in any case, it is not"
18665,true to say that Dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which
18666,Hogwarts might close. When the Chamber of Secrets reopened he
18667,considered the closure of the school — and I must say that Pro-
18668,fessor Dumbledore’s murder is more disturbing to me than the
18669,idea of Slytherin’s monster living undetected in the bowels of the
18670,castle. . . .”
18671,"“We must consult the governors,” said Professor Flitwick in his"
18672,squeaky little voice; he had a large bruise on his forehead but
18673,seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in Snape’s office. “We
18674,must follow the established procedures. A decision should not be
18675,made hastily.”
18676,"“Hagrid, you haven’t said anything,” said Professor McGonagall."
18677,"“What are your views, ought Hogwarts to remain open?”"
18678,"Hagrid, who had been weeping silently into his large, spotted"
18679,"handkerchief throughout this conversation, now raised puffy red"
18680,"eyes and croaked, “I dunno, Professor . . . that’s fer the Heads of"
18681,House an’ the headmistress ter decide . . .”
18682,"“Professor Dumbledore always valued your views,” said Profes-"
18683,"sor McGonagall kindly, “and so do I.”"
18684,"“Well, I’m stayin’,” said Hagrid, fat tears still leaking out of the"
18685,corners of his eyes and trickling down into his tangled beard. “It’s
18686,"me home, it’s bin me home since I was thirteen. An’ if there’s"
18687,"kids who wan’ me ter teach ’em, I’ll do it. But . . . I dunno . . ."

18689,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18690,Hogwarts without Dumbledore . . .” He gulped and disappeared
18691,"behind his handkerchief once more, and there was silence."
18692,"“Very well,” said Professor McGonagall, glancing out of the win-"
18693,"dow at the grounds, checking to see whether the Minister was yet"
18694,"approaching, “then I must agree with Filius that the right thing to"
18695,"do is to consult the governors, who will make the final decision."
18696,"“Now, as to getting students home . . . there is an argument for"
18697,doing it sooner rather than later. We could arrange for the Hog-
18698,warts Express to come tomorrow if necessary —”
18699,"“What about Dumbledore’s funeral?” said Harry, speaking at"
18700,last.
18701,"“Well . . .” said Professor McGonagall, losing a little of her"
18702,briskness as her voice shook. “I — I know that it was Dumble-
18703,"dore’s wish to be laid to rest here, at Hogwarts —”"
18704,"“Then that’s what’ll happen, isn’t it?” said Harry fiercely."

18707,“No other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this

18709,"“Hogwarts should be Dumbledore’s final resting place,” said"

18711,"“Absolutely,” said Professor Sprout."
18712,"“And in that case,” said Harry, “you shouldn’t send the students"
18713,home until the funeral’s over. They’ll want to say —”
18714,"The last word caught in his throat, but Professor Sprout com-"
18715,pleted the sentence for him.
18716,“Good-bye.”
18717,"“Well said,” squeaked Professor Flitwick. “Well said indeed! Our"

18720,"students should pay tribute, it is fitting. We can arrange transport"
18721,home afterward.”
18722,"“Seconded,” barked Professor Sprout."
18723,"“I suppose . . . yes . . .” said Slughorn in a rather agitated voice,"
18724,while Hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent.
18725,"“He’s coming,” said Professor McGonagall suddenly, gazing"
18726,"down into the grounds. “The Minister . . . and by the looks of it,"
18727,he’s brought a delegation . . .”
18728,"“Can I leave, Professor?” said Harry at once."
18729,"He had no desire at all to see, or be interrogated by, Rufus"
18730,Scrimgeour tonight.
18731,"“You may,” said Professor McGonagall. “And quickly.”"
18732,She strode toward the door and held it open for him. He sped
18733,down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor; he
18734,"had left his Invisibility Cloak at the top of the Astronomy Tower,"
18735,but it did not matter; there was nobody in the corridors to see him
18736,"pass, not even Filch, Mrs. Norris, or Peeves. He did not meet an-"
18737,other soul until he turned into the passage leading to the Gryffin-
18738,dor common room.
18739,“Is it true?” whispered the Fat Lady as he approached her. “It is
18740,really true? Dumbledore — dead?”
18741,"“Yes,” said Harry."
18742,"She let out a wail and, without waiting for the password, swung"
18743,forward to admit him.
18744,"As Harry had suspected it would be, the common room was"
18745,jam-packed. The room fell silent as he climbed through the por-
18746,trait hole. He saw Dean and Seamus sitting in a group nearby: This
18747,"meant that the dormitory must be empty, or nearly so. Without"
18748, 630  
18749,THE PHOENIX LAMENT
18750,"speaking to anybody, without making eye contact at all, Harry"
18751,walked straight across the room and through the door to the boys’
18752,dormitories.
18753,"As he had hoped, Ron was waiting for him, still fully dressed, sit-"
18754,ting on his bed. Harry sat down on his own four-poster and for a
18755,"moment, they simply stared at each other."
18756,"“They’re talking about closing the school,” said Harry."
18757,"“Lupin said they would,” said Ron."
18758,There was a pause.
18759,"“So?” said Ron in a very low voice, as though he thought the fur-"
18760,niture might be listening in. “Did you find one? Did you get it?
18761,A — a Horcrux?”
18762,Harry shook his head. All that had taken place around that black
18763,"lake seemed like an old nightmare now; had it really happened, and"
18764,only hours ago?
18765,"“You didn’t get it?” said Ron, looking crestfallen. “It wasn’t"
18766,there?”
18767,"“No,” said Harry. “Someone had already taken it and left a fake"
18768,in its place.”
18769,“Already taken — ?”
18770,"Wordlessly, Harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket,"
18771,"opened it, and passed it to Ron. The full story could wait. . . . It"
18772,"did not matter tonight . . . nothing mattered except the end, the"
18773,"end of their pointless adventure, the end of Dumbledore’s life. . . ."
18774,"“R.A.B.,” whispered Ron, “but who was that?”"
18775,"“Dunno,” said Harry, lying back on his bed fully clothed and"
18776,staring blankly upwards. He felt no curiosity at all about R.A.B.:
18777,"He doubted that he would ever feel curious again. As he lay there,"
18778, 631   
18779,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
18780,he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent. Fawkes
18781,had stopped singing.
18782,"And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the"
18783,"phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore"
18784,"had left the school, had left the world . . . had left Harry."

18788,"A        ll lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed."
18789,Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by
18790,their parents over the next couple of days — the Patil twins were
18791,gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore’s
18792,"death, and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his"
18793,"haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, re-"
18794,fused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a
18795,shouting match in the entrance hall that was resolved when she
18796,agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had diffi-
18797,"culty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron,"
18798,"for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to"
18799,pay their last respects to Dumbledore.
18800,"Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who"
18801,"had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a"
18802,"house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out"
18803,of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the
18804, 633  
18805,CHAPTER THIRTY
18806,edge of the forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and
18807,"handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the car-"
18808,riage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid’s arms. Mean-
18809,"while a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister of"
18810,"Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry"
18811,"was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that,"
18812,"sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumble-"
18813,dore’s last excursion from Hogwarts.
18814,"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were spending all of their"
18815,time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry
18816,could imagine how it would have been if Dumbledore had not
18817,"died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the"
18818,"year, Ginny’s examinations finished, the pressure of homework"
18819,"lifted . . . and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he"
18820,"knew he must say, doing what he knew was right to do, because it"
18821,was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.
18822,They visited the hospital wing twice a day: Neville had been dis-
18823,"charged, but Bill remained under Madam Pomfrey’s care. His scars"
18824,"were as bad as ever — in truth, he now bore a distinct resemblance"
18825,"to Mad-Eye Moody, though thankfully with both eyes and legs —"
18826,but in personality he seemed just the same as ever. All that ap-
18827,peared to have changed was that he now had a great liking for very
18828,rare steaks.
18829,"“. . . so eet ees lucky ’e is marrying me,” said Fleur happily,"
18830,"plumping up Bill’s pillows, “because ze British overcook their meat,"
18831,I ’ave always said this.”
18832,“I suppose I’m just going to have to accept that he really is going
18833,"to marry her,” sighed Ginny later that evening, as she, Harry, Ron,"
18834, 634  
18835,THE WHITE TOMB
18836,and Hermione sat beside the open window of the Gryffindor com-
18837,"mon room, looking out over the twilit grounds."
18838,"“She’s not that bad,” said Harry. “Ugly, though,” he added"
18839,"hastily, as Ginny raised her eyebrows, and she let out a reluctant"
18840,giggle.
18841,"“Well, I suppose if Mum can stand it, I can.”"
18842,"“Anyone else we know died?” Ron asked Hermione, who was pe-"
18843,rusing the Evening Prophet.
18844,"Hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice. “No,”"
18845,"she said reprovingly, folding up the newspaper. “They’re still look-"
18846,ing for Snape but no sign . . .”
18847,"“Of course there isn’t,” said Harry, who became angry every time"
18848,this subject cropped up. “They won’t find Snape till they find
18849,"Voldemort, and seeing as they’ve never managed to do that in all"
18850,this time . . .”
18851,"“I’m going to go to bed,” yawned Ginny. “I haven’t been sleep-"
18852,ing that well since . . . well . . . I could do with some sleep.”
18853,"She kissed Harry (Ron looked away pointedly), waved at the"
18854,"other two, and departed for the girls’ dormitories. The moment the"
18855,"door had closed behind her, Hermione leaned forward toward"
18856,Harry with a most Hermione-ish look on her face.
18857,"“Harry, I found something out this morning, in the library.”"
18858,"“R.A.B.?” said Harry, sitting up straight."
18859,"He did not feel the way he had so often felt before, excited, curi-"
18860,"ous, burning to get to the bottom of a mystery; he simply knew"
18861,that the task of discovering the truth about the real Horcrux had to
18862,be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark
18863,"and winding path stretching ahead of him, the path that he and"
18864,  635  
18865,CHAPTER THIRTY
18866,"Dumbledore had set out upon together, and which he now knew"
18867,he would have to journey alone. There might still be as many as
18868,"four Horcruxes out there somewhere, and each would need to be"
18869,found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Volde-
18870,"mort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as"
18871,though by listing them he could bring them within reach: the locket
18872,. . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s or Ravenclaw’s
18873,. . . the locket . . . the cup . . . the snake . . . something of Gryffindor’s
18874,or Ravenclaw’s . . .
18875,This mantra seemed to pulse through Harry’s mind as he fell
18876,"asleep at night, and his dreams were thick with cups, lockets, and"
18877,"mysterious objects that he could not quite reach, though Dumble-"
18878,dore helpfully offered Harry a rope ladder that turned to snakes the
18879,moment he began to climb. . . .
18880,He had shown Hermione the note inside the locket the morning
18881,"after Dumbledore’s death, and although she had not immediately"
18882,recognized the initials as belonging to some obscure wizard about
18883,"whom she had been reading, she had since been rushing off to the"
18884,library a little more often than was strictly necessary for somebody
18885,who had no homework to do.
18886,"“No,” she said sadly, “I’ve been trying, Harry, but I haven’t"
18887,found anything. . . . There are a couple of reasonably well-known
18888,wizards with those initials — Rosalind Antigone Bungs . . . Rupert
18889,‘Axebanger’ Brookstanton . . . but they don’t seem to fit at all.
18890,"Judging by that note, the person who stole the Horcrux knew"
18891,"Voldemort, and I can’t find a shred of evidence that Bungs or Axe-"
18892,"banger ever had anything to do with him. . . . No, actually, it’s"
18893,"about . . . well, Snape.”"
18894,She looked nervous even saying the name again.
18895, 636  
18896,THE WHITE TOMB
18897,"“What about him?” asked Harry heavily, slumping back in his"
18898,chair.
18899,"“Well, it’s just that I was sort of right about the Half-Blood"
18900,"Prince business,” she said tentatively."
18901,"“D’you have to rub it in, Hermione? How d’you think I feel"
18902,about that now?”
18903,"“No — no — Harry, I didn’t mean that!” she said hastily, look-"
18904,ing around to check that they were not being overheard. “It’s just
18905,that I was right about Eileen Prince once owning the book. You see
18906,. . . she was Snape’s mother!”
18907,"“I thought she wasn’t much of a looker,” said Ron. Hermione ig-"
18908,nored him.
18909,“I was going through the rest of the old Prophets and there was a
18910,tiny announcement about Eileen Prince marrying a man called
18911,"Tobias Snape, and then later an announcement saying that she’d"
18912,given birth to a —”
18913,"“— murderer,” spat Harry."
18914,"“Well . . . yes,” said Hermione. “So . . . I was sort of right."
18915,"Snape must have been proud of being ‘half a Prince,’ you see?"
18916,Tobias Snape was a Muggle from what it said in the Prophet.”
18917,"“Yeah, that fits,” said Harry. “He’d play up the pure-blood side"
18918,so he could get in with Lucius Malfoy and the rest of them. . . .
18919,"He’s just like Voldemort. Pure-blood mother, Muggle father . . ."
18920,"ashamed of his parentage, trying to make himself feared using the"
18921,"Dark Arts, gave himself an impressive new name — Lord Volde-"
18922,mort — the Half-Blood Prince — how could Dumbledore have
18923,missed — ?”
18924,"He broke off, looking out the window. He could not stop him-"
18925,self dwelling upon Dumbledore’s inexcusable trust in Snape . . .
18926, 637  
18927,CHAPTER THIRTY
18928,"but as Hermione had just inadvertently reminded him, he, Harry,"
18929,had been taken in just the same. . . . In spite of the increasing nas-
18930,"tiness of those scribbled spells, he had refused to believe ill of the"
18931,"boy who had been so clever, who had helped him so much. . . ."
18932,Helped him . . . it was an almost unendurable thought now.
18933,"“I still don’t get why he didn’t turn you in for using that book,”"
18934,said Ron. “He must’ve known where you were getting it all from.”
18935,"“He knew,” said Harry bitterly. “He knew when I used Sectum-"
18936,sempra. He didn’t really need Legilimency. . . . He might even have
18937,"known before then, with Slughorn talking about how brilliant I"
18938,was at Potions. . . . Shouldn’t have left his old book in the bottom
18939,"of that cupboard, should he?”"
18940,“But why didn’t he turn you in?”
18941,"“I don’t think he wanted to associate himself with that book,”"
18942,said Hermione. “I don’t think Dumbledore would have liked it
18943,very much if he’d known. And even if Snape pretended it hadn’t
18944,"been his, Slughorn would have recognized his writing at once."
18945,"Anyway, the book was left in Snape’s old classroom, and I’ll bet"
18946,Dumbledore knew his mother was called ‘Prince.’ ”
18947,"“I should’ve shown the book to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “All"
18948,that time he was showing me how Voldemort was evil even when
18949,"he was at school, and I had proof Snape was too —”"
18950,"“ ‘Evil’ is a strong word,” said Hermione quietly."
18951,“You were the one who kept telling me the book was dan-
18952,gerous!”
18953,"“I’m trying to say, Harry, that you’re putting too much blame on"
18954,yourself. I thought the Prince seemed to have a nasty sense of hu-
18955,"mor, but I would never have guessed he was a potential killer. . . .”"

18957,THE WHITE TOMB
18958,"“None of us could’ve guessed Snape would . . . you know,” said"
18959,Ron.
18960,"Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own"
18961,"thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking"
18962,"about the following morning, when Dumbledore’s body would be"
18963,laid to rest. He had never attended a funeral before; there had been
18964,no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to ex-
18965,"pect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he"
18966,would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledore’s death would be
18967,more real to him once it was over. Though he had moments when
18968,"the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were"
18969,"blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody"
18970,"was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it"
18971,difficult to believe that Dumbledore had really gone. Admittedly he
18972,"had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of"
18973,"loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back. . . . He"
18974,"felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he"
18975,"now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a re-"
18976,minder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.
18977,Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express
18978,"would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Downstairs, he found"
18979,the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Everybody was wearing their
18980,dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall
18981,had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty.
18982,Hagrid’s chair was deserted too; Harry thought that perhaps he had
18983,"not been able to face breakfast, but Snape’s place had been uncere-"
18984,moniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish
18985,eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling
18986, 639  
18987,CHAPTER THIRTY
18988,that Scrimgeour was looking for him. Among Scrimgeour’s en-
18989,tourage Harry spotted the red hair and horn-rimmed glasses of
18990,"Percy Weasley. Ron gave no sign that he was aware of Percy, apart"
18991,from stabbing pieces of kipper with unwonted venom.
18992,Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering
18993,"together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely"
18994,"without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them"
18995,around. Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animos-
18996,"ity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy’s"
18997,"voice on that tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand"
18998,before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that
18999,Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still
19000,"for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of"
19001,"pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy"
19002,"now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of"
19003,killing him and his parents?
19004,Harry’s thoughts were interrupted by a nudge in the ribs from
19005,"Ginny. Professor McGonagall had risen to her feet, and the mourn-"
19006,ful hum in the Hall died away at once.
19007,"“It is nearly time,” she said. “Please follow your Heads of Houses"
19008,"out into the grounds. Gryffindors, after me.”"
19009,They filed out from behind their benches in near silence. Harry
19010,"glimpsed Slughorn at the head of the Slytherin column, wearing"
19011,"magnificent, long, emerald green robes embroidered with silver."
19012,"He had never seen Professor Sprout, Head of the Hufflepuffs, look-"
19013,"ing so clean; there was not a single patch on her hat, and when they"
19014,"reached the entrance hall, they found Madam Pince standing be-"
19015,"side Filch, she in a thick black veil that fell to her knees, he in an"
19016,ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothballs.

19018,THE WHITE TOMB
19019,"They were heading, as Harry saw when he stepped out onto the"
19020,"stone steps from the front doors, toward the lake. The warmth of"
19021,the sun caressed his face as they followed Professor McGonagall in
19022,silence to the place where hundreds of chairs had been set out in
19023,rows. An aisle ran down the center of them: There was a marble
19024,"table standing at the front, all chairs facing it. It was the most beau-"
19025,tiful summer’s day.
19026,An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into
19027,"half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry"
19028,"did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Or-"
19029,"der of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks,"
19030,"her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin,"
19031,with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs.
19032,"Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George,"
19033,who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was
19034,"Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own;"
19035,"Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella"
19036,"Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wiz-"
19037,"arding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight"
19038,"Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some"
19039,"people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of"
19040,the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hog-
19041,"warts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the"
19042,"bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering in-"
19043,substantially on the gleaming air.
19044,"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a"
19045,row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it
19046,"sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by"
19047,far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection
19048, 641   
19049,CHAPTER THIRTY
19050,"for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by"
19051,Luna. Neville and Luna alone of the D.A. had responded to Her-
19052,"mione’s summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry"
19053,knew why: They were the ones who had missed the D.A. most . . .
19054,probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the
19055,hope that there would be another meeting.
19056,"Cornelius Fudge walked past toward the front rows, his expres-"
19057,"sion miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next"
19058,"recognized Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a note-"
19059,"book clutched in her red-taloned hand, and then, with a worse jolt"
19060,"of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief"
19061,"upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-colored"
19062,"curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a"
19063,"sentinel near the water’s edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily"
19064,into a seat a good distance away.
19065,The staff was seated at last. Harry could see Scrimgeour looking
19066,grave and dignified in the front row with Professor McGonagall.
19067,He wondered whether Scrimgeour or any of these important peo-
19068,ple were really sorry that Dumbledore was dead. But then he heard
19069,"music, strange, otherworldly music, and he forgot his dislike of the"
19070,Ministry in looking around for the source of it. He was not the
19071,"only one: Many heads were turning, searching, a little alarmed."
19072,"“In there,” whispered Ginny in Harry’s ear."
19073,"And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the"
19074,"surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi: a chorus of mer-"
19075,"people singing in a strange language he did not understand, their"
19076,"pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them."
19077,"The music made the hair on Harry’s neck stand up, and yet it was"
19078,not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he
19079, 642  
19080,THE WHITE TOMB
19081,"looked down into the wild faces of the singers, he had the feeling"
19082,"that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore’s passing. Then"
19083,Ginny nudged him again and he looked around.
19084,Hagrid was walking slowly up the aisle between the chairs. He
19085,"was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his"
19086,"arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was"
19087,what Harry knew to be Dumbledore’s body. A sharp pain rose in
19088,"Harry’s throat at this sight: For a moment, the strange music and"
19089,the knowledge that Dumbledore’s body was so close seemed to take
19090,all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears
19091,were falling thick and fast into both Ginny’s and Hermione’s laps.
19092,They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Ha-
19093,grid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now
19094,"he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting"
19095,"noises that drew scandalized looks from some, including, Harry"
19096,"saw, Dolores Umbridge . . . but Harry knew that Dumbledore"
19097,would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Ha-
19098,"grid as he passed, but Hagrid’s eyes were so swollen it was a wonder"
19099,he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to
19100,"which Hagrid was heading and realized what was guiding him, for"
19101,"there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small mar-"
19102,"quee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulderlike head bowed,"
19103,"docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother,"
19104,"and Grawp patted Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs"
19105,sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to
19106,"laugh. But then the music stopped, and he turned to face the front"
19107,again.
19108,A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet
19109,and stood now in front of Dumbledore’s body. Harry could not
19110, 643  
19111,CHAPTER THIRTY
19112,hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the
19113,hundreds of heads. “Nobility of spirit” . . . “intellectual contribu-
19114,tion” . . . “greatness of heart” . . . It did not mean very much. It had
19115,little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He sud-
19116,"denly remembered Dumbledore’s idea of a few words, “nitwit,”"
19117,"“oddment,” “blubber,” and “tweak,” and again had to suppress a"
19118,grin. . . . What was the matter with him?
19119,There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the
19120,merpeople had broken the surface to listen too. He remembered
19121,"Dumbledore crouching at the water’s edge two years ago, very close"
19122,"to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Mer-"
19123,chieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned
19124,"Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he"
19125,should have said. . . .
19126,"And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful"
19127,"truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now."
19128,"Dumbledore was dead, gone. . . . He clutched the cold locket in"
19129,"his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears"
19130,spilling from his eyes: He looked away from Ginny and the others
19131,"and stared out over the lake, toward the forest, as the little man in"
19132,black droned on. . . . There was movement among the trees. The
19133,centaurs had come to pay their respects too. They did not move
19134,"into the open but Harry saw them standing quite still, half hidden"
19135,"in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides."
19136,"And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest,"
19137,the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then
19138,"Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumble-"
19139,dore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It
19140,  644    
19141,THE WHITE TOMB
19142,"was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and"
19143,"keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never"
19144,quite eradicated. . . .
19145,And Harry saw very clearly as he sat there under the hot sun how
19146,"people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one,"
19147,"his mother, his father, his godfather, and finally Dumbledore, all"
19148,determined to protect him; but now that was over. He could not let
19149,anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon
19150,"forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one, that the"
19151,shelter of a parent’s arms meant that nothing could hurt him.
19152,"There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper"
19153,"in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination;"
19154,"the last and greatest of his protectors had died, and he was more"
19155,alone than he had ever been before.
19156,The little man in black had stopped speaking at last and re-
19157,sumed his seat. Harry waited for somebody else to get to their feet;
19158,"he expected speeches, probably from the Minister, but nobody"
19159,moved.
19160,"Then several people screamed. Bright, white flames had erupted"
19161,around Dumbledore’s body and the table upon which it lay:
19162,"Higher and higher they rose, obscuring the body. White smoke"
19163,"spiraled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for"
19164,"one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into"
19165,"the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a"
19166,"white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore’s body and the table on"
19167,which he had rested.
19168,There were a few more cries of shock as a shower of arrows
19169,"soared through the air, but they fell far short of the crowd. It was,"
19170,  645   
19171,CHAPTER THIRTY
19172,"Harry knew, the centaurs’ tribute: He saw them turn tail and dis-"
19173,"appear back into the cool trees. Likewise, the merpeople sank"
19174,slowly back into the green water and were lost from view.
19175,"Harry looked at Ginny, Ron, and Hermione: Ron’s face was"
19176,screwed up as though the sunlight were blinding him. Hermione’s
19177,"face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying. She"
19178,"met Harry’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen"
19179,when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his
19180,"absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each"
19181,"other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do"
19182,"now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but accept"
19183,"his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of"
19184,him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must
19185,say ever since Dumbledore had died.
19186,"“Ginny, listen . . .” he said very quietly, as the buzz of conversa-"
19187,"tion grew louder around them and people began to get to their feet,"
19188,“I can’t be involved with you anymore. We’ve got to stop seeing
19189,each other. We can’t be together.”
19190,"She said, with an oddly twisted smile, “It’s for some stupid, no-"
19191,"ble reason, isn’t it?”"
19192,"“It’s been like . . . like something out of someone else’s life, these"
19193,"last few weeks with you,” said Harry. “But I can’t . . . we can’t . . ."
19194,I’ve got things to do alone now.”
19195,"She did not cry, she simply looked at him."
19196,“Voldemort uses people his enemies are close to. He’s already
19197,"used you as bait once, and that was just because you’re my best"
19198,friend’s sister. Think how much danger you’ll be in if we keep this
19199,"up. He’ll know, he’ll find out. He’ll try and get to me through you.”"
19200,“What if I don’t care?” said Ginny fiercely.
19201, 646  
19202,THE WHITE TOMB
19203,"“I care,” said Harry. “How do you think I’d feel if this was your"
19204,funeral . . . and it was my fault. . . .”
19205,"She looked away from him, over the lake."
19206,"“I never really gave up on you,” she said. “Not really. I always"
19207,"hoped. . . . Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out"
19208,"with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never"
19209,"used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she"
19210,thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more —
19211,myself.”
19212,"“Smart girl, that Hermione,” said Harry, trying to smile. “I just"
19213,wish I’d asked you sooner. We could’ve had ages . . . months . . .
19214,years maybe. . . .”
19215,"“But you’ve been too busy saving the Wizarding world,” said"
19216,"Ginny, half laughing. “Well . . . I can’t say I’m surprised. I knew"
19217,this would happen in the end. I knew you wouldn’t be happy un-
19218,less you were hunting Voldemort. Maybe that’s why I like you so
19219,much.”
19220,"Harry could not bear to hear these things, nor did he think his"
19221,"resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her. Ron, he"
19222,"saw, was now holding Hermione and stroking her hair while she"
19223,"sobbed into his shoulder, tears dripping from the end of his own"
19224,"long nose. With a miserable gesture, Harry got up, turned his back"
19225,"on Ginny and on Dumbledore’s tomb, and walked away around"
19226,"the lake. Moving felt much more bearable than sitting still, just as"
19227,setting out as soon as possible to track down the Horcruxes and kill
19228,Voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it. . . .
19229,“Harry!”
19230,He turned. Rufus Scrimgeour was limping rapidly toward him
19231,"around the bank, leaning on his walking stick."
19232,  647     
19233,CHAPTER THIRTY
19234,“I’ve been hoping to have a word . . . do you mind if I walk a lit-
19235,tle way with you?”
19236,"“No,” said Harry indifferently, and set off again."
19237,"“Harry, this was a dreadful tragedy,” said Scrimgeour quietly. “I"
19238,cannot tell you how appalled I was to hear of it. Dumbledore was
19239,"a very great wizard. We had our disagreements, as you know, but"
19240,no one knows better than I —”
19241,“What do you want?” asked Harry flatly.
19242,"Scrimgeour looked annoyed, but as before, hastily modified his"
19243,expression to one of sorrowful understanding.
19244,"“You are, of course, devastated,” he said. “I know that you were"
19245,very close to Dumbledore. I think you may have been his favorite
19246,pupil ever. The bond between the two of you —”
19247,"“What do you want?” Harry repeated, coming to a halt."
19248,"Scrimgeour stopped too, leaned on his stick, and stared at Harry,"
19249,his expression shrewd now.
19250,“The word is that you were with him when he left the school the
19251,night that he died.”
19252,“Whose word?” said Harry.
19253,“Somebody Stupefied a Death Eater on top of the tower after
19254,Dumbledore died. There were also two broomsticks up there. The
19255,"Ministry can add two and two, Harry.”"
19256,"“Glad to hear it,” said Harry. “Well, where I went with Dum-"
19257,bledore and what we did is my business. He didn’t want people to
19258,know.”
19259,"“Such loyalty is admirable, of course,” said Scrimgeour, who"
19260,"seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty, “but Dum-"
19261,"bledore is gone, Harry. He’s gone.”"
19262, 648  
19263,THE WHITE TOMB
19264,“He will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal
19265,"to him,” said Harry, smiling in spite of himself."
19266,“My dear boy . . . even Dumbledore cannot return from the —”
19267,“I am not saying he can. You wouldn’t understand. But I’ve got
19268,nothing to tell you.”
19269,"Scrimgeour hesitated, then said, in what was evidently supposed"
19270,"to be a tone of delicacy, “The Ministry can offer you all sorts of"
19271,"protection, you know, Harry. I would be delighted to place a cou-"
19272,ple of my Aurors at your service —”
19273,"Harry laughed. “Voldemort wants to kill me himself, and Aurors"
19274,"won’t stop him. So thanks for the offer, but no thanks.”"
19275,"“So,” said Scrimgeour, his voice cold now, “the request I made of"
19276,you at Christmas —”
19277,“What request? Oh yeah . . . the one where I tell the world what
19278,a great job you’re doing in exchange for —”
19279,“— for raising everyone’s morale!” snapped Scrimgeour.
19280,Harry considered him for a moment.
19281,“Released Stan Shunpike yet?”
19282,Scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of
19283,Uncle Vernon.
19284,“I see you are —”
19285,"“Dumbledore’s man through and through,” said Harry. “That’s"
19286,right.”
19287,"Scrimgeour glared at him for another moment, then turned and"
19288,limped away without another word. Harry could see Percy and the
19289,"rest of the Ministry delegation waiting for him, casting nervous"
19290,"glances at the sobbing Hagrid and Grawp, who were still in their"
19291,"seats. Ron and Hermione were hurrying toward Harry, passing"
19292, 649   
19293,CHAPTER THIRTY
19294,Scrimgeour going in the opposite direction. Harry turned and
19295,"walked slowly on, waiting for them to catch up, which they finally"
19296,did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in hap-
19297,pier times.
19298,“What did Scrimgeour want?” Hermione whispered.
19299,"“Same as he wanted at Christmas,” shrugged Harry. “Wanted"
19300,me to give him inside information on Dumbledore and be the
19301,Ministry’s new poster boy.”
19302,"Ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment, then he said"
19303,"loudly to Hermione, “Look, let me go back and hit Percy!”"
19304,"“No,” she said firmly, grabbing his arm."
19305,“It’ll make me feel better!”
19306,"Harry laughed. Even Hermione grinned a little, though her"
19307,smile faded as she looked up at the castle.
19308,"“I can’t bear the idea that we might never come back,” she said"
19309,softly. “How can Hogwarts close?”
19310,"“Maybe it won’t,” said Ron. “We’re not in any more danger here"
19311,"than we are at home, are we? Everywhere’s the same now. I’d even"
19312,"say Hogwarts is safer, there are more wizards inside to defend the"
19313,"place. What d’you reckon, Harry?”"
19314,"“I’m not coming back even if it does reopen,” said Harry."
19315,"Ron gaped at him, but Hermione said sadly, “I knew you were"
19316,going to say that. But then what will you do?”
19317,"“I’m going back to the Dursleys’ once more, because Dumble-"
19318,"dore wanted me to,” said Harry. “But it’ll be a short visit, and then"
19319,I’ll be gone for good.”
19320,“But where will you go if you don’t come back to school?”
19321,"“I thought I might go back to Godric’s Hollow,” Harry mut-"
19322,tered. He had had the idea in his head ever since the night of
19323, 650 
19324,THE WHITE TOMB
19325,"Dumbledore’s death. “For me, it started there, all of it. I’ve just got"
19326,"a feeling I need to go there. And I can visit my parents’ graves, I’d"
19327,like that.”
19328,“And then what?” said Ron.
19329,"“Then I’ve got to track down the rest of the Horcruxes, haven’t"
19330,"I?” said Harry, his eyes upon Dumbledore’s white tomb, reflected"
19331,in the water on the other side of the lake. “That’s what he wanted
19332,"me to do, that’s why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was"
19333,right — and I’m sure he was — there are still four of them out
19334,"there. I’ve got to find them and destroy them, and then I’ve got to"
19335,"go after the seventh bit of Voldemort’s soul, the bit that’s still in his"
19336,"body, and I’m the one who’s going to kill him. And if I meet"
19337,"Severus Snape along the way,” he added, “so much the better for"
19338,"me, so much the worse for him.”"
19339,"There was a long silence. The crowd had almost dispersed now,"
19340,the stragglers giving the monumental figure of Grawp a wide berth
19341,"as he cuddled Hagrid, whose howls of grief were still echoing across"
19342,the water.
19343,"“We’ll be there, Harry,” said Ron."
19344,“What?”
19345,"“At your aunt and uncle’s house,” said Ron. “And then we’ll go"
19346,with you wherever you’re going.”
19347,"“No —” said Harry quickly; he had not counted on this, he had"
19348,meant them to understand that he was undertaking this most dan-
19349,gerous journey alone.
19350,"“You said to us once before,” said Hermione quietly, “that there"
19351,"was time to turn back if we wanted to. We’ve had time, haven’t"
19352,we?
19353,"“We’re with you whatever happens,” said Ron. “But mate, you’re"
19354, 651  
19355,CHAPTER THIRTY
19356,going to have to come round my mum and dad’s house before we
19357,"do anything else, even Godric’s Hollow.”"
19358,“Why?”
19359,"“Bill and Fleur’s wedding, remember?”"
19360,"Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal"
19361,as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful.
19362,"“Yeah, we shouldn’t miss that,” he said finally."
19363,"His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in"
19364,"spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw"
19365,"stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with"
19366,"Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or"
19367,"in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one"
19368,last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.
