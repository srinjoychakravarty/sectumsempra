177,ASCENDING
178,"T       he two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in"
179,"the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still,"
180,"wands directed at each other’s chests; then, recognizing each other,"
181,they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking
182,briskly in the same direction.
183,“News?” asked the taller of the two.
184,"“The best,” replied Severus Snape."
185,"The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles,"
186,"on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men’s long"
187,cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.
188,"“Thought I might be late,” said Yaxley, his blunt features slid-"
189,ing in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke
190,the moonlight. “It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope
191,he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will
192,be good?”
193,"Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a"
194,  1  
195,CHAPTER ONE
196,wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with
197,"them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive"
198,wrought-iron gates barring the men’s way. Neither of them broke
199,step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and
200,"passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke."
201,The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men’s footsteps. There
202,"was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again,"
203,"pointing it over his companion’s head, but the source of the noise"
204,"proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting"
205,majestically along the top of the hedge.
206,"“He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks . . .” Yaxley thrust"
207,his wand back under his cloak with a snort.
208,A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of
209,"the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs"
210,windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a foun-
211,tain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and
212,"Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their"
213,"approach, though nobody had visibly opened it."
214,"The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated,"
215,with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes
216,of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley
217,as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door
218,"leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat,"
219,then Snape turned the bronze handle.
220,"The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and"
221,ornate table. The room’s usual furniture had been pushed carelessly
222,up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath
223,a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror.
224,Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their
225, 2 
226,THE DARK LORD
227,ASCENDING
228,"eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward"
229,to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious hu-
230,"man figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as"
231,"if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and"
232,"in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people"
233,seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a
234,pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable
235,to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.
236,"“Yaxley. Snape,” said a high, clear voice from the head of the table."
237,“You are very nearly late.”
238,"The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that"
239,"it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than"
240,"his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through"
241,"the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming"
242,red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed
243,to emit a pearly glow.
244,"“Severus, here,” said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his im-"
245,mediate right. “Yaxley — beside Dolohov.”
246,The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around
247,"the table followed Snape, and it was to him that Voldemort spoke"
248,first.
249,“So?”
250,"“My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Pot-"
251,"ter from his current place of safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.”"
252,"The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened,"
253,"others fidgeted, all gazing at Snape and Voldemort."
254,"“Saturday . . . at nightfall,” repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fas-"
255,tened upon Snape’s black ones with such intensity that some of the
256,"watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would"
257, 3 
258,CHAPTER ONE
259,"be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked"
260,"calmly back into Voldemort’s face and, after a moment or two, Vol-"
261,demort’s lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.
262,“Good. Very good. And this information comes —”
263,"“— from the source we discussed,” said Snape."
264,“My Lord.”
265,Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Volde-
266,mort and Snape. All faces turned to him.
267,"“My Lord, I have heard differently.”"
268,"Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on,"
269,"“Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the"
270,"thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.”"
271,Snape was smiling.
272,“My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must
273,be it. No doubt a Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish.
274,It would not be the first time; he is known to be susceptible.”
275,"“I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,” said"
276,Yaxley.
277,"“If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,” said Snape."
278,"“I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in"
279,the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have
280,infiltrated the Ministry.”
281,"“The Order’s got one thing right, then, eh?” said a squat man sit-"
282,ting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was
283,echoed here and there along the table.
284,Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to
285,"the body revolving slowly overhead, and he seemed to be lost in"
286,thought.
287, 4  
288,THE DARK LORD
289,ASCENDING
290,"“My Lord,” Yaxley went on, “Dawlish believes an entire party of"
291,Aurors will be used to transfer the boy —”
292,"Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at"
293,"once, watching resentfully as Voldemort turned back to Snape."
294,“Where are they going to hide the boy next?”
295,"“At the home of one of the Order,” said Snape. “The place, accord-"
296,"ing to the source, has been given every protection that the Order"
297,and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little
298,"chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course,"
299,"the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us"
300,the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments
301,to break through the rest.”
302,"“Well, Yaxley?” Voldemort called down the table, the firelight"
303,glinting strangely in his red eyes. “Will the Ministry have fallen by
304,next Saturday?”
305,"Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders."
306,"“My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have — with dif-"
307,"ficulty, and after great effort — suceeded in placing an Imperius"
308,Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.”
309,Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neigh-
310,"bor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the"
311,back.
312,"“It is a start,” said Voldemort. “But Thicknesse is only one man."
313,Scrimgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One
314,failed attempt on the Minister’s life will set me back a long way.”
315,"“Yes — my Lord, that is true — but you know, as Head of the"
316,"Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular"
317,"contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads"
318,  5 
319,CHAPTER ONE
320,"of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now"
321,"that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to"
322,"subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring"
323,Scrimgeour down.”
324,“As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has
325,"converted the rest,” said Voldemort. “At any rate, it remains"
326,unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we
327,"cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while"
328,he travels.”
329,"“We are at an advantage there, my Lord,” said Yaxley, who seemed"
330,determined to receive some portion of approval. “We now have
331,several people planted within the Department of Magical Trans-
332,"port. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know"
333,immediately.”
334,"“He will not do either,” said Snape. “The Order is eschewing any"
335,form of transport that is controlled or regulated by the Ministry;
336,they mistrust everything to do with the place.”
337,"“All the better,” said Voldemort. “He will have to move in the"
338,"open. Easier to take, by far.”"
339,"Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he"
340,"went on, “I shall attend to the boy in person. There have been too"
341,many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them
342,have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than
343,to his triumphs.”
344,The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehen-
345,"sively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might"
346,"be blamed for Harry Potter’s continued existence. Voldemort, how-"
347,"ever, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them,"
348,still addressing the unconscious body above him.
349, 6 
350,THE DARK LORD
351,ASCENDING
352,"“I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and"
353,"chance, those wreckers of all but the best-laid plans. But I know bet-"
354,ter now. I understand those things that I did not understand before.
355,"I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.”"
356,"At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail"
357,"sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry of misery and pain. Many of"
358,"those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had"
359,seemed to issue from below their feet.
360,"“Wormtail,” said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet,"
361,"thoughtful tone, and without removing his eyes from the revolving"
362,"body above, “have I not spoken to you about keeping our prisoner"
363,quiet?”
364,"“Yes, m-my Lord,” gasped a small man halfway down the table,"
365,"who had been sitting so low in his chair that it had appeared, at"
366,"first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and"
367,"scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious"
368,gleam of silver.
369,"“As I was saying,” continued Voldemort, looking again at the"
370,"tense faces of his followers, “I understand better now. I shall need,"
371,"for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to kill"
372,Potter.”
373,The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have
374,announced that he wanted to borrow one of their arms.
375,"“No volunteers?” said Voldemort. “Let’s see . . . Lucius, I see no"
376,reason for you to have a wand anymore.”
377,Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy
378,"in the firelight, and his eyes were sunken and shadowed. When he"
379,"spoke, his voice was hoarse."
380,“My Lord?”
381, 7 
382,CHAPTER ONE
383,"“Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.”"
384,“I . . .”
385,Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight
386,"ahead, quite as pale as he was, her long blonde hair hanging down"
387,"her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly on his"
388,"wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew"
389,"a wand, and passed it along to Voldemort, who held it up in front"
390,"of his red eyes, examining it closely."
391,“What is it?”
392,"“Elm, my Lord,” whispered Malfoy."
393,“And the core?”
394,“Dragon — dragon heartstring.”
395,"“Good,” said Voldemort. He drew out his own wand and com-"
396,pared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made an involuntary movement;
397,"for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Volde-"
398,mort’s wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed
399,"by Voldemort, whose eyes widened maliciously."
400,"“Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?”"
401,Some of the throng sniggered.
402,"“I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for"
403,you? But I have noticed that you and your family seem less than
404,happy of late. . . . What is it about my presence in your home that
405,"displeases you, Lucius?”"
406,"“Nothing — nothing, my Lord!”"
407,"“Such lies, Lucius . . .”"
408,The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had
409,stopped moving. One or two of the wizards barely repressed a shud-
410,der as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard
411,sliding across the floor beneath the table.
412, 8 
413,THE DARK LORD
414,ASCENDING
415,The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort’s chair.
416,"It rose, seemingly endlessly, and came to rest across Voldemort’s"
417,"shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man’s thigh; its eyes, with their"
418,"vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature"
419,"absently with long thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy."
420,“Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot? Is my re-
421,"turn, my rise to power, not the very thing they professed to desire"
422,for so many years?”
423,"“Of course, my Lord,” said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he"
424,wiped sweat from his upper lip. “We did desire it — we do.”
425,"To Malfoy’s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted"
426,"from Voldemort and the snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who"
427,"had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced quickly at"
428,"Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact."
429,"“My Lord,” said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice"
430,"constricted with emotion, “it is an honor to have you here, in our"
431,family’s house. There can be no higher pleasure.”
432,"She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair"
433,"and heavily lidded eyes, as she was in bearing and demeanor; where"
434,"Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward Voldemort,"
435,for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness.
436,"“No higher pleasure,” repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little"
437,"to one side as he considered Bellatrix. “That means a great deal,"
438,"Bellatrix, from you.”"
439,Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of
440,delight.
441,“My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!”
442,“No higher pleasure . . . even compared with the happy event
443,"that, I hear, has taken place in your family this week?”"
444, 9 
445,CHAPTER ONE
446,"She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused."
447,"“I don’t know what you mean, my Lord.”"
448,"“I’m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and"
449,"Narcissa. She has just married the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You"
450,must be so proud.”
451,There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table.
452,Many leaned forward to exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped
453,"the table with their fists. The great snake, disliking the disturbance,"
454,"opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did"
455,"not hear it, so jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys’ hu-"
456,"miliation. Bellatrix’s face, so recently flushed with happiness, had"
457,"turned an ugly, blotchy red."
458,"“She is no niece of ours, my Lord,” she cried over the outpouring"
459,of mirth. “We — Narcissa and I — have never set eyes on our sister
460,since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do with
461,"either of us, nor any beast she marries.”"
462,"“What say you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, and though his voice"
463,"was quiet, it carried clearly through the catcalls and jeers. “Will you"
464,babysit the cubs?”
465,"The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father,"
466,"who was staring down into his own lap, then caught his mother’s"

468,own deadpan stare at the opposite wall.
469,"“Enough,” said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake."
470,“Enough.”
471,And the laughter died at once.
472,“Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over
473,"time,” he said as Bellatrix gazed at him, breathless and imploring."

477,"“You must prune yours, must you not, to keep it healthy? Cut away"
478,those parts that threaten the health of the rest.”
479,"“Yes, my Lord,” whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears"
480,of gratitude again. “At the first chance!”
481,"“You shall have it,” said Voldemort. “And in your family, so in"
482,the world . . . we shall cut away the canker that infects us until only
483,those of the true blood remain. . . .”
484,"Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy’s wand, pointed it directly at the"
485,"slowly revolving figure suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny"
486,flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to struggle
487,against invisible bonds.
488,"“Do you recognize our guest, Severus?” asked Voldemort."
489,Snape raised his eyes to the upside-down face. All of the Death
490,"Eaters were looking up at the captive now, as though they had been"
491,given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face the fire-
492,"light, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, “Severus!"
493,Help me!”
494,"“Ah, yes,” said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again."
495,"“And you, Draco?” asked Voldemort, stroking the snake’s snout"
496,with his wand-free hand. Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that
497,"the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her anymore."
498,"“But you would not have taken her classes,” said Voldemort. “For"
499,"those of you who do not know, we are joined here tonight by Charity"
500,"Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witch-"
501,craft and Wizardry.”
502,There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A
503,"broad, hunched woman with pointed teeth cackled."
504,“Yes . . . Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and
505, 11  
506,CHAPTER ONE
507,wizards all about Muggles . . . how they are not so different from
508,us . . .”
509,One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage re-
510,volved to face Snape again.
511,“Severus . . . please . . . please . . .”
512,"“Silence,” said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy’s wand,"
513,and Charity fell silent as if gagged. “Not content with corrupting
514,"and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week Professor"
515,Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily
516,"Prophet. Wizards, she says, must accept these thieves of their knowl-"
517,"edge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, says Professor"
518,"Burbage, a most desirable circumstance. . . . She would have us all"
519,"mate with Muggles . . . or, no doubt, werewolves. . . .”"
520,Nobody laughed this time: There was no mistaking the anger and
521,"contempt in Voldemort’s voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage"
522,revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her eyes into her
523,"hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly"
524,away from him again.
525,“Avada Kedavra.”
526,The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room.
527,"Charity fell, with a resounding crash, onto the table below, which"
528,trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in their
529,chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor.
530,"“Dinner, Nagini,” said Voldemort softly, and the great snake"
531,swayed and slithered from his shoulders onto the polished wood.

533,CHAPTER TWO
534,IN MEMORIAM
535,H          arry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left
536,"and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his"
537,bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china: He had trod-
538,den on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside
539,his bedroom door.
540,“What the — ?”
541,"He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was"
542,deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley’s idea of a clever booby
543,"trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the frag-"
544,ments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the
545,already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he
546,tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap.
547,"It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had"
548,four days left of being unable to perform magic . . . but he had to ad-
549,mit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated
550,"him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came"
551,  13  
552,CHAPTER TWO
553,to think of it — particularly in light of his immediate plans — this
554,seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental
555,"note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet"
556,"paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to"
557,his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.
558,Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school
559,trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the
560,"start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off"
561,the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated
562,"them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom — old quills,"
563,"desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previ-"
564,"ously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a"
565,"stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn"
566,it to see a lot of blood.
567,He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside
568,"the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retriev-"
569,ing an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC
570,"DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneak-"
571,"oscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had"
572,"been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done"
573,the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long frag-
574,"ment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had"
575,given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk
576,"for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather’s last gift"
577,"except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris"
578,like glittering grit.
579,Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had
580,"cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected"
581,back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning’s
582, 14   
583,IN MEMORIAM
584,"Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem"
585,"the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of"
586,"longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by at-"
587,tacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.
588,"It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the use-"
589,"less items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or"
590,not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch
591,"robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were"
592,"piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and"
593,"uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, proba-"
594,"bly, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle"
595,"clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, the"
596,"photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and"
597,his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket
598,were the Marauder’s Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B.
599,inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it
600,was valuable — in all usual senses it was worthless — but because
601,of what it had cost to attain it.
602,This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside
603,"his snowy owl, Hedwig: one for each of the days Harry had spent"
604,at Privet Drive this summer.
605,"He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk."
606,Hedwig made no movement as he began to flick through the news-
607,"papers, throwing them onto the rubbish pile one by one. The owl was"
608,"asleep, or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited"
609,amount of time she was allowed out of her cage at the moment.
610,"As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed"
611,"down, searching for one particular issue that he knew had arrived"
612,shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the summer; he
613, 15   
614,CHAPTER TWO
615,remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about
616,"the resignation of Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at"
617,"Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, he sank into his"
618,desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for.
619,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED
620,by Elphias Doge
621,I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of
622,"eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts."
623,Our mutual attraction was undoubt-
624,edly due to the fact that we both felt
625,ourselves to be outsiders. I had con-
626,"tracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school,"
627,"and while I was no longer contagious, my pock-"
628,marked visage and greenish hue did not encour-
629,"age many to approach me. For his part, Albus had"
630,arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted
631,"notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father,"
632,"Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-"
633,publicized attack upon three young Muggles.
634,Albus never attempted to deny that his father
635,(who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this
636,"crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage"
637,"to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to"
638,"be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak"
639,"of the sad business, though many attempted to make"
640,"him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise"
641,his father’s action and assumed that Albus too was a
642,Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mis-
643, 16 
644,IN MEMORIAM
645,"taken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he"
646,never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency.
647,"Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights"
648,gained him many enemies in subsequent years.
649,"In a matter of months, however, Albus’s own fame"
650,had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of
651,his first year he would never again be known as the
652,"son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less"
653,than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school.
654,Those of us who were privileged to be his friends ben-
655,"efited from his example, not to mention his help and"
656,"encouragement, with which he was always generous."
657,He confessed to me in later life that he knew even
658,then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.
659,He not only won every prize of note that the school
660,"offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with"
661,"the most notable magical names of the day, including"
662,"Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda"
663,"Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waf-"
664,"fling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers"
665,found their way into learned publications such as
666,"Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and"
667,The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore’s future career
668,"seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question"
669,that remained was when he would become Minister
670,of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years
671,"that he was on the point of taking the job, however,"
672,he never had Ministerial ambitions.
673,"Three years after we had started at Hogwarts,"
674, 17  
675,CHAPTER TWO
676,"Albus’s brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They"
677,"were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and,"
678,"unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by duel-"
679,ing rather than through reasoned discussion. How-
680,"ever, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that"
681,the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along
682,as comfortably as two such different boys could do.
683,"In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that"
684,living in Albus’s shadow cannot have been an alto-
685,gether comfortable experience. Being continually
686,outshone was an occupational hazard of being his
687,friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable
688,as a brother.
689,When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to
690,"take the then-traditional tour of the world together,"
691,"visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pur-"
692,"suing our separate careers. However, tragedy inter-"
693,"vened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus’s mother,"
694,"Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole"
695,"breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my depar-"
696,ture long enough to pay my respects at Kendra’s
697,"funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary"
698,journey. With a younger brother and sister to care
699,"for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer"
700,be any question of Albus accompanying me.
701,That was the period of our lives when we had least
702,"contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, perhaps insen-"
703,"sitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow es-"
704,capes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments
705,  18 
706,IN MEMORIAM
707,of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little
708,"of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustrat-"
709,ingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in
710,"my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard,"
711,"toward the end of my year’s travels, that yet another"
712,tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of
713,"his sister, Ariana."
714,Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long
715,"time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their"
716,"mother, had a profound effect on both of her broth-"
717,ers. All those closest to Albus — and I count my-
718,self one of that lucky number — agree that Ariana’s
719,"death, and Albus’s feeling of personal responsibility"
720,"for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left their"
721,mark upon him forevermore.
722,I returned home to find a young man who had
723,experienced a much older person’s suffering. Albus
724,"was more reserved than before, and much less light-"
725,"hearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana"
726,"had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus"
727,"and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time"
728,"this would lift — in later years they reestablished,"
729,"if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial"
730,"one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of"
731,"Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to"
732,mention them.
733,Other quills will describe the triumphs of the fol-
734,lowing years. Dumbledore’s innumerable contribu-
735,"tions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including"
736, 19  
737,CHAPTER TWO
738,"his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood,"
739,"will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom"
740,he displayed in the many judgments he made while
741,"Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still,"
742,that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between
743,Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who
744,witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe
745,they felt as they watched these two extraordinary
746,"wizards do battle. Dumbledore’s triumph, and its"
747,"consequences for the Wizarding world, are consid-"
748,ered a turning point in magical history to match the
749,introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy
750,or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
751,Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he
752,"could find something to value in anyone, however"
753,"apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe"
754,that his early losses endowed him with great human-
755,ity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more
756,"than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to"
757,the Wizarding world’s. That he was the most inspir-
758,ing and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters
759,cannot be in question. He died as he lived: working
760,"always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as"
761,willing to stretch out a hand to a small boy with
762,dragon pox as he was on the day that I met him.
763,Harry finished reading but continued to gaze at the picture ac-
764,"companying the obituary. Dumbledore was wearing his familiar,"
765, 20  
766,IN MEMORIAM
767,"kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon spec-"
768,"tacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry,"
769,whose sadness mingled with a sense of humiliation.
770,"He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since"
771,reading this obituary he had been forced to recognize that he had
772,barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined Dumbledore’s
773,childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as
774,"Harry had known him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea"
775,"of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like trying to imagine a"
776,stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt.
777,He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No
778,"doubt it would have felt strange, impertinent even, but after all, it"
779,had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in
780,"that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought"
781,"to ask Dumbledore what that had been like, nor about any of his"
782,"other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry,"
783,"Harry’s past, Harry’s future, Harry’s plans . . . and it seemed to"
784,"Harry now, despite the fact that his future was so dangerous and"
785,"so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when"
786,"he had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though"
787,the only personal question he had ever asked his headmaster was
788,also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered
789,honestly:
790,“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
791,"“I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”"
792,"After several minutes’ thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the"
793,"Prophet, folded it carefully, and tucked it inside the first volume of"
794,Practical Defensive Magic and Its Use Against the Dark Arts. Then he
795,  21  
796,CHAPTER TWO
797,threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to
798,face the room. It was much tidier. The only things left out of place
799,"were today’s Daily Prophet, still lying on the bed, and on top of it,"
800,the piece of broken mirror.
801,"Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today’s"
802,"Prophet, and unfolded the newspaper. He had merely glanced at the"
803,headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the delivery
804,"owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said"
805,nothing about Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was
806,leaning on the Prophet to suppress news about Voldemort. It was
807,"only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed."
808,Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was
809,set over a picture of Dumbledore striding along looking harried:
810,DUMBLEDORE — THE TRUTH AT LAST?
811,"Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed"
812,genius considered by many to be the greatest wizard
813,of his generation. Stripping away the popular image
814,"of serene, silver-bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals"
815,"the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the life-"
816,"long feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore"
817,carried to his grave. WHY was the man tipped to be
818,Minister of Magic content to remain a mere head-
819,master? WHAT was the real purpose of the secret
820,organization known as the Order of the Phoenix?
821,HOW did Dumbledore really meet his end?
822,The answers to these and many more questions
823,"are explored in the explosive new biography, The"
824,"Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter,"
825, 22  
826,IN MEMORIAM
827,"exclusively interviewed by Betty Braithwaite, page"
828,"13, inside."
829,Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article
830,was topped with a picture showing another familiar face: a woman
831,"wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde hair, her teeth"
832,"bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling"
833,her fingers up at him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating im-
834,"age, Harry read on."
835,"In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and"
836,softer than her famously ferocious quill-portraits
837,might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her
838,"cozy home, she leads me straight into the kitchen"
839,"for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes"
840,"without saying, a steaming vat of freshest gossip."
841,"“Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer’s"
842,"dream,” says Skeeter. “Such a long, full life. I’m sure"
843,"my book will be the first of very, very many.”"
844,Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her
845,nine-hundred-page book was completed a mere four
846,weeks after Dumbledore’s mysterious death in June.
847,I ask her how she managed this superfast feat.
848,"“Oh, when you’ve been a journalist as long as"
849,"I have, working to a deadline is second nature. I"
850,knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for
851,the full story and I wanted to be the first to meet
852,that need.”
853,"I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks"
854, 23  
855,CHAPTER TWO
856,"of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the Wizen-"
857,gamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumble-
858,"dore’s, that “Skeeter’s book contains less fact than a"
859,Chocolate Frog card.”
860,Skeeter throws back her head and laughs.
861,“Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him
862,"a few years back about merpeople rights, bless him."
863,"Completely gaga, seemed to think we were sitting"
864,"at the bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me"
865,to watch out for trout.”
866,And yet Elphias Doge’s accusations of inaccuracy
867,have been echoed in many places. Does Skeeter re-
868,ally feel that four short weeks have been enough to
869,gain a full picture of Dumbledore’s long and ex-
870,traordinary life?
871,"“Oh, my dear,” beams Skeeter, rapping me affec-"
872,"tionately across the knuckles, “you know as well as"
873,I do how much information can be generated by a
874,"fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word ‘no,’"
875,and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes Quill! People were
876,queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway.
877,"Not everyone thought he was so wonderful, you"
878,know — he trod on an awful lot of important toes.
879,"But old Dodgy Doge can get off his high hippogriff,"
880,because I’ve had access to a source most journal-
881,"ists would swap their wands for, one who has never"
882,spoken in public before and who was close to Dum-
883,bledore during the most turbulent and disturbing
884,phase of his youth.”
885, 24 
886,IN MEMORIAM
887,The advance publicity for Skeeter’s biography has
888,certainly suggested that there will be shocks in store
889,for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a
890,blameless life. What were the biggest surprises she
891,"uncovered, I ask?"
892,"“Now, come off it, Betty, I’m not giving away all"
893,the highlights before anybody’s bought the book!”
894,laughs Skeeter. “But I can promise that anybody
895,who still thinks Dumbledore was white as his beard
896,is in for a rude awakening! Let’s just say that nobody
897,hearing him rage against You-Know-Who would
898,have dreamed that he dabbled in the Dark Arts
899,himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent
900,"his later years pleading for tolerance, he wasn’t ex-"
901,"actly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Al-"
902,"bus Dumbledore had an extremely murky past, not"
903,"to mention that very fishy family, which he worked"
904,so hard to keep hushed up.”
905,I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore’s
906,"brother, Aberforth, whose conviction by the Wizen-"

908,fifteen years ago.
909,"“Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,”"

911,worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling
912,"about with goats, worse even than the Muggle-"

918,"that intrigued me, and a little digging uncovered a"
919,"positive nest of nastiness — but, as I say, you’ll have"
920,to wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All
921,"I can say now is, it’s no wonder Dumbledore never"
922,talked about how his nose got broken.”
923,"Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter"
924,deny the brilliance that led to Dumbledore’s many
925,magical discoveries?
926,"“He had brains,” she concedes, “although many"
927,now question whether he could really take full credit
928,for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in
929,"chapter sixteen, Ivor Dillonsby claims he had al-"
930,ready discovered eight uses of dragon’s blood when
931,Dumbledore ‘borrowed’ his papers.”
932,But the importance of some of Dumbledore’s
933,"achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. What of"
934,his famous defeat of Grindelwald?
935,"“Oh, now, I’m glad you mentioned Grindelwald,”"
936,says Skeeter with a tantalizing smile. “I’m afraid those
937,who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore’s spectacular
938,victory must brace themselves for a bombshell — or
939,perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed.
940,"All I’ll say is, don’t be so sure that there really was"
941,the spectacular duel of legend. After they’ve read my
942,"book, people may be forced to conclude that Grin-"
943,delwald simply conjured a white handkerchief from
944,the end of his wand and came quietly!”
945,Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this
946,"intriguing subject, so we turn instead to the rela-"
947, 26  
948,IN MEMORIAM
949,tionship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers
950,more than any other.
951,"“Oh yes,” says Skeeter, nodding briskly, “I devote"
952,an entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore
953,"relationship. It’s been called unhealthy, even sinis-"
954,"ter. Again, your readers will have to buy my book"
955,"for the whole story, but there is no question that"
956,Dumbledore took an unnatural interest in Potter
957,from the word go. Whether that was really in the
958,"boy’s best interests — well, we’ll see. It’s certainly"
959,an open secret that Potter has had a most troubled
960,adolescence.”
961,I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry
962,"Potter, whom she so famously interviewed last year:"
963,a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclu-
964,sively of his conviction that You-Know-Who had
965,returned.
966,"“Oh, yes, we’ve developed a close bond,” says"
967,"Skeeter. “Poor Potter has few real friends, and we"
968,met at one of the most testing moments of his life
969,— the Triwizard Tournament. I am probably one
970,of the only people alive who can say that they know
971,the real Harry Potter.”
972,Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still
973,circulating about Dumbledore’s final hours. Does
974,Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumble-
975,dore died?
976,"“Well, I don’t want to say too much — it’s all in"

983,against whom he has a notorious grudge. Is every-
984,thing as it seems? That is for the Wizarding com-
985,munity to decide — once they’ve read my book.”
986,"On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There"
987,can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an instant
988,"bestseller. Dumbledore’s legions of admirers, mean-"
989,"while, may well be trembling at what is soon to"
990,emerge about their hero.
991,"Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare"
992,blankly at the page. Revulsion and fury rose in him like vomit; he
993,"balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the wall,"
994,where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflow-
995,ing bin.
996,"He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty draw-"
997,"ers and picking up books only to replace them on the same piles,"
998,"barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from"
999,Rita’s article echoed in his head: An entire chapter to the whole Potter-

1001,He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth . . . I’ve had access to
1002,a source most journalists would swap their wands for . . .
1003,"“Lies!” Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the"
1004,"next-door neighbor, who had paused to restart his lawn mower,"
1005,look up nervously.
1006,Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced
1007,"away from him; he picked it up and turned it over in his fingers,"

1011,Skeeter was defaming him. . . .
1012,"A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on"
1013,"the jagged edge of the mirror again. He had imagined it, he must"
1014,"have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a sickly"
1015,peach color of Aunt Petunia’s choosing: There was nothing blue
1016,there for the mirror to reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment
1017,"again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye looking back"
1018,at him.
1019,"He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it,"
1020,because he had been thinking of his dead headmaster. If anything
1021,"was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus Dumbledore"
1022,would never pierce him again.

1027,T      he sound of the front door slamming echoed up the stairs
1028,"and a voice yelled, “Oi! You!”"
1029,Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom
1030,"his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond."
1031,"He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second,"
1032,he had thought he saw Dumbledore’s eye. It was not until his uncle
1033,"bellowed, “BOY!” that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for"
1034,"the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the"
1035,rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him.
1036,“You took your time!” roared Vernon Dursley when Harry ap-
1037,"peared at the top of the stairs. “Get down here, I want a word!”"
1038,"Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets."
1039,When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They
1040,"were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket,"
1041,"Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry’s"
1042,"large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket."
1043,  30 
1044,THE DURSLEYS
1045,DEPARTING
1046,“Yes?” asked Harry.
1047,“Sit down!” said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows.
1048,"“Please!” added Uncle Vernon, wincing slightly as though the word"
1049,was sharp in his throat.
1050,Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle
1051,"began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following"
1052,"his movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple"
1053,"face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front"
1054,of Harry and spoke.
1055,"“I’ve changed my mind,” he said."
1056,"“What a surprise,” said Harry."
1057,“Don’t you take that tone —” began Aunt Petunia in a shrill
1058,"voice, but Vernon Dursley waved her down."
1059,"“It’s all a lot of claptrap,” said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry"
1060,with piggy little eyes. “I’ve decided I don’t believe a word of it. We’re
1061,"staying put, we’re not going anywhere.”"
1062,Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation
1063,and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every
1064,"twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking"
1065,and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry’s favorite
1066,"moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dud-"
1067,ley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had
1068,"been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and"
1069,collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.
1070,"“According to you,” Vernon Dursley said now, resuming his pac-"
1071,"ing up and down the living room, “we — Petunia, Dudley, and I"
1072,— are in danger. From — from —”
1073,"“Some of ‘my lot,’ right,” said Harry."
1074,"“Well, I don’t believe it,” repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt"
1075, 31  
1076,CHAPTER THREE
1077,in front of Harry again. “I was awake half the night thinking it all
1078,"over, and I believe it’s a plot to get the house.”"
1079,“The house?” repeated Harry. “What house?”
1080,"“This house!” shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein in his forehead"
1081,starting to pulse. “Our house! House prices are skyrocketing around
1082,here! You want us out of the way and then you’re going to do a bit
1083,of hocus-pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your
1084,name and —”
1085,“Are you out of your mind?” demanded Harry. “A plot to get this
1086,house? Are you actually as stupid as you look?”
1087,"“Don’t you dare — !” squealed Aunt Petunia, but again, Vernon"
1088,"waved her down: Slights on his personal appearance were, it seemed,"
1089,as nothing to the danger he had spotted.
1090,"“Just in case you’ve forgotten,” said Harry, “I’ve already got a"
1091,"house, my godfather left me one. So why would I want this one?"
1092,All the happy memories?”
1093,There was silence. Harry thought he had rather impressed his
1094,uncle with this argument.
1095,"“You claim,” said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, “that"
1096,this Lord Thing —”
1097,"“— Voldemort,” said Harry impatiently, “and we’ve been through"
1098,"this about a hundred times already. This isn’t a claim, it’s fact, Dum-"
1099,"bledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley —”"
1100,"Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed"
1101,that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unan-
1102,"nounced visit, a few days into Harry’s summer holidays, of two fully"
1103,grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt
1104,and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the
1105, 32   
1106,THE DURSLEYS
1107,DEPARTING
1108,"Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had"
1109,"once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not"
1110,have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.
1111,"“— Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well,” Harry"
1112,"pressed on remorselessly. “Once I’m seventeen, the protective charm"
1113,"that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me."
1114,"The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you"
1115,"to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you"
1116,hostage I’d come and try to rescue you.”
1117,Uncle Vernon’s and Harry’s eyes met. Harry was sure that in that
1118,instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Ver-
1119,"non walked on and Harry resumed, “You’ve got to go into hiding"
1120,"and the Order wants to help. You’re being offered serious protection,"
1121,the best there is.”
1122,"Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down."
1123,Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door
1124,neighbor’s lawn mower stalled again.
1125,“I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?” asked Vernon Durs-
1126,ley abruptly.
1127,"“There is,” said Harry, surprised."
1128,"“Well, then, why can’t they protect us? It seems to me that, as"
1129,"innocent victims, guilty of nothing more than harboring a marked"
1130,"man, we ought to qualify for government protection!”"
1131,Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical
1132,"of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this"
1133,world that he despised and mistrusted.
1134,"“You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said,” Harry replied."
1135,“We think the Ministry has been infiltrated.”
1136, 33  
1137,CHAPTER THREE
1138,"Uncle Vernon strode to the fireplace and back, breathing so heav-"
1139,"ily that his great black mustache rippled, his face still purple with"
1140,concentration.
1141,"“All right,” he said, stopping in front of Harry yet again. “All"
1142,"right, let’s say, for the sake of argument, we accept this protection."
1143,I still don’t see why we can’t have that Kingsley bloke.”
1144,"Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This ques-"
1145,tion had also been addressed half a dozen times.
1146,"“As I’ve told you,” he said through gritted teeth, “Kingsley is"
1147,"protecting the Mug — I mean, your Prime Minister.”"
1148,"“Exactly — he’s the best!” said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the"
1149,blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the
1150,"news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as"
1151,"he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered"
1152,"the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reas-"
1153,"suring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys"
1154,to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with
1155,"any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him"
1156,with his earring in.
1157,"“Well, he’s taken,” said Harry. “But Hestia Jones and Dedalus"
1158,Diggle are more than up to the job —”
1159,"“If we’d even seen CVs . . .” began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost"
1160,"patience. Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now point-"
1161,ing at the TV set himself.
1162,“These accidents aren’t accidents — the crashes and explosions
1163,and derailments and whatever else has happened since we last
1164,watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he’s be-
1165,"hind it — Voldemort. I’ve told you this over and over again, he kills"

1169,"Muggles for fun. Even the fogs — they’re caused by dementors, and"
1170,"if you can’t remember what they are, ask your son!”"
1171,Dudley’s hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his par-
1172,"ents’ and Harry’s eyes upon him, he slowly lowered them again and"
1173,"asked, “There are . . . more of them?”"
1174,"“More?” laughed Harry. “More than the two that attacked us, you"
1175,"mean? Of course there are, there are hundreds, maybe thousands by"
1176,"this time, seeing as they feed off fear and despair —”"
1177,"“All right, all right,” blustered Vernon Dursley. “You’ve made"
1178,your point —”
1179,"“I hope so,” said Harry, “because once I’m seventeen, all of them —"
1180,"Death Eaters, dementors, maybe even Inferi — which means dead"
1181,bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard — will be able to find you and
1182,will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried
1183,"to outrun wizards, I think you’ll agree you need help.”"
1184,There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid
1185,smashing down a wooden front door seemed to reverberate through
1186,the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle Vernon;
1187,"Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, “But"
1188,what about my work? What about Dudley’s school? I don’t suppose
1189,those things matter to a bunch of layabout wizards —”
1190,“Don’t you understand?” shouted Harry. “They will torture and
1191,kill you like they did my parents!”
1192,"“Dad,” said Dudley in a loud voice, “Dad — I’m going with these"
1193,Order people.”
1194,"“Dudley,” said Harry, “for the first time in your life, you’re talk-"
1195,ing sense.”
1196,He knew that the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened
1197, 35  
1198,CHAPTER THREE
1199,"enough to accept the Order’s help, his parents would accompany"
1200,him: There could be no question of being separated from their Did-
1201,dykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece.
1202,"“They’ll be here in about five minutes,” he said, and when none"
1203,"of the Dursleys replied, he left the room. The prospect of part-"
1204,"ing — probably forever — from his aunt, uncle, and cousin was"
1205,"one that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully, but there was"
1206,nevertheless a certain awkwardness in the air. What did you say to
1207,one another at the end of sixteen years’ solid dislike?
1208,"Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack,"
1209,then poked a couple of owl nuts through the bars of Hedwig’s cage.
1210,"They fell with dull thuds to the bottom, where she ignored them."
1211,"“We’re leaving soon, really soon,” Harry told her. “And then you’ll"
1212,be able to fly again.”
1213,"The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his"
1214,room and downstairs. It was too much to expect Hestia and Dedalus
1215,to cope with the Dursleys on their own.
1216,"“Harry Potter!” squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry"
1217,had opened the door; a small man in a mauve top hat was sweeping
1218,"him a deep bow. “An honor, as ever!”"
1219,"“Thanks, Dedalus,” said Harry, bestowing a small and em-"
1220,barrassed smile upon the dark-haired Hestia. “It’s really good of
1221,"you to do this. . . . They’re through here, my aunt and uncle and"
1222,cousin. . . .”
1223,"“Good day to you, Harry Potter’s relatives!” said Dedalus hap-"
1224,"pily, striding into the living room. The Dursleys did not look at all"
1225,happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of
1226,mind. Dudley shrank nearer to his mother at the sight of the witch
1227,and wizard.

1231,"“I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry"
1232,"has told you, is a simple one,” said Dedalus, pulling an immense"
1233,pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. “We shall be
1234,leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your
1235,"house — Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry"
1236,"with an excuse to arrest him — we shall be driving, say, ten miles or"
1237,"so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for"
1238,"you. You know how to drive, I take it?” he asked Uncle Vernon"
1239,politely.
1240,“Know how to — ? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!”
1241,spluttered Uncle Vernon.
1242,"“Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be ut-"
1243,"terly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs,” said Dedalus."
1244,He was clearly under the impression that he was flattering Vernon
1245,"Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every"
1246,word Dedalus spoke.
1247,"“Can’t even drive,” he muttered under his breath, his mustache"
1248,"rippling indignantly, but fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia"
1249,seemed to hear him.
1250,"“You, Harry,” Dedalus continued, “will wait here for your guard."
1251,There has been a little change in the arrangements —”
1252,“What d’you mean?” said Harry at once. “I thought Mad-Eye was
1253,going to come and take me by Side-Along-Apparition?”
1254,"“Can’t do it,” said Hestia tersely. “Mad-Eye will explain.”"
1255,"The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter"
1256,"incomprehension on their faces, jumped as a loud voice screeched,"
1257,“Hurry up!” Harry looked all around the room before realizing that
1258,the voice had issued from Dedalus’s pocket watch.
1259,"“Quite right, we’re operating to a very tight schedule,” said"
1260,  37  
1261,CHAPTER THREE
1262,"Dedalus, nodding at his watch and tucking it back into his waist-"
1263,coat. “We are attempting to time your departure from the house
1264,"with your family’s Disapparition, Harry; thus, the charm breaks at"
1265,the moment you all head for safety.” He turned to the Dursleys.
1266,"“Well, are we all packed and ready to go?”"
1267,"None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring, ap-"
1268,"palled, at the bulge in Dedalus’s waistcoat pocket."
1269,"“Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus,” murmured"
1270,Hestia. She clearly felt that it would be tactless for them to remain
1271,"in the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, pos-"
1272,sibly tearful farewells.
1273,"“There’s no need,” Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any"
1274,"further explanation unnecessary by saying loudly,"
1275,"“Well, this is good-bye, then, boy.”"
1276,"He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry’s hand, but at the"
1277,"last moment seemed unable to face it, and merely closed his fist and"
1278,began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome.
1279,"“Ready, Diddy?” asked Aunt Petunia, fussily checking the clasp"
1280,of her handbag so as to avoid looking at Harry altogether.
1281,"Dudley did not answer, but stood there with his mouth slightly"
1282,"ajar, reminding Harry a little of the giant, Grawp."
1283,"“Come along, then,” said Uncle Vernon."
1284,He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mum-
1285,"bled, “I don’t understand.”"
1286,"“What don’t you understand, popkin?” asked Aunt Petunia, look-"
1287,ing up at her son.

1295,a ballerina.
1296,“What?” said Uncle Vernon loudly.
1297,“Why isn’t he coming too?” asked Dudley.
1298,"“Well, he — he doesn’t want to,” said Uncle Vernon, turning to"
1299,"glare at Harry and adding, “You don’t want to, do you?”"
1300,"“Not in the slightest,” said Harry."
1301,"“There you are,” Uncle Vernon told Dudley. “Now come on,"
1302,we’re off.”
1303,"He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open,"
1304,but Dudley did not move and after a few faltering steps Aunt Pe-
1305,tunia stopped too.
1306,"“What now?” barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the"
1307,doorway.
1308,It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult
1309,to put into words. After several moments of apparently painful in-
1310,"ternal struggle he said, “But where’s he going to go?”"
1311,Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was
1312,clear that Dudley was frightening them. Hestia Jones broke the
1313,silence.
1314,“But . . . surely you know where your nephew is going?” she
1315,"asked, looking bewildered."
1316,"“Certainly we know,” said Vernon Dursley. “He’s off with some"
1317,"of your lot, isn’t he? Right, Dudley, let’s get in the car, you heard"
1318,"the man, we’re in a hurry.”"
1319,"Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but"
1320,Dudley did not follow.
1321, 39 
1322,CHAPTER THREE
1323,“Off with some of our lot?”
1324,Hestia looked outraged. Harry had met this attitude before:
1325,Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his closest living relatives
1326,took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter.
1327,"“It’s fine,” Harry assured her. “It doesn’t matter, honestly.”"
1328,"“Doesn’t matter?” repeated Hestia, her voice rising ominously."
1329,“Don’t these people realize what you’ve been through? What danger
1330,you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of the anti-
1331,Voldemort movement?”
1332,"“Er — no, they don’t,” said Harry. “They think I’m a waste of"
1333,"space, actually, but I’m used to —”"
1334,“I don’t think you’re a waste of space.”
1335,"If Harry had not seen Dudley’s lips move, he might not have"
1336,"believed it. As it was, he stared at Dudley for several seconds before"
1337,accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for
1338,"one thing, Dudley had turned red. Harry was embarrassed and"
1339,astonished himself.
1340,"“Well . . . er . . . thanks, Dudley.”"
1341,"Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy"
1342,"for expression before mumbling, “You saved my life.”"
1343,"“Not really,” said Harry. “It was your soul the dementor would"
1344,have taken. . . .”
1345,He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no con-
1346,"tact during this summer or last, as Harry had come back to Privet"
1347,Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on
1348,"Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden"
1349,that morning might not have been a booby trap at all. Although
1350,"rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley ap-"
1351,peared to have exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After
1352, 40  
1353,THE DURSLEYS
1354,DEPARTING
1355,"opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley subsided into scarlet-"
1356,faced silence.
1357,Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approv-
1358,ing look that changed to outrage as Aunt Petunia ran forward and
1359,embraced Dudley rather than Harry.
1360,"“S-so sweet, Dudders . . .” she sobbed into his massive chest."
1361,“S-such a lovely b-boy . . . s-saying thank you . . .”
1362,“But he hasn’t said thank you at all!” said Hestia indignantly. “He
1363,only said he didn’t think Harry was a waste of space!”
1364,"“Yeah, but coming from Dudley that’s like ‘I love you,’ ” said"
1365,"Harry, torn between annoyance and a desire to laugh as Aunt Pe-"
1366,tunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry
1367,from a burning building.
1368,"“Are we going or not?” roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again"
1369,at the living room door. “I thought we were on a tight schedule!”
1370,"“Yes — yes, we are,” said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watch-"
1371,ing these exchanges with an air of bemusement and now seemed to
1372,pull himself together. “We really must be off. Harry —”
1373,He tripped forward and wrung Harry’s hand with both of his
1374,own.
1375,“— good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizard-
1376,ing world rest upon your shoulders.”
1377,"“Oh,” said Harry, “right. Thanks.”"
1378,"“Farewell, Harry,” said Hestia, also clasping his hand. “Our"
1379,thoughts go with you.”
1380,"“I hope everything’s okay,” said Harry with a glance toward Aunt"
1381,Petunia and Dudley.
1382,"“Oh, I’m sure we shall end up the best of chums,” said Diggle"
1383,"brightly, waving his hat as he left the room. Hestia followed him."
1384, 41   
1385,CHAPTER THREE
1386,Dudley gently released himself from his mother’s clutches and
1387,"walked toward Harry, who had to repress an urge to threaten him"
1388,"with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand."
1389,"“Blimey, Dudley,” said Harry over Aunt Petunia’s renewed sobs,"
1390,“did the dementors blow a different personality into you?”
1391,"“Dunno,” muttered Dudley. “See you, Harry.”"
1392,"“Yeah . . .” said Harry, taking Dudley’s hand and shaking it."
1393,"“Maybe. Take care, Big D.”"
1394,"Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry"
1395,"heard his heavy footfalls on the graveled drive, and then a car door"
1396,slammed.
1397,"Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief,"
1398,looked around at the sound. She did not seem to have expected to
1399,find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet handkerchief
1400,"into her pocket, she said, “Well — good-bye,” and marched toward"
1401,the door without looking at him.
1402,"“Good-bye,” said Harry."
1403,She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the
1404,strangest feeling that she wanted to say something to him: She
1405,"gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge"
1406,"of speech, but then, with a little jerk of her head, she bustled out of"
1407,the room after her husband and son.

1410,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1411,"H          arry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, arriving at the"
1412,window just in time to see the Dursleys’ car swinging
1413,out of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus’s top hat was visible
1414,between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the backseat. The car turned
1415,"right at the end of Privet Drive, its windows burned scarlet for a"
1416,"moment in the now setting sun, and then it was gone."
1417,"Harry picked up Hedwig’s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack,"
1418,"gave his unnaturally tidy bedroom one last sweeping look, and then"
1419,"made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, where he depos-"
1420,"ited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light"
1421,"was fading rapidly now, the hall full of shadows in the evening light."
1422,It felt most strange to stand here in the silence and know that he
1423,"was about to leave the house for the last time. Long ago, when he"
1424,"had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves,"
1425,the hours of solitude had been a rare treat: Pausing only to sneak
1426,"something tasty from the fridge, he had rushed upstairs to play on"
1427,  43   
1428,CHAPTER FOUR
1429,"Dudley’s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the"
1430,"channels to his heart’s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling to"
1431,remember those times; it was like remembering a younger brother
1432,whom he had lost.
1433,“Don’t you want to take a last look at the place?” he asked Hed-
1434,"wig, who was still sulking with her head under her wing. “We’ll"
1435,never be here again. Don’t you want to remember all the good times?
1436,"I mean, look at this doormat. What memories . . . Dudley puked"
1437,on it after I saved him from the dementors. . . . Turns out he was
1438,"grateful after all, can you believe it? . . . And last summer, Dumble-"
1439,dore walked through that front door. . . .”
1440,Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig
1441,"did nothing to help him retrieve it, but continued to sit with her"
1442,head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door.
1443,"“And under here, Hedwig” — Harry pulled open a door under"
1444,the stairs — “is where I used to sleep! You never knew me then —
1445,"Blimey, it’s small, I’d forgotten. . . .”"
1446,"Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas, re-"
1447,membering how he used to wake every morning looking up at the
1448,"underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned"
1449,with a spider or two. Those had been the days before he had known
1450,anything about his true identity; before he had found out how his
1451,parents had died or why such strange things often happened around
1452,him. But Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged
1453,"him, even in those days: confused dreams involving flashes of green"
1454,light and once — Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when
1455,Harry had recounted it — a flying motorbike . . .
1456,"There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby."
1457,Harry straightened up with a jerk and smacked the top of his head
1458, 44   
1459,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1460,on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle
1461,"Vernon’s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen,"
1462,clutching his head and staring out of the window into the back
1463,garden.
1464,"The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then,"
1465,"one by one, figures began to pop into sight as their Disillusionment"
1466,"Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, wearing a helmet"
1467,and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black
1468,sidecar attached. All around him other people were dismounting
1469,"from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, black winged horses."
1470,"Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst."
1471,There was a general cry of greeting as Hermione flung her arms
1472,"around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, “All"
1473,"righ’, Harry? Ready fer the off?”"
1474,"“Definitely,” said Harry, beaming around at them all. “But I"
1475,wasn’t expecting this many of you!”
1476,"“Change of plan,” growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enor-"
1477,"mous, bulging sacks, and whose magical eye was spinning from"
1478,darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. “Let’s get
1479,undercover before we talk you through it.”
1480,"Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and"
1481,"chattering, they settled on chairs, sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia’s"
1482,"gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless appliances:"
1483,"Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long"
1484,"plait; Fred and George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and"
1485,"long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, balding, his spectacles a little"
1486,"awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical"
1487,"eye whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite"
1488,"shade of bright pink; Lupin, grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and"
1489,  45   
1490,CHAPTER FOUR
1491,"beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald, black,"
1492,"broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing"
1493,hunchbacked to avoid hitting his head on the ceiling; and Mun-
1494,"dungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog, with his droopy basset"
1495,hound’s eyes and matted hair. Harry’s heart seemed to expand and
1496,"glow at the sight: He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mund-"
1497,"ungus, whom he had tried to strangle the last time they had met."
1498,"“Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime"
1499,Minister?” he called across the room.
1500,"“He can get along without me for one night,” said Kingsley."
1501,“You’re more important.”
1502,"“Harry, guess what?” said Tonks from her perch on top of the"
1503,"washing machine, and she wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glit-"
1504,tered there.
1505,"“You got married?” Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin."
1506,"“I’m sorry you couldn’t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.”"
1507,"“That’s brilliant, congrat —”"
1508,"“All right, all right, we’ll have time for a cozy catch-up later!”"
1509,"roared Moody over the hubbub, and silence fell in the kitchen."
1510,Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. “As Deda-
1511,"lus probably told you, we had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse"
1512,"has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He’s made it an impris-"
1513,"onable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a"
1514,"Portkey here, or Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your"
1515,"protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in at you. Absolutely"
1516,"pointless, seeing as your mother’s charm does that already. What"
1517,he’s really done is to stop you getting out of here safely.
1518,"“Second problem: You’re underage, which means you’ve still got"
1519,the Trace on you.”
1520, 46   
1521,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1522,“I don’t —”
1523,"“The Trace, the Trace!” said Mad-Eye impatiently. “The charm"
1524,"that detects magical activity around under-seventeens, the way the"
1525,"Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone around"
1526,"you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know"
1527,"about it, and so will the Death Eaters."
1528,"“We can’t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you"
1529,turn seventeen you’ll lose all the protection your mother gave you.
1530,In short: Pius Thicknesse thinks he’s got you cornered good and
1531,proper.”
1532,Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.
1533,“So what are we going to do?”
1534,"“We’re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the"
1535,"only ones the Trace can’t detect, because we don’t need to cast spells"
1536,"to use them: brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid’s motorbike.”"
1537,"Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to"
1538,give Mad-Eye the chance to address them.
1539,"“Now, your mother’s charm will only break under two conditions:"
1540,"when you come of age, or” — Moody gestured around the pristine"
1541,kitchen — “you no longer call this place home. You and your aunt
1542,"and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full under-"
1543,"standing that you’re never going to live together again, correct?”"
1544,Harry nodded.
1545,"“So this time, when you leave, there’ll be no going back, and the"
1546,charm will break the moment you get outside its range. We’re choos-
1547,"ing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for You-Know-"
1548,Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen.
1549,“The one thing we’ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who
1550,doesn’t know we’re moving you tonight. We’ve leaked a fake trail
1551, 47   
1552,CHAPTER FOUR
1553,to the Ministry: They think you’re not leaving until the thirtieth.
1554,"However, this is You-Know-Who we’re dealing with, so we can’t just"
1555,rely on him getting the date wrong; he’s bound to have a couple of
1556,"Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in case. So,"
1557,we’ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw
1558,at them. They all look like they could be the place we’re going to
1559,"hide you, they’ve all got some connection with the Order: my house,"
1560,"Kingsley’s place, Molly’s Auntie Muriel’s — you get the idea.”"
1561,"“Yeah,” said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still"
1562,spot a gaping hole in the plan.
1563,“You’ll be going to Tonks’s parents. Once you’re within the
1564,"boundaries of the protective enchantments we’ve put on their house,"
1565,you’ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any questions?”
1566,"“Er — yes,” said Harry. “Maybe they won’t know which of the"
1567,"twelve secure houses I’m heading for at first, but won’t it be sort of"
1568,obvious once” — he performed a quick headcount — “fourteen of
1569,us fly off toward Tonks’s parents’?”
1570,"“Ah,” said Moody, “I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen"
1571,of us won’t be flying to Tonks’s parents’. There will be seven Harry
1572,"Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them with a com-"
1573,"panion, each pair heading for a different safe house.”"
1574,From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what
1575,looked like mud. There was no need for him to say another word;
1576,Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.
1577,"“No!” he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. “No"
1578,way!”
1579,"“I told them you’d take it like this,” said Hermione with a hint"
1580,of complacency.
1581,“If you think I’m going to let six people risk their lives — !”
1582, 48   
1583,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1584,"“— because it’s the first time for all of us,” said Ron."
1585,"“This is different, pretending to be me —”"
1586,"“Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,” said Fred earnestly."
1587,"“Imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as specky,"
1588,scrawny gits forever.”
1589,Harry did not smile.
1590,"“You can’t do it if I don’t cooperate, you need me to give you"
1591,some hair.”
1592,"“Well, that’s that plan scuppered,” said George. “Obviously"
1593,there’s no chance at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you
1594,cooperate.”
1595,"“Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who’s not allowed to use"
1596,"magic; we’ve got no chance,” said Fred."
1597,"“Funny,” said Harry, “really amusing.”"
1598,"“If it has to come to force, then it will,” growled Moody, his"
1599,magical eye now quivering a little in its socket as he glared at Harry.
1600,"“Everyone here’s overage, Potter, and they’re all prepared to take"
1601,the risk.”
1602,Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved
1603,sideways to glare at him out of the side of Moody’s head.
1604,“Let’s have no more arguments. Time’s wearing on. I want a few
1605,"of your hairs, boy, now.”"
1606,"“But this is mad, there’s no need —”"
1607,“No need!” snarled Moody. “With You-Know-Who out there
1608,"and half the Ministry on his side? Potter, if we’re lucky he’ll have"
1609,swallowed the fake bait and he’ll be planning to ambush you on
1610,"the thirtieth, but he’d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two"
1611,"keeping an eye out, it’s what I’d do. They might not be able to get"
1612,"at you or this house while your mother’s charm holds, but it’s about"
1613, 49  
1614,CHAPTER FOUR
1615,to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only
1616,chance is to use decoys. Even You-Know-Who can’t split himself
1617,into seven.”
1618,Harry caught Hermione’s eye and looked away at once.
1619,"“So, Potter — some of your hair, if you please.”"
1620,"Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort"
1621,of way.
1622,“Now!” barked Moody.
1623,"With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of"
1624,"his head, grabbed a hank of hair, and pulled."
1625,"“Good,” said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper"
1626,"out of the flask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please.”"
1627,Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it
1628,"made contact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke,"
1629,"then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold."
1630,"“Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,” said"
1631,"Hermione, before catching sight of Ron’s raised eyebrows, blushing"
1632,"slightly, and saying, “Oh, you know what I mean — Goyle’s potion"
1633,looked like bogies.”
1634,"“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,” said Moody."
1635,"Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of"
1636,Aunt Petunia’s gleaming sink.
1637,"“We’re one short,” said Lupin."
1638,"“Here,” said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the"
1639,"scruff of the neck and dropped him down beside Fleur, who wrin-"
1640,kled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred
1641,and George instead.
1642,"“I’ve toldjer, I’d sooner be a protector,” said Mundungus."
1643,"“Shut it,” growled Moody. “As I’ve already told you, you spineless"
1644, 50  
1645,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1646,"worm, any Death Eaters we run into will be aiming to capture Pot-"
1647,"ter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who would"
1648,want to finish Potter in person. It’ll be the protectors who have got
1649,"the most to worry about, the Death Eaters’ll want to kill them.”"
1650,"Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was"
1651,already pulling half a dozen eggcup-sized glasses from inside his
1652,"cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice Potion"
1653,into each one.
1654,"“Altogether, then . . .”"
1655,"Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank."
1656,All of them gasped and grimaced as the potion hit their throats:
1657,"At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax."
1658,"Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and"
1659,"George were shrinking; their hair was darkening, Hermione’s and"
1660,Fleur’s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls.
1661,"Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the"
1662,large sacks he had brought with him. When he straightened up
1663,"again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front"
1664,of him.
1665,"Fred and George turned to each other and said together, “Wow"
1666,— we’re identical!”
1667,"“I dunno, though, I think I’m still better-looking,” said Fred,"
1668,examining his reflection in the kettle.
1669,"“Bah,” said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, “Bill,"
1670,don’t look at me — I’m ’ideous.”
1671,"“Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I’ve got smaller here,” said"
1672,"Moody, indicating the first sack, “and vice versa. Don’t forget the"
1673,"glasses, there’s six pairs in the side pocket. And when you’re dressed,"
1674,there’s luggage in the other sack.”
1675,  51 
1676,CHAPTER FOUR
1677,The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre
1678,"thing he had ever seen, and he had seen some extremely odd things."
1679,"He watched as his six doppelgangers rummaged in the sacks, pull-"
1680,"ing out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things"
1681,away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for his
1682,"privacy as they all began stripping off with impunity, clearly much"
1683,more at ease with displaying his body than they would have been
1684,with their own.
1685,"“I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,” said Ron, looking"
1686,down at his bare chest.
1687,"“Harry, your eyesight really is awful,” said Hermione, as she put"
1688,on glasses.
1689,"Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each"
1690,"containing a stuffed snowy owl, from the second sack."
1691,"“Good,” said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and"
1692,luggage-laden Harrys faced him. “The pairs will be as follows:
1693,"Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom —”"
1694,“Why’m I with you?” grunted the Harry nearest the back door.
1695,"“Because you’re the one that needs watching,” growled Moody,"
1696,"and sure enough, his magical eye did not waver from Mundungus"
1697,"as he continued, “Arthur and Fred —”"
1698,"“I’m George,” said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. “Can’t"
1699,you even tell us apart when we’re Harry?”
1700,"“Sorry, George —”"
1701,"“I’m only yanking your wand, I’m Fred really —”"
1702,“Enough messing around!” snarled Moody. “The other one —
1703,George or Fred or whoever you are — you’re with Remus. Miss
1704,Delacour —”

1707,"“I’m taking Fleur on a thestral,” said Bill. “She’s not that fond"
1708,of brooms.”
1709,"Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy, slav-"
1710,ish look that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on
1711,his face again.
1712,"“Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral —”"
1713,Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley’s smile; Harry
1714,knew that Hermione too lacked confidence on a broomstick.
1715,"“Which leaves you and me, Ron!” said Tonks brightly, knocking"
1716,over a mug tree as she waved at him.
1717,Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione.
1718,"“An’ you’re with me, Harry. That all righ’?” said Hagrid, looking"
1719,"a little anxious. “We’ll be on the bike, brooms an’ thestrals can’t"
1720,"take me weight, see. Not a lot o’ room on the seat with me on it,"
1721,"though, so you’ll be in the sidecar.”"
1722,"“That’s great,” said Harry, not altogether truthfully."
1723,"“We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,”"
1724,"said Moody, who seemed to guess how Harry was feeling. “Snape’s"
1725,had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he’s never men-
1726,"tioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we’re betting"
1727,they’ll choose one of the Potters who look at home on a broomstick.
1728,"All right then,” he went on, tying up the sack with the fake Potters’"
1729,"clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, “I make it three"
1730,minutes until we’re supposed to leave. No point locking the back
1731,"door, it won’t keep the Death Eaters out when they come looking."
1732,. . . Come on. . . .”
1733,"Harry hurried into the hall to fetch his rucksack, Firebolt, and"
1734,Hedwig’s cage before joining the others in the dark back garden.
1735, 53  
1736,CHAPTER FOUR
1737,On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had
1738,"already been helped up onto a great black thestral by Kingsley,"
1739,Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside the
1740,"motorbike, goggles on."
1741,“Is this it? Is this Sirius’s bike?”
1742,"“The very same,” said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. “An’ the"
1743,"last time yeh was on it, Harry, I could fit yeh in one hand!”"
1744,Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into
1745,the sidecar. It placed him several feet below everybody else: Ron
1746,smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper
1747,car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet
1748,and rammed Hedwig’s cage between his knees. It was extremely
1749,uncomfortable.
1750,"“Arthur’s done a bit o’ tinkerin’,” said Hagrid, quite oblivious"
1751,"to Harry’s discomfort. He settled himself astride the motorcycle,"
1752,which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. “It’s got a
1753,few tricks up its handlebars now. Tha’ one was my idea.”
1754,He pointed a thick finger at a purple button near the speed-
1755,ometer.
1756,"“Please be careful, Hagrid,” said Mr. Weasley, who was standing"
1757,"beside them, holding his broomstick. “I’m still not sure that was"
1758,advisable and it’s certainly only to be used in emergencies.”
1759,"“All right then,” said Moody. “Everyone ready, please; I want"
1760,us all to leave at exactly the same time or the whole point of the
1761,diversion’s lost.”
1762,Everybody mounted their brooms.
1763,"“Hold tight now, Ron,” said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a"
1764,"furtive, guilty look at Lupin before placing his hands on either side"
1765, 54 
1766,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1767,of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life: It roared like a
1768,"dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate."
1769,"“Good luck, everyone,” shouted Moody. “See you all in about"
1770,an hour at the Burrow. On the count of three. One . . . two . . .
1771,THREE.”
1772,"There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the"
1773,"sidecar give a nasty lurch: He was rising through the air fast, his"
1774,"eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him"
1775,brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral
1776,"flicked past. His legs, jammed into the sidecar by Hedwig’s cage and"
1777,"his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So great"
1778,was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of
1779,"number four, Privet Drive; by the time he looked over the edge of"
1780,the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. Higher and
1781,higher they climbed into the sky —
1782,"And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded."
1783,"At least thirty hooded figures, suspended in midair, formed a"
1784,"vast circle in the midst of which the Order members had risen,"
1785,oblivious —
1786,"Screams, a blaze of green light on every side: Hagrid gave a yell"
1787,and the motorbike rolled over. Harry lost any sense of where they
1788,"were: Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging to"
1789,"the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig’s cage, the Firebolt, and his ruck-"
1790,sack slipped from beneath his knees —
1791,“No — HEDWIG!”
1792,"The broomstick spun to earth, but he just managed to seize"
1793,the strap of his rucksack and the top of the cage as the motorbike
1794,"swung the right way up again. A second’s relief, and then another"
1795, 55 
1796,CHAPTER FOUR
1797,burst of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the
1798,cage.
1799,“No — NO!”
1800,The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death
1801,Eaters scattering as Hagrid blasted through their circle.
1802,“Hedwig — Hedwig —”
1803,But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of
1804,"her cage. He could not take it in, and his terror for the others was"
1805,paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of people
1806,"moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring"
1807,"off into the distance, but he could not tell who they were —"
1808,"“Hagrid, we’ve got to go back, we’ve got to go back!” he yelled"
1809,"over the thunderous roar of the engine, pulling out his wand, ram-"
1810,"ming Hedwig’s cage onto the floor, refusing to believe that she was"
1811,"dead. “Hagrid, TURN AROUND!”"
1812,"“My job’s ter get you there safe, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, and"
1813,he opened the throttle.
1814,"“Stop — STOP!” Harry shouted, but as he looked back again"
1815,two jets of green light flew past his left ear: Four Death Eaters had
1816,"broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for"
1817,"Hagrid’s broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were"
1818,"keeping up with the bike; more curses shot after them, and Harry"
1819,had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around
1820,"he cried, “Stupefy!” and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand,"
1821,cleaving a gap between the four pursuing Death Eaters as they scat-
1822,tered to avoid it.
1823,"“Hold on, Harry, this’ll do for ’em!” roared Hagrid, and Harry"
1824,looked up just in time to see Hagrid slamming a thick finger into
1825,a green button near the fuel gauge.
1826, 56  
1827,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1828,"A wall, a solid brick wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Cran-"
1829,"ing his neck, Harry saw it expand into being in midair. Three of the"
1830,"Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was not so lucky:"
1831,He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind
1832,"it, his broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to"
1833,"save him, but they and the airborne wall were swallowed by darkness"
1834,as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up.
1835,More Killing Curses flew past Harry’s head from the two re-
1836,maining Death Eaters’ wands; they were aiming for Hagrid. Harry
1837,responded with further Stunning Spells: Red and green collided in
1838,"midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly"
1839,"of fireworks, and the Muggles below who would have no idea what"
1840,was happening —
1841,"“Here we go again, Harry, hold on!” yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed"
1842,at a second button. This time a great net burst from the bike’s ex-
1843,"haust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they"
1844,"swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their"
1845,unconscious friend had caught up. He bloomed suddenly out of the
1846,"darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, all"
1847,shooting curses after it.
1848,"“This’ll do it, Harry, hold on tight!” yelled Hagrid, and Harry"
1849,saw him slam his whole hand onto the purple button beside the
1850,speedometer.
1851,"With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the"
1852,"exhaust, white-hot and blue, and the motorbike shot forward like a"
1853,bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death Eat-
1854,"ers swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the"
1855,same time felt the sidecar sway ominously: Its metal connections to
1856,the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration.
1857, 57  
1858,CHAPTER FOUR
1859,"“It’s all righ’, Harry!” bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto his"
1860,"back by the surge of speed; nobody was steering now, and the sidecar"
1861,was starting to twist violently in the bike’s slipstream.
1862,"“I’m on it, Harry, don’ worry!” Hagrid yelled, and from inside"
1863,his jacket pocket he pulled his flowery pink umbrella.
1864,“Hagrid! No! Let me!”
1865,“REPARO!”
1866,There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the
1867,"bike completely: Harry sped forward, propelled by the impetus of"
1868,"the bike’s flight, then the sidecar began to lose height —"
1869,"In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted,"
1870,“Wingardium Leviosa!”
1871,"The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne:"
1872,"He had but a split second’s relief, however, as more curses streaked"
1873,past him: The three Death Eaters were closing in.
1874,"“I’m comin’, Harry!” Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but"
1875,Harry could feel the sidecar beginning to sink again: Crouching as
1876,"low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming figures"
1877,"and yelled, “Impedimenta!”"
1878,The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest: For a moment
1879,the man was absurdly spread-eagled in midair as though he had hit
1880,an invisible barrier: One of his fellows almost collided with him —
1881,"Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining"
1882,Death Eater shot a curse so close to Harry that he had to duck below
1883,"the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat —"
1884,"“I’m comin’, Harry, I’m comin’!”"
1885,A huge hand seized the back of Harry’s robes and hoisted him
1886,out of the plummeting sidecar; Harry pulled his rucksack with him
1887,as he dragged himself onto the motorbike’s seat and found himself
1888, 58 
1889,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1890,"back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the"
1891,"two remaining Death Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth,"
1892,"pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, “Confringo!”"
1893,"He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it ex-"
1894,ploded; the Death Eater nearest it was blasted off his broom and fell
1895,from sight; his companion fell back and vanished.
1896,"“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” moaned Hagrid, “I shouldn’ta tried"
1897,ter repair it meself — yeh’ve got no room —”
1898,"“It’s not a problem, just keep flying!” Harry shouted back, as two"
1899,"more Death Eaters emerged out of the darkness, drawing closer."
1900,"As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again,"
1901,Hagrid swerved and zigzagged: Harry knew that Hagrid did not
1902,"dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so inse-"
1903,curely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their
1904,"pursuers, barely holding them off. He shot another blocking jinx"
1905,at them: The closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his hood
1906,"slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw"
1907,the strangely blank face of Stanley Shunpike — Stan —
1908,“Expelliarmus!” Harry yelled.
1909,"“That’s him, it’s him, it’s the real one!”"
1910,The hooded Death Eater’s shout reached Harry even above the
1911,"thunder of the motorbike’s engine: Next moment, both pursuers"
1912,had fallen back and disappeared from view.
1913,"“Harry, what’s happened?” bellowed Hagrid. “Where’ve they"
1914,gone?”
1915,“I don’t know!”
1916,But Harry was afraid: The hooded Death Eater had shouted “It’s
1917,the real one!”; how had he known? He gazed around at the appar-
1918,ently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they?
1919, 59   
1920,CHAPTER FOUR
1921,He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold
1922,of the back of Hagrid’s jacket.
1923,"“Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let’s get out of here!”"
1924,"“Hold on tight, then, Harry!”"
1925,"There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue"
1926,fire shot from the exhaust: Harry felt himself slipping backward off
1927,"what little of the seat he had, Hagrid flung backward upon him,"
1928,barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars —
1929,"“I think we’ve lost ’em Harry, I think we’ve done it!” yelled"
1930,Hagrid.
1931,But Harry was not convinced: Fear lapped at him as he looked
1932,left and right for pursuers he was sure would come. . . . Why had
1933,they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand. . . . It’s him
1934,. . . it’s the real one. . . . They had said it right after he had tried to
1935,Disarm Stan. . . .
1936,"“We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” shouted"
1937,Hagrid.
1938,"Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the"
1939,ground still seemed remote as stars.
1940,Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire; as a Death Eater
1941,"appeared on either side of the bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry"
1942,"by millimeters, cast from behind —"
1943,And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on
1944,"the wind, without broomstick or thestral to hold him, his snake-"
1945,"like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his"
1946,wand again —
1947,Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a
1948,"vertical dive. Clinging on for dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells"
1949,flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly past
1950, 60 
1951,THE SEVEN POTTERS
1952,"him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang"
1953,and saw sparks from the engine; the motorbike spiraled through the
1954,"air, completely out of control —"
1955,Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which
1956,"way was up, which down: His scar was still burning; he expected to"
1957,die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet from
1958,"him, he saw it raise its arm —"
1959,“NO!”
1960,With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the
1961,"Death Eater; to his horror, Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death"
1962,"Eater falling out of sight, their combined weight too much for the"
1963,broomstick —
1964,"Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard"
1965,"Voldemort scream, “Mine!”"
1966,It was over: He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he
1967,"glimpsed another Death Eater swooping out of the way and heard,"
1968,“Avada —”
1969,"As the pain from Harry’s scar forced his eyes shut, his wand"
1970,acted of its own accord. He felt it drag his hand around like some
1971,"great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed"
1972,"eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death"
1973,"Eater yelled; Voldemort screamed, “No!”: Somehow, Harry found"
1974,his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched it with his
1975,"wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling"
1976,straight toward the ground.
1977,"“Hagrid!” Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life."
1978,“Hagrid — Accio Hagrid !”
1979,"The motorbike sped up, sucked toward the earth. Face level with"
1980,"the handlebars, Harry could see nothing but distant lights growing"
1981,  61 
1982,CHAPTER FOUR
1983,nearer and nearer: He was going to crash and there was nothing he
1984,"could do about it. Behind him came another scream, “Your wand,"
1985,"Selwyn, give me your wand !”"
1986,"He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared"
1987,into the red eyes and was sure they would be the last thing he ever
1988,saw: Voldemort preparing to curse him once more —
1989,And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw
1990,Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground below him. He pulled hard
1991,"at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but"
1992,"with an earsplitting, ground-trembling crash, he smashed into a"
1993,muddy pond.

1997,H         agrid?”
1998,Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris of
1999,metal and leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into inches
2000,of muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not understand
2001,where Voldemort had gone and expected him to swoop out of the
2002,darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet was trickling
2003,down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the pond
2004,and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was
2005,Hagrid.
2006,"“Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me —”"
2007,But the dark mass did not stir.
2008,“Who’s there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?”
2009,"Harry did not recognize the man’s voice. Then a woman shouted,"
2010,"“They’ve crashed, Ted! Crashed in the garden!”"
2011,Harry’s head was swimming.
2012,"“Hagrid,” he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled."
2013, 63  
2014,CHAPTER FIVE
2015,"The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt"
2016,"like cushions, with a burning sensation in his ribs and right arm."
2017,His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead was
2018,still throbbing.
2019,“Hagrid?”
2020,He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an un-
2021,"familiar, lamplit sitting room. His rucksack lay on the floor a short"
2022,"distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man was"
2023,watching Harry anxiously.
2024,"“Hagrid’s fine, son,” said the man, “the wife’s seeing to him now."
2025,"How are you feeling? Anything else broken? I’ve fixed your ribs,"
2026,"your tooth, and your arm. I’m Ted, by the way, Ted Tonks — Dora’s"
2027,father.”
2028,Harry sat up too quickly: Lights popped in front of his eyes and
2029,he felt sick and giddy.
2030,“Voldemort —”
2031,"“Easy, now,” said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry’s shoul-"
2032,der and pushing him back against the cushions. “That was a nasty
2033,"crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong"
2034,"with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and"
2035,his Muggle contraptions?”
2036,"“No,” said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. “Death"
2037,"Eaters, loads of them — we were chased —”"
2038,"“Death Eaters?” said Ted sharply. “What d’you mean, Death"
2039,"Eaters? I thought they didn’t know you were being moved tonight,"
2040,I thought —”
2041,"“They knew,” said Harry."
2042,Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through
2043,it to the sky above.

2046,"“Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don’t we? They"
2047,shouldn’t be able to get within a hundred yards of the place in any
2048,direction.”
2049,Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had
2050,been at the point when the motorbike crossed the barrier of the
2051,Order’s charms. He only hoped they would continue to work: He
2052,"imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke,"
2053,looking for a way to penetrate what Harry visualized as a great
2054,transparent bubble.
2055,He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with
2056,his own eyes before he would believe that he was alive. He had
2057,"barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid squeezed"
2058,"through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but"
2059,miraculously alive.
2060,“Harry!”
2061,"Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra, he covered"
2062,the floor between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug
2063,"that nearly cracked his newly repaired ribs. “Blimey, Harry, how did"
2064,yeh get out o’ that? I thought we were both goners.”
2065,"“Yeah, me too. I can’t believe —”"
2066,Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered
2067,the room behind Hagrid.
2068,"“You!” he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it"
2069,was empty.
2070,"“Your wand’s here, son,” said Ted, tapping it on Harry’s arm."
2071,"“It fell right beside you, I picked it up. And that’s my wife you’re"
2072,shouting at.”
2073,"“Oh, I’m — I’m sorry.”"
2074,"As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks’s resemblance"
2075, 65  
2076,CHAPTER FIVE
2077,to her sister Bellatrix became much less pronounced: Her hair was a
2078,"light, soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. Nevertheless,"
2079,she looked a little haughty after Harry’s exclamation.
2080,“What happened to our daughter?” she asked. “Hagrid said you
2081,were ambushed; where is Nymphadora?”
2082,"“I don’t know,” said Harry. “We don’t know what happened to"
2083,anyone else.”
2084,She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped
2085,"Harry at the sight of their expressions; if any of the others had died,"
2086,"it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the plan, given"
2087,them his hair. . . .
2088,"“The Portkey,” he said, remembering all of a sudden. “We’ve got"
2089,to get back to the Burrow and find out — then we’ll be able to send
2090,"you word, or — or Tonks will, once she’s —”"
2091,"“Dora’ll be okay, ’Dromeda,” said Ted. “She knows her stuff, she’s"
2092,been in plenty of tight spots with the Aurors. The Portkey’s through
2093,"here,” he added to Harry. “It’s supposed to leave in three minutes,"
2094,if you want to take it.”
2095,"“Yeah, we do,” said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto"
2096,his shoulders. “I —”
2097,"He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of"
2098,fear in which he left her and for which he felt so terribly respon-
2099,"sible, but no words occurred to him that did not seem hollow and"
2100,insincere.
2101,"“I’ll tell Tonks — Dora — to send word, when she . . . Thanks"
2102,"for patching us up, thanks for everything. I —”"
2103,He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short
2104,"hallway and into a bedroom. Hagrid came after them, bending low"
2105,to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel.
2106, 66 
2107,FALLEN WARRIOR
2108,"“There you go, son. That’s the Portkey.”"
2109,"Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush lying"
2110,on the dressing table.
2111,"“Thanks,” said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready"
2112,to leave.
2113,"“Wait a moment,” said Hagrid, looking around. “Harry, where’s"
2114,Hedwig?”
2115,"“She . . . she got hit,” said Harry."
2116,The realization crashed over him: He felt ashamed of himself as
2117,"the tears stung his eyes. The owl had been his companion, his one"
2118,great link with the magical world whenever he had been forced to
2119,return to the Dursleys.
2120,Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on
2121,the shoulder.
2122,"“Never mind,” he said gruffly. “Never mind. She had a great old"
2123,life —”
2124,"“Hagrid!” said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed"
2125,"bright blue, and Hagrid only just got his forefinger to it in time."
2126,With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line
2127,"had dragged him forward, Harry was pulled into nothingness, spin-"
2128,"ning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he and Hagrid"
2129,hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Seconds later Harry’s feet slammed
2130,onto hard ground and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of
2131,the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside the no longer glowing
2132,"hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley"
2133,"and Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who"
2134,"had also collapsed on landing, clambered laboriously to his feet."
2135,“Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the
2136,others?” cried Mrs. Weasley.
2137, 67  
2138,CHAPTER FIVE
2139,“What d’you mean? Isn’t anyone else back?” Harry panted.
2140,The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley’s pale face.
2141,"“The Death Eaters were waiting for us,” Harry told her. “We"
2142,were surrounded the moment we took off — they knew it was to-
2143,"night — I don’t know what happened to anyone else, four of them"
2144,"chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort"
2145,caught up with us —”
2146,"He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for"
2147,her to understand why he did not know what had happened to her
2148,"sons, but —"
2149,"“Thank goodness you’re all right,” she said, pulling him into a"
2150,hug he did not feel he deserved.
2151,"“Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly?” asked Hagrid a little"
2152,shakily. “Fer medicinal purposes?”
2153,"She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back"
2154,"toward the crooked house, Harry knew that she wanted to hide her"
2155,face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for
2156,information at once.
2157,"“Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed"
2158,"their Portkey, it came back without them,” she said, pointing at"
2159,"a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. “And that one,” she"
2160,"pointed at an ancient sneaker, “should have been Dad and Fred’s,"
2161,"they were supposed to be second. You and Hagrid were third and,”"
2162,"she checked her watch, “if they made it, George and Lupin ought"
2163,to be back in about a minute.”
2164,"Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she"
2165,handed to Hagrid. He uncorked it and drank it straight down in
2166,one.
2167,"“Mum!” shouted Ginny, pointing to a spot several feet away."
2168, 68 
2169,FALLEN WARRIOR
2170,A blue light had appeared in the darkness: It grew larger and
2171,"brighter, and Lupin and George appeared, spinning and then falling."
2172,Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong: Lupin
2173,"was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was"
2174,covered in blood.
2175,"Harry ran forward and seized George’s legs. Together, he and"
2176,Lupin carried George into the house and through the kitchen to the
2177,"sitting room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the lamplight fell"
2178,"across George’s head, Ginny gasped and Harry’s stomach lurched:"
2179,One of George’s ears was missing. The side of his head and neck
2180,"were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood."
2181,No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son than Lupin
2182,"grabbed Harry by the upper arm and dragged him, none too gently,"
2183,"back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his"
2184,bulk through the back door.
2185,“Oi!” said Hagrid indignantly. “Le’ go of him! Le’ go of Harry!”
2186,Lupin ignored him.
2187,“What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter
2188,"visited my office at Hogwarts?” he said, giving Harry a small shake."
2189,“Answer me!”
2190,"“A — a grindylow in a tank, wasn’t it?”"
2191,Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard.
2192,“Wha’ was tha’ about?” roared Hagrid.
2193,"“I’m sorry, Harry, but I had to check,” said Lupin tersely. “We’ve"
2194,been betrayed. Voldemort knew that you were being moved tonight
2195,and the only people who could have told him were directly involved
2196,in the plan. You might have been an impostor.”
2197,"“So why aren’ you checkin’ me?” panted Hagrid, still struggling"
2198,to fit through the door.
2199, 69  
2200,CHAPTER FIVE
2201,"“You’re half-giant,” said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. “The"
2202,Polyjuice Potion is designed for human use only.”
2203,“None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were mov-
2204,"ing tonight,” said Harry. The idea was dreadful to him, he could"
2205,not believe it of any of them. “Voldemort only caught up with me
2206,"toward the end, he didn’t know which one I was in the beginning."
2207,If he’d been in on the plan he’d have known from the start I was
2208,the one with Hagrid.”
2209,“Voldemort caught up with you?” said Lupin sharply. “What
2210,happened? How did you escape?”
2211,Harry explained briefly how the Death Eaters pursuing them had
2212,"seemed to recognize him as the true Harry, how they had aban-"
2213,"doned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who"
2214,had appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary
2215,of Tonks’s parents.
2216,“They recognized you? But how? What had you done?”
2217,“I . . .” Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like
2218,"a blur of panic and confusion. “I saw Stan Shunpike. . . . You know,"
2219,the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried to
2220,"Disarm him instead of — well, he doesn’t know what he’s doing,"
2221,does he? He must be Imperiused!”
2222,Lupin looked aghast.
2223,"“Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to"
2224,capture and kill you! At least Stun if you aren’t prepared to kill!”
2225,"“We were hundreds of feet up! Stan’s not himself, and if I Stunned"
2226,"him and he’d fallen, he’d have died the same as if I’d used Avada"
2227,"Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago,”"
2228,Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering
2229, 70  
2230,FALLEN WARRIOR
2231,"Hufflepuff Zacharias Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to"
2232,teach Dumbledore’s Army how to Disarm.
2233,"“Yes, Harry,” said Lupin with painful restraint, “and a great num-"
2234,"ber of Death Eaters witnessed that happening! Forgive me, but it"
2235,"was a very unusual move then, under imminent threat of death."
2236,Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed
2237,or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal!”
2238,“So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?” said Harry
2239,angrily.
2240,"“Of course not,” said Lupin, “but the Death Eaters — frankly,"
2241,most people! — would have expected you to attack back! Expelliar-
2242,"mus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to think it is"
2243,"your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!”"
2244,"Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a"
2245,grain of defiance inside him.
2246,"“I won’t blast people out of my way just because they’re there,”"
2247,said Harry. “That’s Voldemort’s job.”
2248,Lupin’s retort was lost: Finally succeeding in squeezing through
2249,"the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it collapsed"
2250,"beneath him. Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry ad-"
2251,dressed Lupin again.
2252,“Will George be okay?”
2253,All Lupin’s frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the
2254,question.
2255,"“I think so, although there’s no chance of replacing his ear, not"
2256,when it’s been cursed off —”
2257,There was a scuffling from outside. Lupin dived for the back door;
2258,Harry leapt over Hagrid’s legs and sprinted into the yard.
2259,  71  
2260,CHAPTER FIVE
2261,"Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward"
2262,"them he realized they were Hermione, now returning to her normal"
2263,"appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat hanger. Hermi-"
2264,"one flung herself into Harry’s arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure"
2265,at the sight of any of them. Over Hermione’s shoulder Harry saw
2266,him raise his wand and point it at Lupin’s chest.
2267,“The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?”
2268,"“ ‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,’ ” said Lupin"
2269,calmly.
2270,"Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, “It’s him,"
2271,I’ve checked!”
2272,"“All right, all right!” said Kingsley, stowing his wand back be-"
2273,"neath his cloak. “But somebody betrayed us! They knew, they knew"
2274,it was tonight!”
2275,"“So it seems,” replied Lupin, “but apparently they did not realize"
2276,that there would be seven Harrys.”
2277,“Small comfort!” snarled Kingsley. “Who else is back?”
2278,"“Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me.”"
2279,Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand.
2280,“What happened to you?” Lupin asked Kingsley.
2281,"“Followed by five, injured two, might’ve killed one,” Kingsley"
2282,"reeled off, “and we saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase"
2283,"halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. Remus, he can —”"
2284,"“Fly,” supplied Harry. “I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and"
2285,me.”
2286,"“So that’s why he left, to follow you!” said Kingsley. “I couldn’t un-"
2287,derstand why he’d vanished. But what made him change targets?”
2288,"“Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike,” said Lupin."
2289,“Stan?” repeated Hermione. “But I thought he was in Azkaban?”
2290, 72 
2291,FALLEN WARRIOR
2292,Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh.
2293,"“Hermione, there’s obviously been a mass breakout which the"
2294,"Ministry has hushed up. Travers’s hood fell off when I cursed him,"
2295,"he’s supposed to be inside too. But what happened to you, Remus?"
2296,Where’s George?”
2297,"“He lost an ear,” said Lupin."
2298,“Lost an — ?” repeated Hermione in a high voice.
2299,"“Snape’s work,” said Lupin."
2300,“Snape?” shouted Harry. “You didn’t say —”
2301,“He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a
2302,"speciality of Snape’s. I wish I could say I’d paid him back in kind,"
2303,but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he was
2304,"injured, he was losing so much blood.”"
2305,Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky.
2306,"There was no sign of movement; the stars stared back, unblinking,"
2307,"indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was Ron? Where"
2308,"were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-"
2309,"Eye, and Mundungus?"
2310,"“Harry, give us a hand!” called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in"
2311,"which he was stuck again. Glad of something to do, Harry pulled"
2312,"him free, then headed through the empty kitchen and back into"
2313,"the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending"
2314,"to George. Mrs. Weasley had staunched his bleeding now, and by"
2315,"the lamplight Harry saw a clean, gaping hole where George’s ear"
2316,had been.
2317,“How is he?”
2318,"Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, “I can’t make it grow back,"
2319,not when it’s been removed by Dark Magic. But it could have been
2320,so much worse. . . . He’s alive.”
2321, 73  
2322,CHAPTER FIVE
2323,"“Yeah,” said Harry. “Thank God.”"
2324,“Did I hear someone else in the yard?” Ginny asked.
2325,"“Hermione and Kingsley,” said Harry."
2326,"“Thank goodness,” Ginny whispered. They looked at each other;"
2327,"Harry wanted to hug her, hold on to her; he did not even care much"
2328,"that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the impulse"
2329,there was a great crash from the kitchen.
2330,"“I’ll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I’ve seen my son, now back"
2331,off if you know what’s good for you!”
2332,Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He
2333,"burst into the living room, his bald patch gleaming with sweat, his"
2334,"spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but uninjured."
2335,“Arthur!” sobbed Mrs. Weasley. “Oh thank goodness!”
2336,“How is he?”
2337,Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first
2338,"time since Harry had known him, Fred seemed to be lost for words."
2339,He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin’s wound as if he could
2340,not believe what he was seeing.
2341,"Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father’s arrival,"
2342,George stirred.
2343,"“How do you feel, Georgie?” whispered Mrs. Weasley."
2344,George’s fingers groped for the side of his head.
2345,"“Saintlike,” he murmured."
2346,"“What’s wrong with him?” croaked Fred, looking terrified. “Is"
2347,his mind affected?”
2348,"“Saintlike,” repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at"
2349,"his brother. “You see . . . I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?”"
2350,Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred’s pale
2351,face.
2352, 74  
2353,FALLEN WARRIOR
2354,"“Pathetic,” he told George. “Pathetic! With the whole wide world"
2355,"of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?”"
2356,"“Ah well,” said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. “You’ll"
2357,"be able to tell us apart now, anyway, Mum.”"
2358,He looked around.
2359,"“Hi, Harry — you are Harry, right?”"
2360,"“Yeah, I am,” said Harry, moving closer to the sofa."
2361,"“Well, at least we got you back okay,” said George. “Why aren’t"
2362,Ron and Bill huddled round my sickbed?”
2363,"“They’re not back yet, George,” said Mrs. Weasley. George’s grin"
2364,faded.
2365,Harry glanced at Ginny and motioned to her to accompany him
2366,back outside. As they walked through the kitchen she said in a
2367,"low voice, “Ron and Tonks should be back by now. They didn’t"
2368,have a long journey; Auntie Muriel’s not that far from here.”
2369,Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever
2370,"since reaching the Burrow, but now it enveloped him, seeming to"
2371,"crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. As"
2372,"they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took"
2373,his hand.
2374,"Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky"
2375,every time he turned. Harry was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing
2376,"the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and Lupin"
2377,"stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them"
2378,looked around when Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.
2379,The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years.
2380,The slightest breath of wind made them all jump and turn toward
2381,the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing
2382,Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves —
2383, 75  
2384,CHAPTER FIVE
2385,And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked
2386,toward the ground —
2387,“It’s them!” screamed Hermione.
2388,Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles
2389,everywhere.
2390,“Remus!” Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin’s
2391,arms. His face was set and white: He seemed unable to speak. Ron
2392,tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione.
2393,"“You’re okay,” he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and"
2394,hugged him tightly.
2395,“I thought — I thought —”
2396,"“ ’M all right,” said Ron, patting her on the back. “ ’M fine.”"
2397,"“Ron was great,” said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on"
2398,"Lupin. “Wonderful. Stunned one of the Death Eaters, straight to"
2399,"the head, and when you’re aiming at a moving target from a flying"
2400,broom —”
2401,"“You did?” said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still"
2402,around his neck.
2403,"“Always the tone of surprise,” he said a little grumpily, breaking"
2404,free. “Are we the last back?”
2405,"“No,” said Ginny, “we’re still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-"
2406,"Eye and Mundungus. I’m going to tell Mum and Dad you’re okay,"
2407,Ron —”
2408,She ran back inside.
2409,“So what kept you? What happened?” Lupin sounded almost
2410,angry at Tonks.
2411,"“Bellatrix,” said Tonks. “She wants me quite as much as she wants"
2412,"Harry, Remus, she tried very hard to kill me. I just wish I’d got her,"
2413,I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus. . . . Then we
2414,  76  
2415,FALLEN WARRIOR
2416,got to Ron’s Auntie Muriel’s and we’d missed our Portkey and she
2417,was fussing over us —”
2418,"A muscle was jumping in Lupin’s jaw. He nodded, but seemed"
2419,unable to say anything else.
2420,"“So what happened to you lot?” Tonks asked, turning to Harry,"
2421,"Hermione, and Kingsley."
2422,"They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time"
2423,"the continued absence of Bill, Fleur, Mad-Eye, and Mundungus"
2424,"seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder"
2425,to ignore.
2426,"“I’m going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have"
2427,"been there an hour ago,” said Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping"
2428,gaze at the sky. “Let me know when they’re back.”
2429,"Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away"
2430,into the darkness toward the gate. Harry thought he heard the
2431,faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow’s
2432,boundaries.
2433,"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny"
2434,behind them. Both parents hugged Ron before turning to Lupin
2435,and Tonks.
2436,"“Thank you,” said Mrs. Weasley, “for our sons.”"
2437,"“Don’t be silly, Molly,” said Tonks at once."
2438,“How’s George?” asked Lupin.
2439,“What’s wrong with him?” piped up Ron.
2440,“He’s lost —”
2441,But the end of Mrs. Weasley’s sentence was drowned in a gen-
2442,eral outcry: A thestral had just soared into sight and landed a few
2443,"feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but"
2444,unhurt.
2445, 77  
2446,CHAPTER FIVE
2447,"“Bill! Thank God, thank God —”"
2448,"Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her"
2449,"was perfunctory. Looking directly at his father, he said, “Mad-Eye’s"
2450,dead.”
2451,"Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something"
2452,"inside him was falling, falling through the earth, leaving him"
2453,forever.
2454,"“We saw it,” said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on"
2455,her cheeks in the light from the kitchen window. “It happened just
2456,after we broke out of the circle: Mad-Eye and Dung were close by
2457,"us, they were heading north too. Voldemort — he can fly — went"
2458,"straight for them. Dung panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye"
2459,"tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort’s curse hit Mad-"
2460,"Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and — there"
2461,"was nothing we could do, nothing, we had half a dozen of them on"
2462,our own tail —”
2463,Bill’s voice broke.
2464,"“Of course you couldn’t have done anything,” said Lupin."
2465,They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite com-
2466,"prehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it could not be. . . . Mad-Eye, so tough,"
2467,"so brave, the consummate survivor . . ."
2468,"At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that"
2469,"there was no point waiting in the yard anymore, and in silence they"
2470,"followed Mr. and Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow, and into the"
2471,"living room, where Fred and George were laughing together."
2472,"“What’s wrong?” said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered."
2473,“What’s happened? Who’s — ?”
2474,"“Mad-Eye,” said Mr. Weasley. “Dead.”"
2475,The twins’ grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed
2476, 78  
2477,FALLEN WARRIOR
2478,to know what to do. Tonks was crying silently into a handkerchief:
2479,"She had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and his"
2480,"protégée at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on"
2481,"the floor in the corner where he had most space, was dabbing at his"
2482,eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief.
2483,Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-
2484,whisky and some glasses.
2485,"“Here,” he said, and with a wave of his wand he sent twelve full"
2486,"glasses soaring through the room to each of them, holding the thir-"
2487,teenth aloft. “Mad-Eye.”
2488,"“Mad-Eye,” they all said, and drank."
2489,"“Mad-Eye,” echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup."
2490,The firewhisky seared Harry’s throat. It seemed to burn feeling
2491,"back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, fir-"
2492,ing him with something that was like courage.
2493,"“So Mundungus disappeared?” said Lupin, who had drained his"
2494,own glass in one.
2495,"The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watch-"
2496,"ing Lupin, both wanting him to go on, it seemed to Harry, and"
2497,slightly afraid of what they might hear.
2498,"“I know what you’re thinking,” said Bill, “and I wondered that too,"
2499,"on the way back here, because they seemed to be expecting us, didn’t"
2500,they? But Mundungus can’t have betrayed us. They didn’t know there
2501,"would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared,"
2502,"and in case you’ve forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that"
2503,little bit of skullduggery. Why wouldn’t he have told them the essential
2504,"point? I think Dung panicked, it’s as simple as that. He didn’t want to"
2505,"come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who"
2506,went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic.”
2507, 79 
2508,CHAPTER FIVE
2509,"“You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to,”"
2510,sniffed Tonks. “Mad-Eye said he’d expect the real Harry to be with
2511,"the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, and"
2512,when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley. . . .”
2513,"“Yes, and zat eez all very good,” snapped Fleur, “but still eet does"
2514,"not explain ’ow zey knew we were moving ’Arry tonight, does eet?"
2515,Somebody must ’ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date to an
2516,outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not
2517,ze ’ole plan.”
2518,"She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beau-"
2519,"tiful face, silently daring any of them to contradict her. Nobody did."
2520,The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid hiccuping
2521,"from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had"
2522,"just risked his own life to save Harry’s — Hagrid, whom he loved,"
2523,"whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into giving Voldemort"
2524,crucial information in exchange for a dragon’s egg. . . .
2525,"“No,” Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised:"
2526,The firewhisky seemed to have amplified his voice. “I mean . . . if
2527,"somebody made a mistake,” Harry went on, “and let something slip,"
2528,"I know they didn’t mean to do it. It’s not their fault,” he repeated,"
2529,again a little louder than he would usually have spoken. “We’ve got
2530,"to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don’t think anyone in this"
2531,room would ever sell me to Voldemort.”
2532,More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him;
2533,"Harry felt a little hot again, and drank some more firewhisky for"
2534,"something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye"
2535,had always been scathing about Dumbledore’s willingness to trust
2536,people.

2539,"“Well said, Harry,” said Fred unexpectedly."
2540,"“Yeah, ’ear, ’ear,” said George, with half a glance at Fred, the cor-"
2541,ner of whose mouth twitched.
2542,Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It
2543,was close to pitying.
2544,“You think I’m a fool?” demanded Harry.
2545,"“No, I think you’re like James,” said Lupin, “who would have"
2546,regarded it as the height of dishonor to mistrust his friends.”
2547,Harry knew what Lupin was getting at: that his father had been
2548,"betrayed by his friend, Peter Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He"
2549,"wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set down"
2550,"his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, “There’s work to do."
2551,I can ask Kingsley whether —”
2552,"“No,” said Bill at once, “I’ll do it, I’ll come.”"
2553,“Where are you going?” said Tonks and Fleur together.
2554,"“Mad-Eye’s body,” said Lupin. “We need to recover it.”"
2555,“Can’t it — ?” began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at
2556,Bill.
2557,“Wait?” said Bill. “Not unless you’d rather the Death Eaters took
2558,it?”
2559,Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said good-bye and left.
2560,"The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry,"
2561,who remained standing. The suddenness and completeness of death
2562,was with them like a presence.
2563,"“I’ve got to go too,” said Harry."
2564,Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him.
2565,"“Don’t be silly, Harry,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What are you talk-"
2566,ing about?”

2568,CHAPTER FIVE
2569,“I can’t stay here.”
2570,"He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, it had not hurt"
2571,like this for more than a year.
2572,“You’re all in danger while I’m here. I don’t want —”
2573,“But don’t be so silly!” said Mrs. Weasley. “The whole point of
2574,"tonight was to get you here safely, and thank goodness it worked."
2575,"And Fleur’s agreed to get married here rather than in France, we’ve"
2576,arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after
2577,you —”
2578,"She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not"
2579,better.
2580,“If Voldemort finds out I’m here —”
2581,“But why should he?” asked Mrs. Weasley.
2582,"“There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry,” said Mr."
2583,Weasley. “He’s got no way of knowing which safe house you’re
2584,in.”
2585,“It’s not me I’m worried for!” said Harry.
2586,"“We know that,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “but it would make"
2587,our efforts tonight seem rather pointless if you left.”
2588,"“Yer not goin’ anywhere,” growled Hagrid. “Blimey, Harry, after"
2589,all we wen’ through ter get you here?”
2590,"“Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?” said George, hoisting him-"
2591,self up on his cushions.
2592,“I know that —”
2593,“Mad-Eye wouldn’t want —”
2594,“I KNOW!” Harry bellowed.
2595,He felt beleaguered and blackmailed: Did they think he did not
2596,"know what they had done for him, didn’t they understand that it"
2597,"was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before they"
2598, 82 
2599,FALLEN WARRIOR
2600,had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward
2601,"silence in which his scar continued to prickle and throb, and which"
2602,was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley.
2603,"“Where’s Hedwig, Harry?” she said coaxingly. “We can put her"
2604,up with Pigwidgeon and give her something to eat.”
2605,His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth.
2606,He drank the last of his firewhisky to avoid answering.
2607,"“Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry,” said Hagrid. “Es-"
2608,"caped him, fought him off when he was right on top of yeh!”"
2609,"“It wasn’t me,” said Harry flatly. “It was my wand. My wand"
2610,acted of its own accord.”
2611,"After a few moments, Hermione said gently, “But that’s impos-"
2612,"sible, Harry. You mean that you did magic without meaning to; you"
2613,reacted instinctively.”
2614,"“No,” said Harry. “The bike was falling, I couldn’t have told you"
2615,"where Voldemort was, but my wand spun in my hand and found"
2616,"him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn’t even a spell I recognized."
2617,I’ve never made gold flames appear before.”
2618,"“Often,” said Mr. Weasley, “when you’re in a pressured situation"
2619,you can produce magic you never dreamed of. Small children often
2620,"find, before they’re trained —”"
2621,"“It wasn’t like that,” said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar"
2622,was burning: He felt angry and frustrated; he hated the idea that
2623,they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort’s.
2624,No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him.
2625,"Now that he came to think of it, he had never heard of a wand per-"
2626,forming magic on its own before.
2627,His scar seared with pain; it was all he could do not to moan aloud.
2628,"Muttering about fresh air, he set down his glass and left the room."
2629, 83  
2630,CHAPTER FIVE
2631,"As he crossed the dark yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up,"
2632,"rustled its enormous batlike wings, then resumed its grazing. Harry"
2633,"stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown plants,"
2634,rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore.
2635,"Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore"
2636,would have known how and why Harry’s wand had acted indepen-
2637,"dently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had known"
2638,"about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that"
2639,"existed between his wand and Voldemort’s. . . . But Dumbledore,"
2640,"like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all were"
2641,gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning
2642,in his throat that had nothing to do with firewhisky . . .
2643,"And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he"
2644,"clutched his forehead and closed his eyes, a voice screamed inside"
2645,his head.
2646,“You told me the problem would be solved by using another’s
2647,wand !”
2648,And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated old man lying
2649,"in rags upon a stone floor, screaming, a horrible, drawn-out scream,"
2650,a scream of unendurable agony. . . .
2651,"“No! No! I beg you, I beg you. . . .”"
2652,"“You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!”"
2653,“I did not. . . . I swear I did not. . . .”
2654,"“You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!”"
2655,“I swear I did not. . . . I believed a different wand would
2656,work. . . .”
2657,"“Explain, then, what happened. Lucius’s wand is destroyed!”"
2658,“I cannot understand. . . . The connection . . . exists only . . . be-
2659,tween your two wands. . . .”
2660, 84  
2661,FALLEN WARRIOR
2662,“Lies!”
2663,“Please . . . I beg you. . . .”
2664,And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort’s
2665,"surge of vicious anger, saw the frail old man on the floor writhe in"
2666,agony —
2667,“Harry?”
2668,It was over as quickly as it had come: Harry stood shaking in
2669,"the darkness, clutching the gate into the garden, his heart racing,"
2670,his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized that
2671,Ron and Hermione were at his side.
2672,"“Harry, come back in the house,” Hermione whispered. “You"
2673,aren’t still thinking of leaving?”
2674,"“Yeah, you’ve got to stay, mate,” said Ron, thumping Harry on"
2675,the back.
2676,"“Are you all right?” Hermione asked, close enough now to look"
2677,into Harry’s face. “You look awful!”
2678,"“Well,” said Harry shakily, “I probably look better than Olli-"
2679,vander. . . .”
2680,"When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron"
2681,"looked appalled, but Hermione downright terrified."
2682,“But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar — it wasn’t sup-
2683,posed to do this anymore! You mustn’t let that connection open up
2684,again — Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!”
2685,"When he did not reply, she gripped his arm."
2686,"“Harry, he’s taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half"
2687,the Wizarding world! Don’t let him inside your head too!”

2690,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
2691,T      he shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days
2692,that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in
2693,"through the back door like the other Order members, who passed"
2694,in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would
2695,assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on
2696,his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.
2697,"“Well, you can’t do anything about the” — Ron mouthed the"
2698,word Horcruxes — “till you’re seventeen. You’ve still got the Trace
2699,"on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can’t we? Or,”"
2700,"he dropped his voice to a whisper, “d’you reckon you already know"
2701,where the You-Know-Whats are?”
2702,"“No,” Harry admitted."
2703,"“I think Hermione’s been doing a bit of research,” said Ron. “She"
2704,said she was saving it for when you got here.”
2705,They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had
2706,  86  
2707,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
2708,just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione
2709,"and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath."
2710,"“The Trace’ll break on the thirty-first,” said Harry. “That means"
2711,I only need to stay here four days. Then I can —”
2712,"“Five days,” Ron corrected him firmly. “We’ve got to stay for the"
2713,wedding. They’ll kill us if we miss it.”
2714,Harry understood “they” to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.
2715,"“It’s one extra day,” said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous."
2716,“Don’t they realize how important — ?”
2717,"“ ’Course they don’t,” said Ron. “They haven’t got a clue. And now"
2718,"you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.”"
2719,Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs.
2720,"Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry."
2721,“Mum’s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What
2722,"we’re off to do. She’ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and"
2723,"Lupin’ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you"
2724,"not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though."
2725,She’s determined.”
2726,"Ron’s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch,"
2727,Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help
2728,identify a lone man’s sock that she thought might have come out
2729,of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off
2730,"the kitchen, she started."
2731,“Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are drop-
2732,"ping out of Hogwarts,” she began in a light, casual tone."
2733,"“Oh,” said Harry. “Well, yeah. We are.”"
2734,"The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out"
2735,what looked like one of Mr. Weasley’s vests.
2736, 87  
2737,CHAPTER SIX
2738,“May I ask why you are abandoning your education?” said Mrs.
2739,Weasley.
2740,"“Well, Dumbledore left me . . . stuff to do,” mumbled Harry."
2741,"“Ron and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.”"
2742,“What sort of ‘stuff ’?”
2743,"“I’m sorry, I can’t —”"
2744,"“Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and"
2745,I’m sure Mr. and Mrs. Granger would agree!” said Mrs. Weasley.
2746,Harry had been afraid of the “concerned parent” attack. He forced
2747,"himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that"
2748,they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny’s. This did
2749,not help.
2750,"“Dumbledore didn’t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I’m"
2751,"sorry. Ron and Hermione don’t have to come, it’s their choice —”"
2752,"“I don’t see that you have to go either!” she snapped, dropping all"
2753,"pretense now. “You’re barely of age, any of you! It’s utter nonsense,"
2754,"if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his"
2755,"command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he"
2756,"was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean"
2757,that he wanted you —”
2758,"“I didn’t misunderstand,” said Harry flatly. “It’s got to be me.”"
2759,He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be iden-
2760,"tifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes."
2761,"“And that’s not mine, I don’t support Puddlemere United.”"
2762,"“Oh, of course not,” said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather"
2763,"unnerving return to her casual tone. “I should have realized. Well,"
2764,"Harry, while we’ve still got you here, you won’t mind helping with"
2765,"the preparations for Bill and Fleur’s wedding, will you? There’s still"
2766,so much to do.”
2767, 88  
2768,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
2769,"“No — I — of course not,” said Harry, disconcerted by this sud-"
2770,den change of subject.
2771,"“Sweet of you,” she replied, and she smiled as she left the"
2772,scullery.
2773,"From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron, and Her-"
2774,mione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly
2775,had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior
2776,would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all
2777,from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey.
2778,"After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching fa-"
2779,"vors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping"
2780,"Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canapés, however, Harry started"
2781,to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out
2782,"seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another;"
2783,he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since
2784,"the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing"
2785,Ollivander.
2786,“I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting
2787,"together and planning, she’ll be able to delay you leaving,” Ginny"
2788,"told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the"
2789,third night of his stay.
2790,“And then what does she think’s going to happen?” Harry mut-
2791,tered. “Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she’s holding
2792,us here making vol-au-vents?”
2793,"He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny’s face whiten."
2794,“So it’s true?” she said. “That’s what you’re trying to do?”
2795,"“I — not — I was joking,” said Harry evasively."
2796,"They stared at each other, and there was something more than"
2797,shock in Ginny’s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that
2798, 89  
2799,CHAPTER SIX
2800,this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those
2801,stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was
2802,sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the
2803,"door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in."
2804,"They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now,"
2805,"because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place"
2806,as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death
2807,"of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom"
2808,Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place’s location had become
2809,a Secret-Keeper in turn.
2810,"“And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the"
2811,power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities
2812,for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can’t
2813,expect it to hold much longer.”
2814,“But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by
2815,now?” asked Harry.
2816,"“Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case"
2817,he turns up there again. We hope they’ll be strong enough both to
2818,keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the
2819,"place, but we can’t be sure. It would have been insane to keep us-"
2820,ing the place as headquarters now that its protection has become
2821,so shaky.”
2822,The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to ma-
2823,neuver knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside
2824,Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made
2825,him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was
2826,trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his
2827,chicken.
2828,“No news about Mad-Eye?” Harry asked Bill.
2829, 90 
2830,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
2831,"“Nothing,” replied Bill."
2832,"They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because"
2833,Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult
2834,"to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the"
2835,confusion of the battle.
2836,“The Daily Prophet hasn’t said a word about him dying or about
2837,"finding the body,” Bill went on. “But that doesn’t mean much. It’s"
2838,keeping a lot quiet these days.”
2839,“And they still haven’t called a hearing about all the underage
2840,magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?” Harry called across the
2841,"table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head."
2842,“Because they know I had no choice or because they don’t want
2843,me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?”
2844,"“The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn’t want to admit that You-"
2845,"Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban’s seen a mass"
2846,breakout.”
2847,"“Yeah, why tell the public the truth?” said Harry, clenching his"
2848,knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand
2849,"stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies."
2850,“Isn’t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?” asked
2851,Ron angrily.
2852,"“Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,” Mr. Weasley replied,"
2853,"“terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next"
2854,to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don’t
2855,believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She
2856,hasn’t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains
2857,shut up in his office all day: I just hope he’s working on a plan.”
2858,There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty
2859,plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.
2860, 91  

2862,"“We must decide ’ow you will be disguised, ’Arry,” said Fleur,"

2865,but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after

2867,"From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid."
2868,"“Yes, good point,” said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table,"
2869,"where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scan-"
2870,ning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long

2872,yet?”
2873,"“Why?” exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring"
2874,at his mother. “Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry
2875,and I are fine with it the way it is!”
2876,"“We are holding your brother’s wedding here in a few days’ time,"
2877,young man —”
2878,“And are they getting married in my bedroom?” asked Ron furi-
2879,ously. “No! So why in the name of Merlin’s saggy left —”
2880,"“Don’t talk to your mother like that,” said Mr. Weasley firmly."
2881,“And do as you’re told.”
2882,"Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and"
2883,attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.
2884,"“I can help, some of it’s my mess,” Harry told Ron, but Mrs."
2885,Weasley cut across him.
2886,"“No, Harry, dear, I’d much rather you helped Arthur muck out"
2887,"the chickens, and Hermione, I’d be ever so grateful if you’d change"
2888,the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they’re
2889,arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.”
2890,"But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens."

2893,"“There’s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,” Mr. Weasley told"
2894,"Harry, blocking his access to the coop, “but, er, Ted Tonks sent me"
2895,"most of what was left of Sirius’s bike and, er, I’m hiding — that’s"
2896,"to say, keeping — it in here. Fantastic stuff: There’s an exhaust gas-"
2897,"kin, as I believe it’s called, the most magnificent battery, and it’ll"
2898,be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I’m going to
2899,"try and put it all back together again when Molly’s not — I mean,"
2900,when I’ve got time.”
2901,"When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to"
2902,"be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron’s attic bedroom."
2903,"“I’m doing it, I’m doing — ! Oh, it’s you,” said Ron in relief, as"
2904,"Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he"
2905,had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had
2906,been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting
2907,"in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet,"
2908,"sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into"
2909,two enormous piles.
2910,"“Hi, Harry,” she said, as he sat down on his camp bed."
2911,“And how did you manage to get away?”
2912,"“Oh, Ron’s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change"
2913,"the sheets yesterday,” said Hermione. She threw Numerology and"
2914,Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts
2915,onto the other.
2916,"“We were just talking about Mad-Eye,” Ron told Harry. “I reckon"
2917,he might have survived.”
2918,"“But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,” said Harry."
2919,"“Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,” said Ron. “How can he be"
2920,sure what he saw?”
2921,"“Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a"

2924,"thousand feet,” said Hermione, now weighing Quidditch Teams of"
2925,Britain and Ireland in her hand.
2926,“He could have used a Shield Charm —”
2927,"“Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,” said Harry."
2928,"“Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,” said Ron grumpily,"
2929,punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.
2930,"“Of course we don’t want him to be dead!” said Hermione, looking"
2931,shocked. “It’s dreadful that he’s dead! But we’re being realistic!”
2932,"For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye’s body, broken as"
2933,"Dumbledore’s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its"
2934,socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to
2935,laugh.
2936,"“The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that’s why"
2937,"no one’s found him,” said Ron wisely."
2938,"“Yeah,” said Harry. “Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and"
2939,buried in Hagrid’s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody
2940,and stuffed him —”
2941,"“Don’t!” squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just"
2942,in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman’s
2943,Syllabary.
2944,"“Oh no,” said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp"
2945,"bed. “Hermione, I wasn’t trying to upset —”"
2946,"But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off"
2947,"the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished"
2948,in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief
2949,that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out
2950,"his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, “Tergeo.”"
2951,The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased
2952, 94 
2953,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
2954,"with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to"
2955,Hermione.
2956,"“Oh . . . thanks, Ron. . . . I’m sorry. . . .” She blew her nose and"
2957,"hiccuped. “It’s just so awf-ful, isn’t it? R-right after Dumbledore . . ."
2958,"I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so"
2959,tough!”
2960,"“Yeah, I know,” said Ron, giving her a squeeze. “But you know"
2961,what he’d say to us if he was here?”
2962,"“ ‘C-constant vigilance,’ ” said Hermione, mopping her eyes."
2963,"“That’s right,” said Ron, nodding. “He’d tell us to learn from"
2964,what happened to him. And what I’ve learned is not to trust that
2965,"cowardly little squit, Mundungus.”"
2966,Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two
2967,"more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from"
2968,around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster Book of Monsters
2969,on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and
2970,snapped viciously at Ron’s ankle.
2971,"“I’m sorry, I’m sorry!” Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the"
2972,book from Ron’s leg and retied it shut.
2973,"“What are you doing with all those books anyway?” Ron asked,"
2974,limping back to his bed.
2975,"“Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,” said Hermione."
2976,“When we’re looking for the Horcruxes.”
2977,"“Oh, of course,” said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. “I"
2978,forgot we’ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.”
2979,"“Ha ha,” said Hermione, looking down at Spellman’s Syllabary. “I"
2980,wonder . . . will we need to translate runes? It’s possible. . . . I think
2981,"we’d better take it, to be safe.”"

2984,She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and
2985,"picked up Hogwarts, A History."
2986,"“Listen,” said Harry."
2987,He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with
2988,similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.
2989,“I know you said after Dumbledore’s funeral that you wanted to
2990,"come with me,” Harry began."
2991,"“Here he goes,” Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes."
2992,"“As we knew he would,” she sighed, turning back to the books."
2993,"“You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we’re"
2994,"not going back there, I don’t think I’d feel right if I didn’t have it"
2995,with —”
2996,“Listen!” said Harry again.
2997,"“No, Harry, you listen,” said Hermione. “We’re coming with you."
2998,"That was decided months ago — years, really.”"
2999,“But —”
3000,"“Shut up,” Ron advised him."
3001,“— are you sure you’ve thought this through?” Harry persisted.
3002,"“Let’s see,” said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto"
3003,the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. “I’ve been packing for
3004,"days, so we’re ready to leave at a moment’s notice, which for your"
3005,"information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to"
3006,mention smuggling Mad-Eye’s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right
3007,under Ron’s mum’s nose.
3008,“I’ve also modified my parents’ memories so that they’re con-
3009,"vinced they’re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that"
3010,"their life’s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now"
3011,done. That’s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them

3013,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
3014,"down and interrogate them about me — or you, because unfortu-"
3015,"nately, I’ve told them quite a bit about you."
3016,"“Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I’ll find Mum"
3017,"and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don’t — well, I think I’ve"
3018,cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell
3019,"and Monica Wilkins don’t know that they’ve got a daughter, you"
3020,see.
3021,Hermione’s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back
3022,"off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at"
3023,Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not
3024,"think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for"
3025,Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.
3026,"“I — Hermione, I’m sorry — I didn’t —”"
3027,“Didn’t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might
3028,"happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what"
3029,you’ve done.”
3030,"“Nah, he’s just eaten,” said Ron."
3031,"“Go on, he needs to know!”"
3032,"“Oh, all right. Harry, come here.”"
3033,For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermi-
3034,one and stumped over to the door.
3035,“C’mon.”
3036,"“Why?” Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the"
3037,tiny landing.
3038,"“Descendo,” muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A"
3039,hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their
3040,"feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the"
3041,"square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains."
3042, 97  
3043,CHAPTER SIX
3044,"“That’s your ghoul, isn’t it?” asked Harry, who had never actually"
3045,met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.
3046,"“Yeah, it is,” said Ron, climbing the ladder. “Come and have a"
3047,look at him.”
3048,Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic
3049,space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught
3050,"sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in"
3051,the gloom with its large mouth wide open.
3052,“But it . . . it looks . . . do ghouls normally wear pajamas?”
3053,"“No,” said Ron. “Nor have they usually got red hair or that num-"
3054,ber of pustules.”
3055,"Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in"
3056,"shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry’s eyes became"
3057,"used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron’s pajamas. He"
3058,"was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather"
3059,than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.
3060,"“He’s me, see?” said Ron."
3061,"“No,” said Harry. “I don’t.”"
3062,"“I’ll explain it back in my room, the smell’s getting to me,” said"
3063,"Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to"
3064,"the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books."
3065,"“Once we’ve left, the ghoul’s going to come and live down here in"
3066,"my room,” said Ron. “I think he’s really looking forward to it — well,"
3067,"it’s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool — but he"
3068,"nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he’s going to be me with"
3069,"spattergroit. Good, eh?”"
3070,Harry merely looked his confusion.
3071,"“It is!” said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped"
3072,"the brilliance of the plan. “Look, when we three don’t turn up at"
3073, 98 
3074,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
3075,"Hogwarts again, everyone’s going to think Hermione and I must be"
3076,"with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for"
3077,our families to see if they’ve got information on where you are.”
3078,“But hopefully it’ll look like I’ve gone away with Mum and Dad;
3079,a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the
3080,"moment,” said Hermione."
3081,"“We can’t hide my whole family, it’ll look too fishy and they can’t"
3082,"all leave their jobs,” said Ron. “So we’re going to put out the story"
3083,"that I’m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can’t go back"
3084,"to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can"
3085,"show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit’s"
3086,"really contagious, so they’re not going to want to go near him. It"
3087,"won’t matter that he can’t say anything, either, because apparently"
3088,you can’t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.”
3089,“And your mum and dad are in on this plan?” asked Harry.
3090,“Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul.
3091,"Mum . . . well, you’ve seen what she’s like. She won’t accept we’re"
3092,going till we’ve gone.”
3093,"There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as"
3094,Hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other.
3095,"Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other,"
3096,unable to say anything. The measures they had taken to protect
3097,"their families made him realize, more than anything else could"
3098,"have done, that they really were going to come with him and that"
3099,they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell
3100,"them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words"
3101,important enough.
3102,Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley
3103,shouting from four floors below.
3104,  99  
3105,CHAPTER SIX
3106,"“Ginny’s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,”"
3107,said Ron. “I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days
3108,before the wedding.”
3109,"“Fleur’s sister’s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal,"
3110,"and she’s too young to come on her own,” said Hermione, as she"
3111,pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.
3112,"“Well, guests aren’t going to help Mum’s stress levels,” said"
3113,Ron.
3114,"“What we really need to decide,” said Hermione, tossing Defensive"
3115,Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking
3116,"up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, “is where we’re"
3117,going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to
3118,"Godric’s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but . . . well . . ."
3119,shouldn’t we make the Horcruxes our priority?”
3120,"“If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I’d agree with you,”"
3121,"said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his"
3122,desire to return to Godric’s Hollow. His parents’ graves were only
3123,"part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling"
3124,that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it
3125,was there that he had survived Voldemort’s Killing Curse; now that
3126,"he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn"
3127,"to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand."
3128,“Don’t you think there’s a possibility that Voldemort’s keeping
3129,a watch on Godric’s Hollow?” Hermione asked. “He might expect
3130,you to go back and visit your parents’ graves once you’re free to go
3131,wherever you like?”
3132,This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a
3133,"counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train"
3134,of thought.
3135,  100  
3136,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
3137,"“This R.A.B. person,” he said. “You know, the one who stole the"
3138,real locket?”
3139,Hermione nodded.
3140,"“He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn’t he?”"
3141,Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake
3142,Horcrux in which R.A.B.’s note was still folded.
3143,“ ‘I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as
3144,"I can,’ ” Harry read out."
3145,"“Well, what if he did finish it off?” said Ron."
3146,"“Or she,” interposed Hermione."
3147,"“Whichever,” said Ron, “it’d be one less for us to do!”"
3148,"“Yes, but we’re still going to have to try and trace the real"
3149,"locket, aren’t we?” said Hermione, “to find out whether or not it’s"
3150,destroyed.”
3151,"“And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?”"
3152,asked Ron.
3153,"“Well,” said Hermione, “I’ve been researching that.”"
3154,“How?” asked Harry. “I didn’t think there were any books on
3155,Horcruxes in the library?”
3156,"“There weren’t,” said Hermione, who had turned pink. “Dumble-"
3157,"dore removed them all, but he — he didn’t destroy them.”"
3158,"Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed."
3159,“How in the name of Merlin’s pants have you managed to get
3160,your hands on those Horcrux books?”
3161,"“It — it wasn’t stealing!” said Hermione, looking from Harry to"
3162,"Ron with a kind of desperation. “They were still library books, even"
3163,"if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really"
3164,"didn’t want anyone to get at them, I’m sure he would have made it"
3165,much harder to —”
3166, 101  
3167,CHAPTER SIX
3168,“Get to the point!” said Ron.
3169,"“Well . . . it was easy,” said Hermione in a small voice. “I just did a"
3170,Summoning Charm. You know — Accio. And — they zoomed out
3171,of Dumbledore’s study window right into the girls’ dormitory.”
3172,"“But when did you do this?” Harry asked, regarding Hermione"
3173,with a mixture of admiration and incredulity.
3174,"“Just after his — Dumbledore’s — funeral,” said Hermione in"
3175,an even smaller voice. “Right after we agreed we’d leave school
3176,and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to
3177,get my things it — it just occurred to me that the more we knew
3178,"about them, the better it would be . . . and I was alone in there . . ."
3179,so I tried . . . and it worked. They flew straight in through the open
3180,window and I — I packed them.”
3181,"She swallowed and then said imploringly, “I can’t believe Dum-"
3182,"bledore would have been angry, it’s not as though we’re going to use"
3183,"the information to make a Horcrux, is it?”"
3184,“Can you hear us complaining?” said Ron. “Where are these
3185,books anyway?”
3186,Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from
3187,"the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked"
3188,a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something re-
3189,cently dead.
3190,“This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make
3191,"a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art — it’s a horrible book, really"
3192,"awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it"
3193,"from the library. . . . If he didn’t do it until he was headmaster, I bet"
3194,Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.”
3195,"“Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then,"
3196,if he’d already read that?” asked Ron.
3197, 102 
3198,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
3199,“He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if
3200,"you split your soul into seven,” said Harry. “Dumbledore was sure"
3201,Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked
3202,"Slughorn about them. I think you’re right, Hermione, that could"
3203,easily have been where he got the information.”
3204,"“And the more I’ve read about them,” said Hermione, “the more"
3205,"horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made"
3206,six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your
3207,"soul by ripping it, and that’s just by making one Horcrux!”"
3208,Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort
3209,moving beyond “usual evil.”
3210,“Isn’t there any way of putting yourself back together?” Ron
3211,asked.
3212,"“Yes,” said Hermione with a hollow smile, “but it would be ex-"
3213,cruciatingly painful.”
3214,“Why? How do you do it?” asked Harry.
3215,"“Remorse,” said Hermione. “You’ve got to really feel what you’ve"
3216,done. There’s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you.
3217,"I can’t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?”"
3218,"“No,” said Ron, before Harry could answer. “So does it say how"
3219,to destroy Horcruxes in that book?”
3220,"“Yes,” said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examin-"
3221,"ing rotting entrails, “because it warns Dark wizards how strong they"
3222,"have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I’ve read,"
3223,what Harry did to Riddle’s diary was one of the few really foolproof
3224,ways of destroying a Horcrux.”
3225,"“What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?” asked Harry."
3226,"“Oh well, lucky we’ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,”"
3227,said Ron. “I was wondering what we were going to do with them.”
3228,  103  
3229,CHAPTER SIX
3230,"“It doesn’t have to be a basilisk fang,” said Hermione patiently."
3231,“It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can’t re-
3232,"pair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it’s incredibly"
3233,rare —
3234,"“— phoenix tears,” said Harry, nodding."
3235,"“Exactly,” said Hermione. “Our problem is that there are very few"
3236,"substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they’re all danger-"
3237,ous to carry around with you. That’s a problem we’re going to have
3238,"to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux"
3239,won’t do the trick. You’ve got to put it beyond magical repair.”
3240,"“But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,” said Ron, “why can’t"
3241,the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?”
3242,“Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.”
3243,"Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermi-"
3244,"one hurried on, “Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and"
3245,"ran you through with it, I wouldn’t damage your soul at all.”"
3246,"“Which would be a real comfort to me, I’m sure,” said Ron."
3247,Harry laughed.
3248,"“It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens"
3249,"to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,” said Hermione."
3250,“But it’s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul
3251,"inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival."
3252,It can’t exist without it.”
3253,"“That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,” said Harry, remem-"
3254,"bering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the"
3255,screams of the piece of Voldemort’s soul as it vanished.
3256,"“And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul"
3257,trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the
3258, 104    
3259,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
3260,"diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back"
3261,good as new.”
3262,"“Hang on,” said Ron, frowning. “The bit of soul in that diary was"
3263,"possessing Ginny, wasn’t it? How does that work, then?”"
3264,"“While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside"
3265,it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I
3266,"don’t mean holding it for too long, it’s nothing to do with touching"
3267,"it,” she added before Ron could speak. “I mean close emotionally."
3268,"Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incred-"
3269,ibly vulnerable. You’re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent
3270,on the Horcrux.”
3271,“I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?” said Harry.
3272,“Why didn’t I ask him? I never really . . .”
3273,His voice tailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should
3274,"have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had"
3275,"died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities"
3276,"when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more . . . to find out"
3277,everything. . . .
3278,The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a
3279,wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the
3280,"Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indig-"
3281,"nantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate"
3282,"Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry"
3283,instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking
3284,"up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was"
3285,contorted with rage.
3286,"“I’m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,” she said, her"
3287,voice trembling. “I’m sure you all need your rest . . . but there are
3288, 105    
3289,CHAPTER SIX
3290,wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I
3291,was under the impression that you had agreed to help.”
3292,"“Oh yes,” said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her"
3293,"feet, sending books flying in every direction, “we will . . . we’re"
3294,sorry . . .”
3295,"With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried"
3296,out of the room after Mrs. Weasley.
3297,"“It’s like being a house-elf,” complained Ron in an undertone,"
3298,still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. “Except without
3299,"the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding’s over, the happier I’ll"
3300,be.”
3301,"“Yeah,” said Harry, “then we’ll have nothing to do except find"
3302,"Horcruxes. . . . It’ll be like a holiday, won’t it?”"
3303,"Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of"
3304,"wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley’s room, stopped"
3305,quite abruptly.
3306,The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o’clock.
3307,"Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny were feeling quite resentful to-"
3308,"ward Fleur’s family by this time, and it was with ill grace that Ron"
3309,"stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry at-"
3310,tempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart
3311,"enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the"
3312,visitors.
3313,Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty caul-
3314,drons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the
3315,"back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing"
3316,"either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the"
3317,"leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens"
3318,"had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden"
3319, 106   
3320,THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS
3321,"had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry,"
3322,"who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather for-"
3323,lorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.
3324,He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been
3325,placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all
3326,he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel
3327,by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone
3328,"to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to"
3329,arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusu-
3330,"ally high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr."
3331,"Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage"
3332,"and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf-green robes,"
3333,who could only be Fleur’s mother.
3334,"“Maman!” cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. “Papa!”"
3335,Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he
3336,"was a head shorter and extremely plump, with a little, pointed black"
3337,"beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing toward Mrs."
3338,"Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek,"
3339,leaving her flustered.
3340,"“You ’ave been to much trouble,” he said in a deep voice. “Fleur"
3341,tells us you ’ave been working very ’ard.”
3342,"“Oh, it’s been nothing, nothing!” trilled Mrs. Weasley. “No trou-"
3343,ble at all!”
3344,Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was
3345,peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.
3346,"“Dear lady!” said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley’s"
3347,hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. “We are most
3348,honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let me pres-
3349,"ent my wife, Apolline.”"
3350,  107   
3351,CHAPTER SIX
3352,Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Wea-
3353,sley too.
3354,"“Enchantée,” she said. “Your ’usband ’as been telling us such amus-"
3355,ing stories!”
3356,Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a
3357,"look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an"
3358,expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.
3359,"“And, of course, you ’ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!” said"
3360,Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years
3361,"old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs."
3362,"Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glow-"
3363,"ing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly."
3364,"“Well, come in, do!” said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered"
3365,"the Delacours into the house, with many “No, please!”s and “After"
3366,you!”s and “Not at all!”s.
3367,"The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests."
3368,They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the prepa-
3369,rations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced every-
3370,thing from the seating plan to the bridesmaids’ shoes “Charmant!”
3371,Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and
3372,had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder
3373,"sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering"
3374,away in rapid French.
3375,"On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so"
3376,many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sit-
3377,"ting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour’s"
3378,protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping
3379,"with Fleur in Percy’s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Char-"

3383,"to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in"
3384,"desperation that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took to volunteering"
3385,to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.
3386,"“But she still won’t leave us alone!” snarled Ron, as their second"
3387,attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of
3388,Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.
3389,"“Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens,” she called as she approached"
3390,them. “We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive
3391,"tomorrow . . . to put up the tent for the wedding,” she explained,"
3392,pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. “Mil-
3393,"lamant’s Magic Marquees . . . they’re very good, Bill’s escorting"
3394,"them. . . . You’d better stay inside while they’re here, Harry. I must"
3395,"say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these secu-"
3396,rity spells around the place.”
3397,"“I’m sorry,” said Harry humbly."
3398,"“Oh, don’t be silly, dear!” said Mrs. Weasley at once. “I didn’t"
3399,"mean — well, your safety’s much more important! Actually, I’ve"
3400,"been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday,"
3401,"Harry. Seventeen, after all, it’s an important day. . . .”"
3402,"“I don’t want a fuss,” said Harry quickly, envisaging the addi-"
3403,"tional strain this would put on them all. “Really, Mrs. Weasley,"
3404,just a normal dinner would be fine. . . . It’s the day before the wed-
3405,ding. . . .”
3406,"“Oh, well, if you’re sure, dear. I’ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall"
3407,I? And how about Hagrid?”
3408,"“That’d be great,” said Harry. “But please don’t go to loads of"
3409,trouble.”
3410, 109    
3411,CHAPTER SIX
3412,"“Not at all, not at all . . . It’s no trouble. . . .”"
3413,"She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little"
3414,"sadly, straightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she"
3415,"waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose"
3416,"into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave"
3417,of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her.

3422,H          e was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue
3423,"light of dawn. Far below, swathed in mist, was the"
3424,"shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the"
3425,"man he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who"
3426,"held the answer, the answer to his problem . . . ?"
3427,"“Oi, wake up.”"
3428,Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in
3429,Ron’s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was
3430,still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny
3431,wing. The scar on Harry’s forehead was prickling.
3432,“You were muttering in your sleep.”
3433,“Was I?”
3434,“Yeah. ‘Gregorovitch.’ You kept saying ‘Gregorovitch.’ ”
3435,Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron’s face appeared slightly
3436,blurred.
3437,“Who’s Gregorovitch?”
3438,  111  
3439,CHAPTER SEVEN
3440,"“I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.”"
3441,"Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had"
3442,"heard the name before, but he could not think where."
3443,“I think Voldemort’s looking for him.”
3444,"“Poor bloke,” said Ron fervently."
3445,"Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to"
3446,"remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came"
3447,back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village
3448,cradled in a deep valley.
3449,“I think he’s abroad.”
3450,"“Who, Gregorovitch?”"
3451,"“Voldemort. I think he’s somewhere abroad, looking for Grego-"
3452,rovitch. It didn’t look like anywhere in Britain.”
3453,“You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?”
3454,Ron sounded worried.
3455,"“Do me a favor and don’t tell Hermione,” said Harry. “Although"
3456,how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep . . .”
3457,"He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon’s cage, thinking . . . Why was"
3458,the name “Gregorovitch” familiar?
3459,"“I think,” he said slowly, “he’s got something to do with Quid-"
3460,"ditch. There’s some connection, but I can’t — I can’t think what it"
3461,is.”
3462,“Quidditch?” said Ron. “Sure you’re not thinking of Gorgo-
3463,vitch?”
3464,“Who?”
3465,"“Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Can-"
3466,nons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle
3467,drops in a season.”
3468,"“No,” said Harry. “I’m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.”"
3469, 112    
3470,THE WILL OF

3472,"“I try not to either,” said Ron. “Well, happy birthday anyway.”"
3473,"“Wow — that’s right, I forgot! I’m seventeen!”"
3474,"Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the"
3475,"cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said, “Accio Glasses!”"
3476,"Although they were only around a foot away, there was something"
3477,"immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least"
3478,until they poked him in the eye.
3479,"“Slick,” snorted Ron."
3480,"Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron’s posses-"
3481,"sions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and"
3482,flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces
3483,of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to
3484,"untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange"
3485,robes on Ron’s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.
3486,"“I’d do your fly by hand, though,” Ron advised Harry, sniggering"
3487,when Harry immediately checked it. “Here’s your present. Unwrap
3488,"it up here, it’s not for my mother’s eyes.”"
3489,“A book?” said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. “Bit of a
3490,"departure from tradition, isn’t it?”"
3491,"“This isn’t your average book,” said Ron. “It’s pure gold: Twelve"
3492,Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to
3493,know about girls. If only I’d had this last year I’d have known exactly
3494,how to get rid of Lavender and I would’ve known how to get going
3495,"with . . . Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I’ve learned a"
3496,"lot. You’d be surprised, it’s not all about wandwork, either.”"
3497,When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents
3498,waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing
3499,"their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over"
3500,the frying pan.
3501, 113   
3502,CHAPTER SEVEN
3503,"“Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,” said"
3504,"Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. “He had to leave early for work, but"
3505,he’ll be back for dinner. That’s our present on top.”
3506,"Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and"
3507,unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs.
3508,"Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars"
3509,circling around the face instead of hands.
3510,"“It’s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,”"
3511,"said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker."
3512,"“I’m afraid that one isn’t new like Ron’s, it was actually my brother"
3513,"Fabian’s and he wasn’t terribly careful with his possessions, it’s a bit"
3514,"dented on the back, but —”"
3515,The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her.
3516,He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she
3517,"understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he"
3518,"released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing"
3519,half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.
3520,"“Happy birthday, Harry!” said Hermione, hurrying into the"
3521,kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. “It’s not
3522,"much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?” she added to"
3523,"Ron, who seemed not to hear her."
3524,"“Come on, then, open Hermione’s!” said Ron."
3525,She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages con-
3526,"tained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (“Ah yes, zis will give"
3527,"you ze smoothest shave you will ever ’ave,” Monsieur Delacour as-"
3528,"sured him, “but you must tell it clearly what you want . . . ozzerwise"
3529,"you might find you ’ave a leetle less hair zan you would like. . . .”),"

3535,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the ar-"
3536,"rival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen"
3537,uncomfortably crowded.
3538,"“I’ll pack these for you,” Hermione said brightly, taking Harry’s"
3539,presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs.
3540,"“I’m nearly done, I’m just waiting for the rest of your underpants"
3541,"to come out of the wash, Ron —”"
3542,Ron’s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the
3543,first-floor landing.
3544,"“Harry, will you come in here a moment?”"
3545,"It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took"
3546,"him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous,"
3547,Harry followed Ginny into her room.
3548,"He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There"
3549,was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one
3550,"wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quid-"
3551,"ditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing"
3552,"the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and"
3553,Ginny had once played two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Her-
3554,"mione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The"
3555,golden flag on top was level with Ginny’s window.
3556,"Ginny looked up into Harry’s face, took a deep breath, and said,"
3557,“Happy seventeenth.”
3558,“Yeah . . . thanks.”
3559,"She was looking at him steadily; he, however, found it difficult to"
3560,look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.
3561,"“Nice view,” he said feebly, pointing toward the window."
3562,She ignored this. He could not blame her.
3563,"“I couldn’t think what to get you,” she said."
3564, 115   
3565,CHAPTER SEVEN
3566,“You didn’t have to get me anything.”
3567,She disregarded this too.
3568,"“I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because"
3569,you wouldn’t be able to take it with you.”
3570,He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of
3571,"the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He"
3572,had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have tough-
3573,ened her up.
3574,She took a step closer to him.
3575,"“So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember"
3576,"me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing"
3577,whatever you’re doing.”
3578,“I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the
3579,"ground, to be honest.”"
3580,"“There’s the silver lining I’ve been looking for,” she whispered,"
3581,"and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before,"
3582,"and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion, better"
3583,"than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny,"
3584,"the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-"
3585,smelling hair —
3586,The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart.
3587,"“Oh,” said Ron pointedly. “Sorry.”"
3588,"“Ron!” Hermione was just behind him, slightly out of breath."
3589,"There was a strained silence, then Ginny said in a flat little voice,"
3590,"“Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.”"
3591,Ron’s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted
3592,"to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft"
3593,"had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining mo-"

3599,"have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness"
3600,was gone.
3601,"He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly"
3602,"knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that"
3603,"she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do"
3604,anything to comfort her in front of Ron.
3605,"“I’ll see you later,” he said, and followed the other two out of the"
3606,bedroom.
3607,"Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and"
3608,"into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione"
3609,trotting along behind them looking scared.
3610,"Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron"
3611,rounded on Harry.
3612,"“You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her"
3613,around?”
3614,"“I’m not messing her around,” said Harry, as Hermione caught"
3615,up with them.
3616,“Ron —”
3617,But Ron held up a hand to silence her.
3618,“She was really cut up when you ended it —”
3619,"“So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn’t because I"
3620,wanted to.”
3621,"“Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she’s just going to get"
3622,her hopes up again —”
3623,"“She’s not an idiot, she knows it can’t happen, she’s not expecting"
3624,"us to — to end up married, or —”"

3635,"Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward"
3636,"and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, “Right then, well,"
3637,that’s . . . yeah.”
3638,Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for
3639,"the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that"
3640,they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nev-
3641,"ertheless, Charlie’s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a"
3642,"distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise"
3643,"her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a"
3644,proper haircut.
3645,As Harry’s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow’s
3646,"kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin,"
3647,"Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the"
3648,"garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns,"
3649,"all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the"
3650,"guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley’s ministrations, George’s wound was"
3651,"neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the"
3652,"side of his head, despite the twins’ many jokes about it."
3653,Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end
3654,of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and
3655,bushes.
3656,"“Nice,” said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione"
3657, 118    
3658,THE WILL OF
3659,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
3660,turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. “You’ve really got an
3661,eye for that sort of thing.”
3662,"“Thank you, Ron!” said Hermione, looking both pleased and a"
3663,"little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a"
3664,funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when
3665,he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm
3666,Witches; he caught Ginny’s eye and grinned at her before remem-
3667,bering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation
3668,with Monsieur Delacour.
3669,"“Out of the way, out of the way!” sang Mrs. Weasley, coming"
3670,"through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized"
3671,Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it
3672,"was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her"
3673,"wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When"
3674,"the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said,"
3675,"“That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.”"
3676,"“Oh, it’s nothing, dear,” she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron"
3677,"gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one."
3678,"By seven o’clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by"
3679,"Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane."
3680,"Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible,"
3681,"hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry’s hand,"
3682,"Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks,"
3683,"beside him, looked simply radiant."
3684,"“Happy birthday, Harry,” she said, hugging him tightly."
3685,"“Seventeen, eh!” said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass"
3686,"of wine from Fred. “Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d’yeh"
3687,remember it?”
3688, 119   
3689,CHAPTER SEVEN
3690,"“Vaguely,” said Harry, grinning up at him. “Didn’t you smash"
3691,"down the front door, give Dudley a pig’s tail, and tell me I was a"
3692,wizard?”
3693,"“I forge’ the details,” Hagrid chortled. “All righ’, Ron,"
3694,Hermione?”
3695,"“We’re fine,” said Hermione. “How are you?”"
3696,"“Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns, I’ll show"
3697,yeh when yeh get back —” Harry avoided Ron’s and Hermione’s
3698,"gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. “Here, Harry — couldn’"
3699,"think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this.” He pulled out"
3700,"a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently"
3701,intended to be worn around the neck. “Mokeskin. Hide anythin’ in
3702,"there an’ no one but the owner can get it out. They’re rare, them.”"
3703,"“Hagrid, thanks!”"
3704,"“ ’S’nothin’,” said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand."
3705,“An’ there’s Charlie! Always liked him — hey! Charlie!”
3706,"Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his"
3707,"new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with"
3708,a number of burns and scratches up his muscley arms.
3709,"“Hi, Hagrid, how’s it going?”"
3710,“Bin meanin’ ter write fer ages. How’s Norbert doin’?”
3711,“Norbert?” Charlie laughed. “The Norwegian Ridgeback? We
3712,call her Norberta now.”
3713,“Wha — Norbert’s a girl?”
3714,"“Oh yeah,” said Charlie."
3715,“How can you tell?” asked Hermione.
3716,"“They’re a lot more vicious,” said Charlie. He looked over his"
3717,shoulder and dropped his voice. “Wish Dad would hurry up and
3718,get here. Mum’s getting edgy.”
3719, 120 

3722,They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to
3723,Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.
3724,"“I think we’d better start without Arthur,” she called to the gar-"
3725,den at large after a moment or two. “He must have been held up
3726,at — oh!”
3727,They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came fly-
3728,"ing across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a"
3729,"bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with"
3730,Mr. Weasley’s voice.
3731,“Minister of Magic coming with me.”
3732,"The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur’s family peer-"
3733,ing in astonishment at the place where it had vanished.
3734,"“We shouldn’t be here,” said Lupin at once. “Harry — I’m sorry"
3735,— I’ll explain another time —”
3736,He seized Tonks’s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the
3737,"fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked"
3738,bewildered.
3739,“The Minister — but why — ? I don’t understand —”
3740,"But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr."
3741,"Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by"
3742,"Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled"
3743,hair.
3744,The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden
3745,"and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching"
3746,them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern
3747,"light, Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they"
3748,"had met, scraggy and grim."
3749,"“Sorry to intrude,” said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before"
3750,the table. “Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.”
3751,  121  
3752,CHAPTER SEVEN
3753,His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake.
3754,“Many happy returns.”
3755,"“Thanks,” said Harry."
3756,"“I require a private word with you,” Scrimgeour went on. “Also"
3757,with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.”
3758,"“Us?” said Ron, sounding surprised. “Why us?”"
3759,"“I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,” said"
3760,Scrimgeour. “Is there such a place?” he demanded of Mr. Weasley.
3761,"“Yes, of course,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. “The, er,"
3762,"sitting room, why don’t you use that?”"
3763,"“You can lead the way,” Scrimgeour said to Ron. “There will be"
3764,"no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.”"
3765,Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs.
3766,"Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the"
3767,"way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two"
3768,"were thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow,"
3769,have learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of
3770,Hogwarts.
3771,Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messy
3772,kitchen and into the Burrow’s sitting room. Although the garden
3773,"had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in"
3774,here: Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they
3775,illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in
3776,"the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving"
3777,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa."
3778,"Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke."
3779,"“I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be"
3780,best if we do it individually. If you two” — he pointed at Harry and
3781,"Hermione — “can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.”"
3782,  122  
3783,THE WILL OF
3784,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
3785,"“We’re not going anywhere,” said Harry, while Hermione nodded"
3786,"vigorously. “You can speak to us together, or not at all.”"
3787,"Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the"
3788,impression that the Minister was wondering whether it was worth-
3789,while opening hostilities this early.
3790,"“Very well then, together,” he said, shrugging. He cleared his"
3791,"throat. “I am here, as I’m sure you know, because of Albus Dum-"
3792,bledore’s will.”
3793,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another."
3794,"“A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumble-"
3795,dore had left you anything?”
3796,“A-all of us?” said Ron. “Me and Hermione too?”
3797,"“Yes, all of —”"
3798,But Harry interrupted.
3799,“Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long
3800,to give us what he left us?”
3801,"“Isn’t it obvious?” said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could an-"
3802,swer. “They wanted to examine whatever he’s left us. You had no
3803,"right to do that!” she said, and her voice trembled slightly."
3804,"“I had every right,” said Scrimgeour dismissively. “The Decree for"
3805,Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate
3806,the contents of a will —”
3807,"“That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,”"
3808,"said Hermione, “and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful"
3809,evidence that the deceased’s possessions are illegal before seizing
3810,them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying
3811,to pass us something cursed?”
3812,"“Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss"
3813,Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.
3814, 123  
3815,CHAPTER SEVEN
3816,"“No, I’m not,” retorted Hermione. “I’m hoping to do some good"
3817,in the world!”
3818,Ron laughed. Scrimgeour’s eyes flickered toward him and away
3819,again as Harry spoke.
3820,“So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can’t
3821,think of a pretext to keep them?”
3822,"“No, it’ll be because the thirty-one days are up,” said Hermione"
3823,at once. “They can’t keep the objects longer than that unless they
3824,can prove they’re dangerous. Right?”
3825,"“Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?” asked"
3826,"Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled."
3827,“Me? Not — not really . . . It was always Harry who . . .”
3828,"Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione"
3829,"giving him a stop-talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was"
3830,done: Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he
3831,"had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey"
3832,upon Ron’s answer.
3833,"“If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account"
3834,for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exception-
3835,ally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions — his
3836,"private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects —"
3837,were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?”
3838,"“I . . . dunno,” said Ron. “I . . . when I say we weren’t close . . . I"
3839,"mean, I think he liked me. . . .”"
3840,"“You’re being modest, Ron,” said Hermione. “Dumbledore was"
3841,very fond of you.”
3842,This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry
3843,"knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and"
3844,  124   
3845,THE WILL OF
3846,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
3847,"direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrim-"
3848,geour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak
3849,and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid
3850,"had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which"
3851,he unrolled and read aloud.
3852,“ ‘The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian
3853,"Dumbledore’ . . . Yes, here we are. . . . ‘To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I"
3854,"leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when"
3855,he uses it.’ ”
3856,Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen be-
3857,"fore: It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he"
3858,"knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with"
3859,a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Delumi-
3860,"nator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in his fingers, looking"
3861,stunned.
3862,"“That is a valuable object,” said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. “It"
3863,may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore’s own design.
3864,Why would he have left you an item so rare?”
3865,"Ron shook his head, looking bewildered."
3866,"“Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,” Scrim-"
3867,geour persevered. “Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are
3868,you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put
3869,"his Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?”"
3870,"“Put out lights, I s’pose,” mumbled Ron. “What else could I do"
3871,with it?”
3872,Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron
3873,"for a moment or two, he turned back to Dumbledore’s will."
3874,"“ ‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales"
3875, 125   
3876,CHAPTER SEVEN
3877,"of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and"
3878,instructive.’ ”
3879,Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as
3880,ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding
3881,was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrim-
3882,geour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it.
3883,Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read
3884,"them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols."
3885,"“Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss"
3886,Granger?” asked Scrimgeour.
3887,"“He . . . he knew I liked books,” said Hermione in a thick voice,"
3888,mopping her eyes with her sleeve.
3889,“But why that particular book?”
3890,“I don’t know. He must have thought I’d enjoy it.”
3891,"“Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret mes-"
3892,"sages, with Dumbledore?”"
3893,"“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve."
3894,“And if the Ministry hasn’t found any hidden codes in this book in
3895,"thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.”"
3896,She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that
3897,Ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione’s
3898,shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will.
3899,"“ ‘To Harry James Potter,’ ” he read, and Harry’s insides contracted"
3900,"with a sudden excitement, “ ‘I leave the Snitch he caught in his first"
3901,"Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perse-"
3902,verance and skill.’ ”
3903,"As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its"
3904,"silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling"
3905,a definite sense of anticlimax.
3906, 126  
3907,THE WILL OF
3908,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
3909,“Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?” asked Scrimgeour.
3910,"“No idea,” said Harry. “For the reasons you just read out, I sup-"
3911,pose . . . to remind me what you can get if you . . . persevere and
3912,whatever it was.”
3913,"“You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?”"
3914,"“I suppose so,” said Harry. “What else could it be?”"
3915,"“I’m asking the questions,” said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a"
3916,little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the mar-
3917,quee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.
3918,"“I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,”"
3919,Scrimgeour said to Harry. “Why is that?”
3920,Hermione laughed derisively.
3921,"“Oh, it can’t be a reference to the fact Harry’s a great Seeker, that’s"
3922,"way too obvious,” she said. “There must be a secret message from"
3923,Dumbledore hidden in the icing!”
3924,"“I don’t think there’s anything hidden in the icing,” said Scrim-"
3925,"geour, “but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small"
3926,"object. You know why, I’m sure?”"
3927,"Harry shrugged. Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought"
3928,that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit
3929,she could not suppress the urge.
3930,"“Because Snitches have flesh memories,” she said."
3931,“What?” said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermi-
3932,one’s Quidditch knowledge negligible.
3933,"“Correct,” said Scrimgeour. “A Snitch is not touched by bare skin"
3934,"before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It"
3935,carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to
3936,"lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch” — he"
3937,"held up the tiny golden ball — “will remember your touch, Potter."
3938, 127   
3939,CHAPTER SEVEN
3940,"It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill,"
3941,"whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that"
3942,it will open only for you.”
3943,Harry’s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrim-
3944,geour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare
3945,hand in front of the Minister?
3946,"“You don’t say anything,” said Scrimgeour. “Perhaps you already"
3947,know what the Snitch contains?”
3948,"“No,” said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch"
3949,"the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency,"
3950,"really knew it, and could read Hermione’s mind; he could practi-"
3951,cally hear her brain whirring beside him.
3952,"“Take it,” said Scrimgeour quietly."
3953,Harry met the Minister’s yellow eyes and knew he had no option
3954,"but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward"
3955,"again and placed the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry’s"
3956,palm.
3957,"Nothing happened. As Harry’s fingers closed around the Snitch,"
3958,"its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Her-"
3959,"mione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball,"
3960,as if still hoping it might transform in some way.
3961,"“That was dramatic,” said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermi-"
3962,one laughed.
3963,"“That’s all, then, is it?” asked Hermione, making to prise herself"
3964,off the sofa.
3965,"“Not quite,” said Scrimgeour, who looked bad-tempered now."
3966,"“Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.”"
3967,"“What is it?” asked Harry, excitement rekindling."
3968,Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.
3969, 128 
3970,THE WILL OF

3972,"“The sword of Godric Gryffindor,” he said."
3973,Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a
3974,"sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the"
3975,"sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too"
3976,small to contain it.
3977,“So where is it?” Harry asked suspiciously.
3978,"“Unfortunately,” said Scrimgeour, “that sword was not Dumble-"
3979,dore’s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important
3980,"historical artifact, and as such, belongs —”"
3981,"“It belongs to Harry!” said Hermione hotly. “It chose him, he was"
3982,"the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat —”"
3983,"“According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present"
3984,"itself to any worthy Gryffindor,” said Scrimgeour. “That does not"
3985,"make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore"
3986,"may have decided.” Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek,"
3987,scrutinizing Harry. “Why do you think — ?”
3988,"“— Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?” said Harry,"
3989,struggling to keep his temper. “Maybe he thought it would look
3990,nice on my wall.”
3991,"“This is not a joke, Potter!” growled Scrimgeour. “Was it because"
3992,Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor
3993,could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that
3994,"sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one"
3995,destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?”
3996,"“Interesting theory,” said Harry. “Has anyone ever tried sticking"
3997,a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people
3998,"onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Delumina-"
3999,tors or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So is this what you’ve

4005,"but there’s been no word about any of that from the Ministry, has"
4006,there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!”
4007,"“You go too far!” shouted Scrimgeour, standing up; Harry jumped"
4008,to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him
4009,hard in the chest with the point of his wand: It singed a hole in
4010,Harry’s T-shirt like a lit cigarette.
4011,"“Oi!” said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry"
4012,"said,"
4013,“No! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?”
4014,"“Remembered you’re not at school, have you?” said Scrimgeour,"
4015,breathing hard into Harry’s face. “Remembered that I am not Dum-

4017,"wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-"
4018,year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It’s time you learned some
4019,respect!”
4020,"“It’s time you earned it,” said Harry."
4021,"The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then"
4022,the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley
4023,ran in.
4024,"“We — we thought we heard —” began Mr. Weasley, looking"
4025,thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtu-
4026,ally nose to nose.
4027,"“— raised voices,” panted Mrs. Weasley."
4028,"Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at"
4029,the hole he had made in Harry’s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his
4030,loss of temper.
4031,"“It — it was nothing,” he growled. “I . . . regret your attitude,” he"
4032, 130 

4035,"said, looking Harry full in the face once more. “You seem to think"
4036,that the Ministry does not desire what you — what Dumbledore
4037,— desired. We ought to be working together.”
4038,"“I don’t like your methods, Minister,” said Harry. “Remember?”"
4039,"For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to"
4040,"Scrimgeour the scars that still showed white on the back of it,"
4041,spelling I must not tell lies. Scrimgeour’s expression hardened. He
4042,turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs.
4043,Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door.
4044,"After a minute or so she called, “He’s gone!”"
4045,"“What did he want?” Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at"
4046,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back"
4047,to them.
4048,"“To give us what Dumbledore left us,” said Harry. “They’ve only"
4049,just released the contents of his will.”
4050,"Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects"
4051,Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Ev-
4052,eryone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the
4053,Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on
4054,"the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why"
4055,Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weas-
4056,"ley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs."
4057,"Weasley said tentatively, “Harry, dear, everyone’s awfully hungry, we"
4058,didn’t like to start without you. . . . Shall I serve dinner now?”
4059,"They all ate rather hurriedly and then, after a hasty chorus of"
4060,"“Happy Birthday” and much gulping of cake, the party broke up."
4061,"Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was"
4062,"far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a"
4063,tent for himself in a neighboring field.
4064, 131   
4065,CHAPTER SEVEN
4066,"“Meet us upstairs,” Harry whispered to Hermione, while they"
4067,helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. “After
4068,everyone’s gone to bed.”
4069,"Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry"
4070,"filled Hagrid’s mokeskin purse, not with gold, but with those items"
4071,"he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were: the"
4072,"Marauder’s Map, the shard of Sirius’s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.’s"
4073,locket. He pulled the strings tight and slipped the purse around his
4074,"neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter"
4075,"feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside."
4076,"“Muffliato,” she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of"
4077,the stairs.
4078,“Thought you didn’t approve of that spell?” said Ron.
4079,"“Times change,” said Hermione. “Now, show us that Delumi-"
4080,nator.”
4081,"Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it."
4082,The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.
4083,"“The thing is,” whispered Hermione through the dark, “we could"
4084,have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.”
4085,"There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew"
4086,back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.
4087,"“Still, it’s cool,” said Ron, a little defensively. “And from what"
4088,"they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!”"
4089,"“I know, but surely he wouldn’t have singled you out in his will"
4090,just to help us turn out the lights!”
4091,“D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and
4092,examine everything he’d left us?” asked Harry.
4093,"“Definitely,” said Hermione. “He couldn’t tell us in the will why"
4094,"he was leaving us these things, but that still doesn’t explain . . .”"
4095,  132   
4096,THE WILL OF
4097,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
4098,“. . . why he couldn’t have given us a hint when he was alive?”
4099,asked Ron.
4100,"“Well, exactly,” said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales"
4101,of Beedle the Bard. “If these things are important enough to pass on
4102,"right under the nose of the Ministry, you’d think he’d have let us"
4103,know why . . . unless he thought it was obvious?”
4104,"“Thought wrong, then, didn’t he?” said Ron. “I always said he"
4105,"was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry"
4106,an old Snitch — what the hell was that about?”
4107,"“I’ve no idea,” said Hermione. “When Scrimgeour made you take"
4108,"it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!”"
4109,"“Yeah, well,” said Harry, his pulse quickening as he raised the"
4110,Snitch in his fingers. “I wasn’t going to try too hard in front of
4111,"Scrimgeour, was I?”"
4112,“What do you mean?” asked Hermione.
4113,“The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?” said
4114,Harry. “Don’t you remember?”
4115,"Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, point-"
4116,ing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he
4117,found his voice.
4118,“That was the one you nearly swallowed!”
4119,"“Exactly,” said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed"
4120,his mouth to the Snitch.
4121,It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled
4122,"up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione"
4123,cried out.
4124,"“Writing! There’s writing on it, quick, look!”"
4125,He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Her-
4126,"mione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface,"
4127, 133   
4128,CHAPTER SEVEN
4129,"where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words"
4130,"written in the thin, slanting handwriting that Harry recognized as"
4131,Dumbledore’s:
4132,I open at the close.
4133,He had barely read them when the words vanished again.
4134,“ ‘I open at the close . . .’ What’s that supposed to mean?”
4135,"Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank."
4136,“I open at the close . . . at the close . . . I open at the close . . .”
4137,"But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many"
4138,"different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning"
4139,from them.
4140,"“And the sword,” said Ron finally, when they had at last aban-"
4141,doned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch’s inscription.
4142,“Why did he want Harry to have the sword?”
4143,“And why couldn’t he just have told me?” Harry said quietly. “It
4144,"was there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our"
4145,"talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn’t he just give"
4146,it to me then?”
4147,He felt as though he were sitting in an examination with a ques-
4148,"tion he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain"
4149,slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the
4150,long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all
4151,meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand?
4152,"“And as for this book,” said Hermione, “The Tales of Beedle the"
4153,Bard . . . I’ve never even heard of them!”
4154,“You’ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard ?” said Ron
4155,"incredulously. “You’re kidding, right?”"
4156, 134   
4157,THE WILL OF

4159,"“No, I’m not!” said Hermione in surprise. “Do you know them,"
4160,then?”
4161,"“Well, of course I do!”"
4162,"Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read"
4163,"a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however,"
4164,looked bemused by their surprise.
4165,"“Oh come on! All the old kids’ stories are supposed to be Beedle’s,"
4166,aren’t they? ‘The Fountain of Fair Fortune’ . . . ‘The Wizard and the
4167,Hopping Pot’ . . . ‘Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump’ . . .”
4168,"“Excuse me?” said Hermione, giggling. “What was that last"
4169,one?
4170,"“Come off it!” said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Her-"
4171,mione. “You must’ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty —”
4172,"“Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!”"
4173,"said Hermione. “We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little,"
4174,we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ —”
4175,"“What’s that, an illness?” asked Ron."
4176,"“So these are children’s stories?” asked Hermione, bending again"
4177,over the runes.
4178,"“Yeah,” said Ron uncertainly, “I mean, that’s just what you hear,"
4179,"you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what"
4180,they’re like in the original versions.”
4181,“But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?”
4182,Something creaked downstairs.
4183,"“Probably just Charlie, now Mum’s asleep, sneaking off to regrow"
4184,"his hair,” said Ron nervously."
4185,"“All the same, we should get to bed,” whispered Hermione. “It"
4186,wouldn’t do to oversleep tomorrow.”
4187, 135   
4188,CHAPTER SEVEN
4189,"“No,” agreed Ron. “A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom’s"
4190,mother might put a bit of a damper on the wedding. I’ll get the
4191,lights.”
4192,And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left
4193,the room.

4196,THE WEDDING
4197,"T       hree o’clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron,"
4198,"Fred, and George standing outside the great white marquee"
4199,"in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had"
4200,taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a
4201,"redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole,"
4202,from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The
4203,plan was to introduce Harry as “Cousin Barny” and trust to the
4204,great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him.
4205,"All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could"
4206,help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters
4207,"had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden-jacketed band, and"
4208,all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away un-
4209,der a tree; Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from
4210,the spot.
4211,"Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and"
4212,rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet.
4213, 137   
4214,CHAPTER EIGHT
4215,The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers.
4216,Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden bal-
4217,loons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly be-
4218,"come husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering"
4219,lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable.
4220,The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fat-
4221,"ter than him, and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare"
4222,of a summer’s day.
4223,"“When I get married,” said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own"
4224,"robes, “I won’t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all"
4225,"wear what you like, and I’ll put a full Body-Bind Curse on Mum"
4226,until it’s all over.”
4227,"“She wasn’t too bad this morning, considering,” said George."
4228,"“Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him? Oh"
4229,"blimey, brace yourselves — here they come, look.”"
4230,"Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one, out of no-"
4231,where at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a proces-
4232,"sion had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden"
4233,toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on
4234,"the witches’ hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the"
4235,"wizards’ cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder,"
4236,drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent.
4237,"“Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,” said George, cran-"
4238,ing his neck for a better look. “They’ll need help understanding our
4239,"English customs, I’ll look after them. . . .”"
4240,"“Not so fast, Your Holeyness,” said Fred, and darting past the"
4241,"gaggle of middle-aged witches heading the procession, he said,"
4242,"“Here — permettez-moi to assister vous,” to a pair of pretty French"
4243,"girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George"
4244, 138  
4245,THE WEDDING
4246,was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge
4247,"of Mr. Weasley’s old Ministry colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf"
4248,old couple fell to Harry’s lot.
4249,"“Wotcher,” said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee"
4250,again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She
4251,had turned blonde for the occasion. “Arthur told us you were the
4252,"one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,” she added in a"
4253,whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. “The Ministry’s being very
4254,anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence might
4255,not do you any favors.”
4256,"“It’s fine, I understand,” said Harry, speaking more to Lupin"
4257,"than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away,"
4258,Harry saw Lupin’s face fall again into lines of misery. He did not
4259,"understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter: Hagrid"
4260,was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood
4261,"Fred’s directions he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged"
4262,"and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five"
4263,seats that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.
4264,While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted
4265,"apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the"
4266,entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking
4267,"wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the tex-"
4268,"ture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of"
4269,his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An
4270,"odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden"
4271,chain around his neck.
4272,"“Xenophilius Lovegood,” he said, extending a hand to Harry, “my"
4273,"daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys"
4274,to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?” he added to Ron.
4275, 139  
4276,CHAPTER EIGHT
4277,"“Yes,” said Ron. “Isn’t she with you?”"
4278,“She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the
4279,"gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just"
4280,"how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes — or, to give"
4281,"them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.”"
4282,"“Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,” said Ron, “but I"
4283,think Fred and George taught them those.”
4284,He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up.
4285,"“Hello, Harry!” she said."
4286,"“Er — my name’s Barny,” said Harry, flummoxed."
4287,"“Oh, have you changed that too?” she asked brightly."
4288,“How did you know — ?”
4289,"“Oh, just your expression,” she said."
4290,"Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she"
4291,had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you got
4292,"over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At"
4293,least there were no radishes dangling from her ears.
4294,"Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance,"
4295,had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Bidding the
4296,"wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger"
4297,"and said, “Daddy, look — one of the gnomes actually bit me!”"
4298,“How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial!” said
4299,"Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna’s outstretched finger and examining"
4300,"the bleeding puncture marks. “Luna, my love, if you should feel"
4301,any burgeoning talent today — perhaps an unexpected urge to sing
4302,opera or to declaim in Mermish — do not repress it! You may have
4303,been gifted by the Gernumblies!”
4304,"Ron, passing them in the opposite direction, let out a loud"
4305,snort.
4306, 140   
4307,THE WEDDING
4308,"“Ron can laugh,” said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xeno-"
4309,"philius toward their seats, “but my father has done a lot of research"
4310,on Gernumbli magic.”
4311,"“Really?” said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge"
4312,Luna or her father’s peculiar views. “Are you sure you don’t want to
4313,"put anything on that bite, though?”"
4314,"“Oh, it’s fine,” said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion"
4315,and looking Harry up and down. “You look smart. I told Daddy
4316,"most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you"
4317,"ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.”"
4318,"As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly"
4319,"witch clutching his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and"
4320,feathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo.
4321,"“. . . and your hair’s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I"
4322,"thought you were Ginevra. Merlin’s beard, what is Xenophilius"
4323,Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?”
4324,she barked at Harry.
4325,"“Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.”"
4326,“Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn’t Harry Potter
4327,"here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours,"
4328,"Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?”"
4329,“No — he couldn’t come —”
4330,"“Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in"
4331,"press photographs, then. I’ve just been instructing the bride on how"
4332,"best to wear my tiara,” she shouted at Harry. “Goblin-made, you"
4333,"know, and been in my family for centuries. She’s a good-looking"
4334,"girl, but still — French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald,"
4335,I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too
4336,long.”
4337, 141   
4338,CHAPTER EIGHT
4339,Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reap-
4340,"pear for some time: When next they met at the entrance, Harry had"
4341,shown a dozen more people to their places. The marquee was nearly
4342,"full now, and for the first time there was no queue outside."
4343,"“Nightmare, Muriel is,” said Ron, mopping his forehead on his"
4344,"sleeve. “She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank"
4345,"God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dung-"
4346,bomb under her chair at dinner. Dad always says she’ll have writ-
4347,"ten them out of her will — like they care, they’re going to end up"
4348,"richer than anyone in the family, rate they’re going. . . . Wow,” he"
4349,"added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward"
4350,them. “You look great!”
4351,"“Always the tone of surprise,” said Hermione, though she smiled."
4352,"She was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high"
4353,heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. “Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn’t
4354,"agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara."
4355,"She said, ‘Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?’ and then, ‘Bad posture"
4356,and skinny ankles.’”
4357,"“Don’t take it personally, she’s rude to everyone,” said Ron."
4358,"“Talking about Muriel?” inquired George, reemerging from the"
4359,"marquee with Fred. “Yeah, she’s just told me my ears are lopsided."
4360,"Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a"
4361,right laugh at weddings.”
4362,“Wasn’t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours
4363,later?” asked Hermione.
4364,"“Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,” conceded"
4365,George.
4366,"“But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,”"
4367,"said Fred. “He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run"

4371,of flowers out of his —”
4372,"“Yes, he sounds a real charmer,” said Hermione, while Harry"
4373,roared with laughter.
4374,"“Never married, for some reason,” said Ron."
4375,"“You amaze me,” said Hermione."
4376,They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the
4377,"latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and"
4378,"thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and"
4379,"said, with his eyes on Hermione, “You look vunderful.”"
4380,"“Viktor!” she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which"
4381,made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scram-
4382,"bled, blushing, to pick it up, she said, “I didn’t know you were —"
4383,goodness — it’s lovely to see — how are you?”
4384,Ron’s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum’s
4385,"invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too"
4386,"loudly, “How come you’re here?”"
4387,"“Fleur invited me,” said Krum, eyebrows raised."
4388,"Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then,"
4389,feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron’s vicin-
4390,"ity, offered to show him his seat."
4391,"“Your friend is not pleased to see me,” said Krum as they entered"
4392,the now packed marquee. “Or is he a relative?” he added with a
4393,glance at Harry’s red curly hair.
4394,"“Cousin,” Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening."
4395,"His appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela"
4396,"cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people"
4397,"were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Her-"

4401,"“Time to sit down,” Fred told Harry, “or we’re going to get run"
4402,over by the bride.”
4403,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione took their seats in the second row"
4404,behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron’s
4405,"ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry,"
4406,“Did you see he’s grown a stupid little beard?”
4407,Harry gave a noncommittal grunt.
4408,"A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the gen-"
4409,eral murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter.
4410,"Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at"
4411,relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst-
4412,colored robes with a matching hat.
4413,A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the mar-
4414,"quee, both wearing dress robes, with large white roses in their but-"
4415,tonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling
4416,from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled
4417,from what seemed to be the golden balloons.
4418,"“Ooooh!” said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look"
4419,at the entrance.
4420,A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and
4421,"wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle,"
4422,"Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur"
4423,was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a
4424,"strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone"
4425,"else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny"
4426,"and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier"
4427,"than usual, and once Fleur had reached him, Bill did not look as"
4428,though he had ever met Fenrir Greyback.
4429,"“Ladies and gentlemen,” said a slightly singsong voice, and with"
4430, 144 
4431,THE WEDDING
4432,"a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-haired wizard who"
4433,"had presided at Dumbledore’s funeral, now standing in front of Bill"
4434,and Fleur. “We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of
4435,two faithful souls . . .”
4436,"“Yes, my tiara sets off the whole thing nicely,” said Auntie Muriel"
4437,"in a rather carrying whisper. “But I must say, Ginevra’s dress is far"
4438,too low cut.”
4439,"Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly"
4440,faced the front again. Harry’s mind wandered a long way from the
4441,"marquee, back to afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts"
4442,of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always
4443,"seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shin-"
4444,"ing hours from a normal person’s life, a person without a lightning-"
4445,shaped scar on his forehead. . . .
4446,"“Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle . . . ?”"
4447,"In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both"
4448,sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the
4449,back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one
4450,of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned and
4451,beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.
4452,“. . . then I declare you bonded for life.”
4453,The tufty-haired wizard waved his wand high over the heads of
4454,"Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling"
4455,around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round
4456,"of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst: Birds of paradise"
4457,"and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their"
4458,songs and chimes to the din.
4459,“Ladies and gentlemen!” called the tufty-haired wizard. “If you
4460,would please stand up!”
4461, 145   
4462,CHAPTER EIGHT
4463,"They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his"
4464,wand again. The seats on which they had been sitting rose grace-
4465,"fully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so"
4466,"that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with"
4467,a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside.
4468,"Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to"
4469,form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped them-
4470,"selves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated grace-"
4471,"fully back to earth around it, and the golden-jacketed band trooped"
4472,toward a podium.
4473,"“Smooth,” said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all"
4474,"sides, some bearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and"
4475,"firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches."
4476,"“We should go and congratulate them!” said Hermione, standing"
4477,on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid
4478,a crowd of well-wishers.
4479,"“We’ll have time later,” shrugged Ron, snatching three butter-"
4480,"beers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. “Hermione, cop"
4481,"hold, let’s grab a table. . . . Not there! Nowhere near Muriel —”"
4482,"Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and"
4483,right as he went: Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for
4484,"Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee,"
4485,most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where
4486,Luna sat alone.
4487,“All right if we join you?” asked Ron.
4488,"“Oh yes,” she said happily. “Daddy’s just gone to give Bill and"
4489,Fleur our present.”
4490,"“What is it, a lifetime’s supply of Gurdyroots?” asked Ron."
4491,"Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry"
4492, 146   
4493,THE WEDDING
4494,"instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation"
4495,for a few moments.
4496,The band had begun to play. Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor
4497,"first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Dela-"
4498,"cour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur’s father."
4499,"“I like this song,” said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike"
4500,"tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance"
4501,"floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and"
4502,waving her arms.
4503,"“She’s great, isn’t she?” said Ron admiringly. “Always good"
4504,value.”
4505,But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had
4506,dropped into Luna’s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flus-
4507,"tered, but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a"
4508,"scowl on his face he said, “Who is that man in the yellow?”"
4509,"“That’s Xenophilius Lovegood, he’s the father of a friend of ours,”"
4510,said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about
4511,"to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. “Come and"
4512,"dance,” he added abruptly to Hermione."
4513,"She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They van-"
4514,ished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.
4515,"“Ah, they are together now?” asked Krum, momentarily"
4516,distracted.
4517,"“Er — sort of,” said Harry."
4518,“Who are you?” Krum asked.
4519,“Barny Weasley.”
4520,They shook hands.
4521,"“You, Barny — you know this man Lovegood vell?”"
4522,"“No, I only met him today. Why?”"
4523, 147   
4524,CHAPTER EIGHT
4525,"Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophil-"
4526,"ius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the"
4527,dance floor.
4528,"“Because,” said Krum, “if he vos not a guest of Fleur’s, I vould duel"
4529,"him, here and now, for vearing that filthy sign upon his chest.”"
4530,"“Sign?” said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange"
4531,triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. “Why? What’s wrong
4532,with it?”
4533,“Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald’s sign.”
4534,“Grindelwald . . . the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?”
4535,“Exactly.”
4536,"Krum’s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said,"
4537,"“Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of"
4538,"course, he vos never poverful in this country, they said he feared"
4539,"Dumbledore — and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this” —"
4540,"he pointed a finger at Xenophilius — “this is his symbol, I recognized"
4541,it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ven he
4542,"vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes,"
4543,"thinking to shock, make themselves impressive — until those of us"
4544,who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.”
4545,Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophil-
4546,ius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna’s
4547,"father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent"
4548,"seemed to have recognized the triangular, runelike shape."
4549,“Are you — er — quite sure it’s Grindelwald’s — ?”
4550,"“I am not mistaken,” said Krum coldly. “I valked past that sign"
4551,"for several years, I know it vell.”"
4552,"“Well, there’s a chance,” said Harry, “that Xenophilius doesn’t"
4553,actually know what the symbol means. The Lovegoods are quite . . .

4555,THE WEDDING
4556,unusual. He could easily have picked it up somewhere and think it’s
4557,a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or
4558,something.”
4559,“The cross section of a vot?”
4560,"“Well, I don’t know what they are, but apparently he and his"
4561,daughter go on holiday looking for them. . . .”
4562,Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her
4563,father.
4564,"“That’s her,” he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing"
4565,"alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting"
4566,to beat off midges.
4567,“Vy is she doing that?” asked Krum.
4568,"“Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,” said Harry, who"
4569,recognized the symptoms.
4570,Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making
4571,fun of him. He drew his wand from inside his robes and tapped it
4572,menacingly on his thigh; sparks flew out of the end.
4573,"“Gregorovitch!” said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry"
4574,was too excited to care; the memory had come back to him at the
4575,sight of Krum’s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it care-
4576,fully before the Triwizard Tournament.
4577,“Vot about him?” asked Krum suspiciously.
4578,“He’s a wandmaker!”
4579,"“I know that,” said Krum."
4580,“He made your wand! That’s why I thought — Quidditch —”
4581,Krum was looking more and more suspicious.
4582,“How do you know Gregorovitch made my vand?”
4583,"“I . . . I read it somewhere, I think,” said Harry. “In a — a fan"
4584,"magazine,” he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified."
4585,  149   
4586,CHAPTER EIGHT
4587,"“I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,” he"
4588,said.
4589,“So . . . er . . . where is Gregorovitch these days?”
4590,Krum looked puzzled.
4591,“He retired several years ago. I vos one of the last to purchase a
4592,"Gregorovitch vand. They are the best — although I know, of course,"
4593,that you Britons set much store by Ollivander.”
4594,"Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like"
4595,"Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for"
4596,"a celebrated wandmaker, and Harry did not have to search far for a"
4597,reason: It was surely because of what Harry’s wand had done on the
4598,night that Voldemort had pursued him across the skies. The holly
4599,"and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some-"
4600,thing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would
4601,Gregorovitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Olli-
4602,"vander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?"
4603,"“This girl is very nice-looking,” Krum said, recalling Harry to his"
4604,"surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined"
4605,Luna. “She is also a relative of yours?”
4606,"“Yeah,” said Harry, suddenly irritated, “and she’s seeing someone."
4607,Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn’t want to cross him.”
4608,Krum grunted.
4609,"“Vot,” he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again,"
4610,“is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the
4611,good-looking girls are taken?”
4612,"And he strode off, leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a pass-"
4613,ing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance
4614,"floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but"
4615,Ron was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor.
4616, 150  
4617,THE WEDDING
4618,Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched
4619,"Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George’s friend Lee"
4620,"Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given"
4621,Ron.
4622,"He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge"
4623,"how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he"
4624,was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake
4625,topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake
4626,"was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through"
4627,"the crowd. As evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under"
4628,"the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became"
4629,more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since dis-
4630,"appeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur’s cousins; Charlie,"
4631,"Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing"
4632,“Odo the Hero” in a corner.
4633,Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of
4634,"Ron’s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry"
4635,spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair
4636,made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped
4637,"by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains,"
4638,"Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the"
4639,Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore’s obituary.
4640,Harry approached him.
4641,“May I sit down?”
4642,"“Of course, of course,” said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched,"
4643,wheezy voice.
4644,Harry leaned in.
4645,"“Mr. Doge, I’m Harry Potter.”"
4646,Doge gasped.
4647, 151   
4648,CHAPTER EIGHT
4649,"“My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. . . . I am"
4650,"so glad, so honored!”"
4651,In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of
4652,champagne.
4653,"“I thought of writing to you,” he whispered, “after Dumbledore"
4654,". . . the shock . . . and for you, I am sure . . .”"
4655,Doge’s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.
4656,"“I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,’’ said Harry."
4657,“I didn’t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.”
4658,"“As well as anyone,” said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin."
4659,"“Certainly I knew him longest, if you don’t count Aberforth — and"
4660,"somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.”"
4661,“Speaking of the Daily Prophet . . . I don’t know whether you
4662,"saw, Mr. Doge — ?”"
4663,"“Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.”"
4664,"“Elphias, I don’t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter"
4665,gave about Dumbledore?”
4666,Doge’s face flooded with angry color.
4667,"“Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more"
4668,"accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her. I am ashamed to"
4669,"say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which"
4670,"resulted, as you may have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.”"
4671,"“Well, in that interview,” Harry went on, “Rita Skeeter hinted"
4672,that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he
4673,was young.”
4674,"“Don’t believe a word of it!” said Doge at once. “Not a word, Harry!"
4675,Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!”
4676,"Harry looked into Doge’s earnest, pained face and felt, not reas-"
4677,"sured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that"
4678, 152  
4679,THE WEDDING
4680,Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn’t Doge understand
4681,"Harry’s need to be sure, to know everything?"
4682,"Perhaps Doge suspected Harry’s feelings, for he looked concerned"
4683,"and hurried on, “Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful —”"
4684,But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.
4685,"“Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!”"
4686,"Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there,"
4687,"the plumes dancing on her hat, a goblet of champagne in her hand."
4688,"“She’s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!”"
4689,"“Hello, Muriel,” said Doge. “Yes, we were just discussing —”"
4690,"“You there! Give me your chair, I’m a hundred and seven!”"
4691,"Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, look-"
4692,"ing alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising"
4693,strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and
4694,Harry.
4695,"“Hello again, Barry, or whatever your name is,” she said to Harry."
4696,"“Now, what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know"
4697,"she’s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can’t wait to read it, I"
4698,must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!”
4699,"Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained"
4700,her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a re-
4701,"placement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched, and"
4702,"then said, “There’s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before"
4703,"he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were"
4704,some mighty funny rumors about Albus!”
4705,"“Ill-informed sniping,” said Doge, turning radish-colored"
4706,again.
4707,"“You would say that, Elphias,” cackled Auntie Muriel. “I noticed"
4708,how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!”
4709, 153   
4710,CHAPTER EIGHT
4711,"“I’m sorry you think so,” said Doge, more coldly still. “I assure"
4712,you I was writing from the heart.”
4713,"“Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you’ll"
4714,still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away
4715,with his Squib sister!”
4716,“Muriel !” exclaimed Doge.
4717,A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was
4718,stealing through Harry’s chest.
4719,“What do you mean?” he asked Muriel. “Who said his sister was
4720,a Squib? I thought she was ill?”
4721,"“Thought wrong, then, didn’t you, Barry!” said Auntie Muriel,"
4722,"looking delighted at the effect she had produced. “Anyway, how"
4723,could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened years
4724,"and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth"
4725,is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really hap-
4726,pened. That’s why I can’t wait to find out what Skeeter’s unearthed!
4727,Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!”
4728,“Untrue!” wheezed Doge. “Absolutely untrue!”
4729,"“He never told me his sister was a Squib,” said Harry, without"
4730,"thinking, still cold inside."
4731,"“And why on earth would he tell you?” screeched Muriel, swaying"
4732,a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.
4733,"“The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,” began Elphias in"
4734,"a voice stiff with emotion, “is, I should have thought, quite clear."
4735,He was so devastated by her death —”
4736,"“Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?” squawked Muriel."
4737,"“Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they car-"
4738,ried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where
4739,was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being

4742,"brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his"
4743,own house!”
4744,"“What d’you mean, locked in the cellar?” asked Harry. “What"
4745,is this?”
4746,Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and an-
4747,swered Harry.
4748,"“Dumbledore’s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying."
4749,"Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise —”"
4750,“She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine
4751,"woman,” whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored"
4752,him.
4753,"“— proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would"
4754,have been mortified to produce a Squib —”
4755,“Ariana was not a Squib!” wheezed Doge.
4756,"“So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended"
4757,Hogwarts!” said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. “In our
4758,"day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the extreme"
4759,of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she
4760,didn’t exist —”
4761,"“I tell you, that’s not what happened!” said Doge, but Auntie"
4762,"Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry."
4763,“Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encour-
4764,aged to integrate into the Muggle community . . . much kinder than
4765,"trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must"
4766,always be second class; but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn’t
4767,have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school —”
4768,“Ariana was delicate!” said Doge desperately. “Her health was
4769,always too poor to permit her —”
4770,“— to permit her to leave the house?” cackled Muriel. “And yet
4771, 155    
4772,CHAPTER EIGHT
4773,she was never taken to St. Mungo’s and no Healer was ever sum-
4774,moned to see her!”
4775,"“Really, Muriel, how you can possibly know whether —”"
4776,"“For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer"
4777,"at St. Mungo’s at the time, and he told my family in strictest con-"
4778,"fidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious,"
4779,Lancelot thought!”
4780,"Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who"
4781,"seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for"
4782,more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had
4783,"once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for"
4784,the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore’s sister suffered the
4785,same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had
4786,"Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts,"
4787,to prove himself brilliant and talented?
4788,"“Now, if Kendra hadn’t died first,” Muriel resumed, “I’d have"
4789,said that it was she who finished off Ariana —”
4790,"“How can you, Muriel?” groaned Doge. “A mother kill her own"
4791,daughter? Think what you are saying!”
4792,“If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daugh-
4793,"ter for years on end, why not?” shrugged Auntie Muriel. “But as"
4794,"I say, it doesn’t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana — of what,"
4795,nobody ever seemed sure —”
4796,"“Oh, no doubt Ariana murdered her,” said Doge with a brave"
4797,attempt at scorn. “Why not?”
4798,"“Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and"
4799,"killed Kendra in the struggle,” said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully."
4800,"“Shake your head all you like, Elphias! You were at Ariana’s funeral,"
4801,were you not?”
4802, 156 
4803,THE WEDDING
4804,"“Yes I was,” said Doge, through trembling lips. “And a more desper-"
4805,ately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken —”
4806,“His heart wasn’t the only thing. Didn’t Aberforth break Albus’s
4807,nose halfway through the service?”
4808,"If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he"
4809,looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and
4810,"took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin."
4811,“How do you — ?” croaked Doge.
4812,"“My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,” said Auntie"
4813,Muriel happily. “Bathilda described the whole thing to Mother while
4814,I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl! The way Bathilda
4815,"told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus’s fault that Ariana"
4816,"was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda,"
4817,"Albus did not even defend himself, and that’s odd enough in itself,"
4818,Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands
4819,tied behind his back.”
4820,Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of these old
4821,scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry
4822,"did not know what to think, what to believe: He wanted the truth,"
4823,and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had
4824,been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not
4825,"have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house,"
4826,and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.
4827,"“And I’ll tell you something else,” Muriel said, hiccuping slightly"
4828,as she lowered her goblet. “I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to
4829,Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter’s interview about an impor-
4830,tant source close to the Dumbledores — goodness knows she was
4831,"there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!”"
4832,“Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!” whispered Doge.
4833, 157  
4834,CHAPTER EIGHT
4835,“Bathilda Bagshot?” Harry said. “The author of A History of
4836,Magic?”
4837,The name was printed on the front of one of Harry’s text-
4838,"books, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read most"
4839,attentively.
4840,"“Yes,” said Doge, clutching at Harry’s question like a drown-"
4841,ing man at a life belt. “A most gifted magical historian and an old
4842,friend of Albus’s.”
4843,"“Quite gaga these days, I’ve heard,” said Auntie Muriel cheer-"
4844,fully.
4845,"“If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have"
4846,"taken advantage of her,” said Doge, “and no reliance can be placed"
4847,on anything Bathilda may have said!”
4848,"“Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I’m sure Rita"
4849,"Skeeter knows them all,” said Auntie Muriel. “But even if Bathilda’s"
4850,"completely cuckoo, I’m sure she’d still have old photographs, maybe"
4851,even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. . . . Well worth
4852,"a trip to Godric’s Hollow, I’d have thought.”"
4853,"Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge"
4854,"banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Mu-"
4855,"riel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again,"
4856,"he asked, “Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow?”"
4857,"“Oh yes, she’s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there"
4858,"after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.”"
4859,“The Dumbledores lived in Godric’s Hollow?”
4860,"“Yes, Barry, that’s what I just said,” said Auntie Muriel testily."
4861,"Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dum-"
4862,bledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones
4863,in Godric’s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to
4864, 158   
4865,THE WEDDING
4866,Dumbledore’s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their
4867,"graves, perhaps walked past Lily’s and James’s to do so? And he had"
4868,never once told Harry . . . never bothered to say . . .
4869,"And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to"
4870,"himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him"
4871,that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared
4872,"ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and"
4873,did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until
4874,she drew up a chair beside him.
4875,"“I simply can’t dance anymore,” she panted, slipping off one of"
4876,her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. “Ron’s gone looking to
4877,"find more butterbeers. It’s a bit odd, I’ve just seen Viktor storming"
4878,"away from Luna’s father, it looked like they’d been arguing —” She"
4879,"dropped her voice, staring at him. “Harry, are you okay?”"
4880,"Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter. At"
4881,"that moment, something large and silver came falling through the"
4882,"canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed"
4883,"lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as"
4884,those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus’s
4885,"mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of"
4886,Kingsley Shacklebolt.
4887,“The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.”

4889,CHAPTER NINE
4890,A PLACE TO HIDE
4891,"E     verything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and Hermione jumped"
4892,to their feet and drew their wands. Many people were only
4893,just realizing that something strange had happened; heads were still
4894,turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. Silence spread outward
4895,in cold ripples from the place where the Patronus had landed. Then
4896,somebody screamed.
4897,Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd.
4898,Guests were sprinting in all directions; many were Disapparating;
4899,the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken.
4900,"“Ron!” Hermione cried. “Ron, where are you?”"
4901,"As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw"
4902,cloaked and masked figures appearing in the crowd; then he saw
4903,"Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them shout,"
4904,"“Protego!”, a cry that was echoed on all sides —"
4905,"“Ron! Ron!” Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry"
4906,were buffeted by terrified guests: Harry seized her hand to make
4907, 160  
4908,A PLACE TO HIDE
4909,sure they weren’t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their
4910,"heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he"
4911,did not know —
4912,And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione’s free
4913,"arm, and Harry felt her turn on the spot; sight and sound were ex-"
4914,tinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was
4915,"Hermione’s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away"
4916,"from the Burrow, away from the descending Death Eaters, away,"
4917,"perhaps, from Voldemort himself. . . ."
4918,“Where are we?” said Ron’s voice.
4919,Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not
4920,left the wedding after all: They still seemed to be surrounded by
4921,people.
4922,"“Tottenham Court Road,” panted Hermione. “Walk, just walk,"
4923,we need to find somewhere for you to change.”
4924,"Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide"
4925,dark street thronged with late-night revelers and lined with closed
4926,"shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus rumbled by"
4927,and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry
4928,and Ron were still wearing dress robes.
4929,"“Hermione, we haven’t got anything to change into,” Ron told her,"
4930,as a young woman burst into raucous giggles at the sight of him.
4931,“Why didn’t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?”
4932,"said Harry, inwardly cursing his own stupidity. “All last year I kept"
4933,it on me and —”
4934,"“It’s okay, I’ve got the Cloak, I’ve got clothes for both of you,”"
4935,said Hermione. “Just try and act naturally until — this will do.”
4936,"She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shad-"
4937,owy alleyway.
4938, 161   
4939,CHAPTER NINE
4940,"“When you say you’ve got the Cloak, and clothes . . .” said Harry,"
4941,"frowning at Hermione, who was carrying nothing except her small"
4942,"beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging."
4943,"“Yes, they’re here,” said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron’s ut-"
4944,"ter astonishment, she pulled out a pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some"
4945,"maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak."
4946,“How the ruddy hell — ?”
4947,"“Undetectable Extension Charm,” said Hermione. “Tricky, but I"
4948,"think I’ve done it okay; anyway, I managed to fit everything we need"
4949,in here.” She gave the fragile-looking bag a little shake and it echoed
4950,like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside
4951,"it. “Oh, damn, that’ll be the books,” she said, peering into it, “and I"
4952,"had them all stacked by subject. . . . Oh well. . . . Harry, you’d better"
4953,"take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change. . . .”"
4954,“When did you do all this?” Harry asked as Ron stripped off his
4955,robes.
4956,"“I told you at the Burrow, I’ve had the essentials packed for days,"
4957,"you know, in case we needed to make a quick getaway. I packed"
4958,"your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put it"
4959,in here. . . . I just had a feeling. . . .”
4960,"“You’re amazing, you are,” said Ron, handing her his bundled-"
4961,up robes.
4962,"“Thank you,” said Hermione, managing a small smile as she"
4963,"pushed the robes into the bag. “Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!”"
4964,Harry threw the Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and
4965,"pulled it up over his head, vanishing from sight. He was only just"
4966,beginning to appreciate what had happened.
4967,“The others — everyone at the wedding —”
4968, 162     
4969,A PLACE TO HIDE
4970,"“We can’t worry about that now,” whispered Hermione. “It’s you"
4971,"they’re after, Harry, and we’ll just put everyone in even more danger"
4972,by going back.”
4973,"“She’s right,” said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was"
4974,"about to argue, even if he could not see his face. “Most of the Order"
4975,"was there, they’ll look after everyone.”"
4976,"Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him,"
4977,"and said, “Yeah.” But he thought of Ginny, and fear bubbled like"
4978,acid in his stomach.
4979,"“Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,” said Hermione."
4980,"They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again,"
4981,where a group of men on the opposite side was singing and weaving
4982,across the pavement.
4983,"“Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?” Ron"
4984,asked Hermione.
4985,"“I’ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I’m sure we’re safer"
4986,"out in the Muggle world, it’s not where they’ll expect us to be.”"
4987,"“True,” said Ron, looking around, “but don’t you feel a bit"
4988,— exposed?”
4989,"“Where else is there?” asked Hermione, cringing as the men on"
4990,the other side of the road started wolf-whistling at her. “We can
4991,"hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And Grimmauld"
4992,Place is out if Snape can get in there. . . . I suppose we could try my
4993,"parents’ house, though I think there’s a chance they might check"
4994,"there. . . . Oh, I wish they’d shut up!”"
4995,"“All right, darling?” the drunkest of the men on the other pave-"
4996,ment was yelling. “Fancy a drink? Ditch ginger and come and have
4997,a pint!”
4998, 163  
4999,CHAPTER NINE
5000,"“Let’s sit down somewhere,” Hermione said hastily as Ron opened"
5001,"his mouth to shout back across the road. “Look, this will do, in"
5002,here!”
5003,It was a small and shabby all-night café. A light layer of grease
5004,"lay on all the Formica-topped tables, but it was at least empty."
5005,Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite
5006,"Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it:"
5007,She glanced over her shoulder so frequently she appeared to have a
5008,twitch. Harry did not like being stationary; walking had given the
5009,illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the
5010,"last vestiges of Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their"
5011,usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses out of his pocket and
5012,put them on again.
5013,"After a minute or two, Ron said, “You know, we’re not far from"
5014,"the Leaky Cauldron here, it’s only in Charing Cross —”"
5015,"“Ron, we can’t!” said Hermione at once."
5016,"“Not to stay there, but to find out what’s going on!”"
5017,"“We know what’s going on! Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry,"
5018,what else do we need to know?”
5019,"“Okay, okay, it was just an idea!”"
5020,They relapsed into a prickly silence. The gum-chewing waitress
5021,shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos: As Harry
5022,"was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of"
5023,burly workmen entered the café and squeezed into the next booth.
5024,Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper.
5025,“I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the coun-
5026,"tryside. Once we’re there, we could send a message to the Order.”"
5027,"“Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?” asked Ron."
5028,"“I’ve been practicing and I think so,” said Hermione."
5029, 164   
5030,A PLACE TO HIDE
5031,"“Well, as long as it doesn’t get them into trouble, though they"
5032,"might’ve been arrested already. God, that’s revolting,” Ron added"
5033,"after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had heard;"
5034,she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new cus-
5035,"tomers’ orders. The larger of the two workmen, who was blond and"
5036,"quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved her away."
5037,"She stared, affronted."
5038,"“Let’s get going, then, I don’t want to drink this muck,” said Ron."
5039,"“Hermione, have you got Muggle money to pay for this?”"
5040,"“Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to"
5041,"the Burrow. I’ll bet all the change is at the bottom,” sighed Hermi-"
5042,"one, reaching for her beaded bag."
5043,"The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mir-"
5044,rored them without conscious thought: All three of them drew
5045,"their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going"
5046,"on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her"
5047,bench. The force of the Death Eaters’ spells shattered the tiled wall
5048,"where Ron’s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, yelled,"
5049,“Stupefy!”
5050,The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red
5051,"light: He slumped sideways, unconscious. His companion, unable"
5052,"to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron: Shining black"
5053,ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot — the
5054,waitress screamed and ran for the door — Harry sent another Stun-
5055,ning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had tied up
5056,"Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the"
5057,"waitress, who collapsed in front of the door."
5058,"“Expulso!” bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which"
5059,Harry was standing blew up: The force of the explosion slammed
5060,  165  
5061,CHAPTER NINE
5062,him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the Cloak
5063,slipped off him.
5064,"“Petrificus Totalus!” screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the"
5065,Death Eater fell forward like a statue to land with a crunching thud
5066,"on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. Hermione crawled"
5067,"out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of"
5068,her hair and trembling all over.
5069,"“D-diffindo,” she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in"
5070,"pain as she slashed open the knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut."
5071,"“Oh, I’m so sorry, Ron, my hand’s shaking! Diffindo!”"
5072,"The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms"
5073,to regain feeling in them. Harry picked up his wand and climbed
5074,over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was sprawled
5075,across the bench.
5076,"“I should’ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore"
5077,"died,” he said. He turned over the darker Death Eater with his foot;"
5078,"the man’s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron, and Hermione."
5079,"“That’s Dolohov,” said Ron. “I recognize him from the old wanted"
5080,posters. I think the big one’s Thorfinn Rowle.”
5081,“Never mind what they’re called!” said Hermione a little hysteri-
5082,cally. “How did they find us? What are we going to do?”
5083,Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry’s head.
5084,"“Lock the door,” he told her, “and Ron, turn out the lights.”"
5085,"He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the"
5086,lock clicked and Ron used the Deluminator to plunge the café into
5087,darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at Hermione
5088,"earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance."
5089,“What are we going to do with them?” Ron whispered to Harry
5090,  166  
5091,A PLACE TO HIDE
5092,"through the dark; then, even more quietly, “Kill them? They’d kill"
5093,us. They had a good go just now.”
5094,Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook
5095,his head.
5096,"“We just need to wipe their memories,” said Harry. “It’s better"
5097,"like that, it’ll throw them off the scent. If we killed them it’d be"
5098,obvious we were here.”
5099,"“You’re the boss,” said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. “But"
5100,I’ve never done a Memory Charm.”
5101,"“Nor have I,” said Hermione, “but I know the theory.”"
5102,"She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolo-"
5103,"hov’s forehead and said, “Obliviate.”"
5104,"At once, Dolohov’s eyes became unfocused and dreamy."
5105,"“Brilliant!” said Harry, clapping her on the back. “Take care of"
5106,the other one and the waitress while Ron and I clear up.”
5107,"“Clear up?” said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed"
5108,café. “Why?”
5109,“Don’t you think they might wonder what’s happened if they
5110,wake up and find themselves in a place that looks like it’s just been
5111,bombed?”
5112,"“Oh right, yeah . . .”"
5113,Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand
5114,from his pocket.
5115,"“It’s no wonder I can’t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old"
5116,"jeans, they’re tight.”"
5117,"“Oh, I’m so sorry,” hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the"
5118,"waitress out of sight of the windows, Harry heard her mutter a sug-"
5119,gestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead.
5120, 167   
5121,CHAPTER NINE
5122,"Once the café was restored to its previous condition, they heaved"
5123,the Death Eaters back into their booth and propped them up fac-
5124,ing each other.
5125,"“But how did they find us?” Hermione asked, looking from one"
5126,inert man to the other. “How did they know where we were?”
5127,She turned to Harry.
5128,"“You — you don’t think you’ve still got your Trace on you, do"
5129,"you, Harry?”"
5130,"“He can’t have,” said Ron. “The Trace breaks at seventeen, that’s"
5131,"Wizarding law, you can’t put it on an adult.”"
5132,"“As far as you know,” said Hermione. “What if the Death Eaters"
5133,have found a way to put it on a seventeen-year-old?”
5134,“But Harry hasn’t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four
5135,hours. Who’s supposed to have put a Trace back on him?”
5136,"Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted: Was"
5137,that really how the Death Eaters had found them?
5138,"“If I can’t use magic, and you can’t use magic near me, without"
5139,us giving away our position —” he began.
5140,“We’re not splitting up!” said Hermione firmly.
5141,"“We need a safe place to hide,” said Ron. “Give us time to think"
5142,things through.”
5143,"“Grimmauld Place,” said Harry."
5144,The other two gaped.
5145,"“Don’t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!”"
5146,“Ron’s dad said they’ve put up jinxes against him — and even if
5147,"they haven’t worked,” he pressed on as Hermione began to argue,"
5148,"“so what? I swear, I’d like nothing better than to meet Snape!”"
5149,“But —”
5150,"“Hermione, where else is there? It’s the best chance we’ve got."
5151, 168  
5152,A PLACE TO HIDE
5153,"Snape’s only one Death Eater. If I’ve still got the Trace on me, we’ll"
5154,have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.”
5155,"She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked"
5156,"to. While she unlocked the café door, Ron clicked the Delumina-"
5157,"tor to release the café’s light. Then, on Harry’s count of three, they"
5158,"reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress"
5159,"or either of the Death Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry,"
5160,"Ron, and Hermione had turned on the spot and vanished into the"
5161,compressing darkness once more.
5162,Seconds later Harry’s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened
5163,his eyes: They were now standing in the middle of a familiar small
5164,"and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down on them"
5165,"from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had"
5166,"been told of its existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they"
5167,"rushed toward it, checking every few yards that they were not be-"
5168,"ing followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry"
5169,tapped the front door once with his wand. They heard a series of
5170,"metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then the door swung open"
5171,with a creak and they hurried over the threshold.
5172,"As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas"
5173,"lamps sprang into life, casting flickering light along the length of the"
5174,"hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it: eerie, cobwebbed,"
5175,the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shad-
5176,ows up the staircase. Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of
5177,Sirius’s mother. The only thing that was out of place was the troll’s
5178,"leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just"
5179,knocked it over again.
5180,"“I think somebody’s been in here,” Hermione whispered, point-"
5181,ing toward it.
5182, 169  
5183,CHAPTER NINE
5184,"“That could’ve happened as the Order left,” Ron murmured"
5185,back.
5186,“So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?” Harry
5187,asked.
5188,“Maybe they’re only activated if he shows up?” suggested Ron.
5189,"Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against"
5190,"the door, scared to move farther into the house."
5191,"“Well, we can’t stay here forever,” said Harry, and he took a step"
5192,forward.
5193,“Severus Snape?”
5194,"Mad-Eye Moody’s voice whispered out of the darkness, making"
5195,all three of them jump back in fright. “We’re not Snape!” croaked
5196,"Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his"
5197,"tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak."
5198,"Before he had time to feel inside his mouth, however, his tongue"
5199,had unraveled again.
5200,The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant
5201,"sensation. Ron was making retching noises; Hermione stammered,"
5202,“That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse Mad-Eye set
5203,up for Snape!”
5204,Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted
5205,"in the shadows at the end of the hall, and before any of them could"
5206,"say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, dust-"
5207,"colored, and terrible: Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black,"
5208,"her curtains flying open; the gray figure was gliding toward them,"
5209,"faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming behind it,"
5210,"its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets: Horribly familiar,"
5211,"dreadfully altered, it raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry."
5212, 170   
5213,A PLACE TO HIDE
5214,"“No!” Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell"
5215,occurred to him. “No! It wasn’t us! We didn’t kill you —”
5216,"On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust:"
5217,"Coughing, his eyes watering, Harry looked around to see Hermione"
5218,"crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her head, and"
5219,"Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on"
5220,"the shoulder and saying, “It’s all r-right. . . . It’s g-gone. . . .”"
5221,"Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight,"
5222,as Mrs. Black continued to scream.
5223,"“Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of"
5224,my fathers —”
5225,"“SHUT UP!” Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and"
5226,"with a bang and a burst of red sparks, the curtains swung shut"
5227,"again, silencing her."
5228,"“That . . . that was . . .” Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped"
5229,her to her feet.
5230,"“Yeah,” said Harry, “but it wasn’t really him, was it? Just some-"
5231,thing to scare Snape.”
5232,"Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted"
5233,the horror-figure aside as casually as he had killed the real Dumble-
5234,"dore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-"
5235,"expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except"
5236,for a mouse skittering along the skirting board.
5237,"“Before we go any farther, I think we’d better check,” whispered"
5238,"Hermione, and she raised her wand and said, “Homenum revelio.”"
5239,Nothing happened.
5240,"“Well, you’ve just had a big shock,” said Ron kindly. “What was"
5241,that supposed to do?”
5242, 171   
5243,CHAPTER NINE
5244,“It did what I meant it to do!” said Hermione rather crossly.
5245,"“That was a spell to reveal human presence, and there’s nobody"
5246,here except us!”
5247,"“And old Dusty,” said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from"
5248,which the corpse-figure had risen.
5249,"“Let’s go up,” said Hermione with a frightened look at the same"
5250,"spot, and she led the way up the creaking stairs to the drawing room"
5251,on the first floor.
5252,"Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then,"
5253,"shivering slightly in the drafty room, she perched on the sofa, her"
5254,arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window and
5255,moved the heavy velvet curtain aside an inch.
5256,"“Can’t see anyone out there,” he reported. “And you’d think, if"
5257,"Harry still had a Trace on him, they’d have followed us here. I know"
5258,"they can’t get in the house, but — what’s up, Harry?”"
5259,Harry had given a cry of pain: His scar had burned again as some-
5260,thing flashed across his mind like a bright light on water. He saw a
5261,large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound through
5262,"his body, violent and brief as an electric shock."
5263,"“What did you see?” Ron asked, advancing on Harry. “Did you"
5264,see him at my place?”
5265,"“No, I just felt anger — he’s really angry —”"
5266,"“But that could be at the Burrow,” said Ron loudly. “What else?"
5267,Didn’t you see anything? Was he cursing someone?”
5268,"“No, I just felt anger — I couldn’t tell —”"
5269,"Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she"
5270,"said in a frightened voice, “Your scar, again? But what’s going on? I"
5271,thought that connection had closed!”
5272,"“It did, for a while,” muttered Harry; his scar was still painful,"
5273, 172  
5274,A PLACE TO HIDE
5275,which made it hard to concentrate. “I — I think it’s started opening
5276,"again whenever he loses control, that’s how it used to —”"
5277,“But then you’ve got to close your mind!” said Hermione shrilly.
5278,"“Harry, Dumbledore didn’t want you to use that connection, he"
5279,"wanted you to shut it down, that’s why you were supposed to use"
5280,Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your
5281,"mind, remember —”"
5282,"“Yeah, I do remember, thanks,” said Harry through gritted teeth;"
5283,he did not need Hermione to tell him that Voldemort had once used
5284,"this selfsame connection between them to lead him into a trap, nor"
5285,that it had resulted in Sirius’s death. He wished that he had not told
5286,them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threaten-
5287,"ing, as though he were pressing against the window of the room,"
5288,and still the pain in his scar was building and he fought it: It was
5289,like resisting the urge to be sick.
5290,"He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to exam-"
5291,ine the old tapestry of the Black family tree on the wall. Then Her-
5292,mione shrieked: Harry drew his wand again and spun around to see
5293,a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land
5294,"upon the floor in front of them, where it solidified into the weasel"
5295,that spoke with the voice of Ron’s father.
5296,"“Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.”"
5297,The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise be-
5298,tween a whimper and a groan and dropped onto the sofa: Hermione
5299,"joined him, gripping his arm."
5300,"“They’re all right, they’re all right!” she whispered, and Ron half"
5301,laughed and hugged her.
5302,"“Harry,” he said over Hermione’s shoulder, “I —”"
5303,"“It’s not a problem,” said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head."
5304, 173   
5305,CHAPTER NINE
5306,"“It’s your family, ’course you’re worried. I’d feel the same way.” He"
5307,thought of Ginny. “I do feel the same way.”
5308,"The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had done"
5309,"in the garden of the Burrow. Faintly he heard Hermione say, “I don’t"
5310,want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags I’ve brought
5311,and camp in here tonight?”
5312,He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer:
5313,He had to succumb.
5314,"“Bathroom,” he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could"
5315,without running.
5316,He barely made it: Bolting the door behind him with trembling
5317,"hands, he grasped his pounding head and fell to the floor, then in"
5318,"an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him"
5319,"possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the great"
5320,"blond Death Eater on the floor, screaming and writhing, and a"
5321,"slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry"
5322,"spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice."
5323,"“More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord"
5324,Voldemort is not sure that he will forgive this time. . . . You called
5325,"me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again?"
5326,"Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure. . . . Do it, or"
5327,feel my wrath yourself!”
5328,"A log fell in the fire: Flames reared, their light darting across a"
5329,"terrified, pointed white face — with a sense of emerging from deep"
5330,"water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes."
5331,"He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose"
5332,inches from one of the silver serpent tails that supported the large
5333,"bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy’s gaunt, petrified face seemed branded"
5334, 174   
5335,A PLACE TO HIDE
5336,"on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen,"
5337,by the use to which Draco was now being put by Voldemort.
5338,"There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermi-"
5339,one’s voice rang out.
5340,"“Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I’ve got it here.”"
5341,"“Yeah, great, thanks,” he said, fighting to keep his voice casual"
5342,as he stood up to let her in.

5345,KREACHER’S TALE
5346,"H           arry woke early next morning, wrapped in a sleeping"
5347,bag on the drawing room floor. A chink of sky was vis-
5348,"ible between the heavy curtains: It was the cool, clear blue of watered"
5349,"ink, somewhere between night and dawn, and everything was quiet"
5350,"except for Ron and Hermione’s slow, deep breathing. Harry glanced"
5351,over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron
5352,had had a fit of gallantry and insisted that Hermione sleep on the
5353,"cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above his."
5354,"Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron’s. Harry"
5355,wondered whether they had fallen asleep holding hands. The idea
5356,made him feel strangely lonely.
5357,"He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chande-"
5358,"lier. Less than twenty-four hours ago, he had been standing in the"
5359,"sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in wed-"
5360,ding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen
5361,"now? He lay on the floor and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the"
5362,  176  
5363,KREACHER’S TALE
5364,"daunting, complex mission Dumbledore had left him. . . . Dumble-"
5365,dore . . .
5366,The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore’s death felt
5367,different now. The accusations he had heard from Muriel at the
5368,"wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things,"
5369,infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dum-
5370,"bledore have let such things happen? Had he been like Dudley,"
5371,content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect him?
5372,Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being impris-
5373,oned and hidden?
5374,"Harry thought of Godric’s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had"
5375,never mentioned there; he thought of mysterious objects left with-
5376,"out explanation in Dumbledore’s will, and resentment swelled in"
5377,the darkness. Why hadn’t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn’t he
5378,explained? Had Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or
5379,"had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be polished and honed,"
5380,"but not trusted, never confided in?"
5381,Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter
5382,"thoughts for company. Desperate for something to do, for distrac-"
5383,"tion, he slipped out of his sleeping bag, picked up his wand, and"
5384,"crept out of the room. On the landing he whispered, “Lumos,” and"
5385,started to climb the stairs by wandlight.
5386,On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron
5387,had slept last time they had been here; he glanced into it. The ward-
5388,robe doors stood open and the bedclothes had been ripped back.
5389,Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody
5390,had searched the house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps
5391,"Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this house both before"
5392,and after Sirius died? Harry’s gaze wandered to the portrait that
5393, 177  
5394,CHAPTER TEN
5395,"sometimes contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius’s great-great-"
5396,"grandfather, but it was empty, showing nothing but a stretch of"
5397,muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night
5398,in the headmaster’s study at Hogwarts.
5399,Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost
5400,"landing, where there were only two doors. The one facing him"
5401,bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his
5402,"godfather’s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding"
5403,his wand high to cast light as widely as possible. The room was
5404,spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large
5405,"bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured"
5406,"by long velvet curtains, and a chandelier thickly coated in dust"
5407,"with candle stubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging"
5408,in frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the
5409,walls and the bed’s headboard; a spider’s web stretched between
5410,"the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as"
5411,"Harry moved deeper into the room, he heard a scurrying of dis-"
5412,turbed mice.
5413,The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many post-
5414,ers and pictures that little of the walls’ silvery-gray silk was visible.
5415,Harry could only assume that Sirius’s parents had been unable to
5416,"remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall,"
5417,because he was sure they would not have appreciated their eldest
5418,son’s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have gone out of his way
5419,"to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners,"
5420,"faded scarlet and gold, just to underline his difference from all the"
5421,rest of the Slytherin family. There were many pictures of Muggle
5422,"motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius’s nerve) several"
5423, 178 
5424,KREACHER’S TALE
5425,posters of bikini-clad Muggle girls; Harry could tell that they were
5426,Muggles because they remained quite stationary within their pic-
5427,"tures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in"
5428,"contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls, which was"
5429,"a picture of four Hogwarts students standing arm in arm, laughing"
5430,at the camera.
5431,"With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father; his untidy"
5432,"black hair stuck up at the back like Harry’s, and he too wore glasses."
5433,"Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly arrogant face"
5434,so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To
5435,"Sirius’s right stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and"
5436,"watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his inclusion in this coolest"
5437,"of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had"
5438,"been. On James’s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking,"
5439,but he had the same air of delighted surprise at finding himself liked
5440,and included . . . or was it simply because Harry knew how it had
5441,"been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from"
5442,"the wall; it was his now, after all, Sirius had left him everything, but"
5443,it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in preventing his
5444,parents from redecorating his room.
5445,Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was grow-
5446,"ing brighter: A shaft of light revealed bits of paper, books, and"
5447,small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius’s bedroom
5448,"had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been"
5449,"judged mostly, if not entirely, worthless. A few of the books had"
5450,"been shaken roughly enough to part company with their covers,"
5451,and sundry pages littered the floor.
5452,"Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and"
5453,  179    
5454,CHAPTER TEN
5455,examined them. He recognized one as part of an old edition of
5456,"A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as belonging"
5457,to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten
5458,and crumpled. He smoothed it out.
5459,"Dear Padfoot,"
5460,"Thank you, thank you, for Harry’s birthday present! It"
5461,was his favorite by far. One year old and already zooming
5462,"along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself,"
5463,I’m enclosing a picture so you can see. You know it only
5464,"rises about two feet off the ground, but he nearly killed the"
5465,cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for
5466,"Christmas (no complaints there). Of course, James thought it"
5467,"was so funny, says he’s going to be a great Quidditch player,"
5468,but we’ve had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure
5469,we don’t take our eyes off him when he gets going.
5470,"We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old"
5471,"Bathilda, who has always been sweet to us and who dotes on"
5472,"Harry. We were so sorry you couldn’t come, but the Order’s"
5473,"got to come first, and Harry’s not old enough to know"
5474,it’s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated
5475,"shut up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell — also,"
5476,"Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so no chance"
5477,"of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him"
5478,"up so much. Wormy was here last weekend, I thought he"
5479,"seemed down, but that was probably the news about the"
5480,McKinnons; I cried all evening when I heard.
5481,"Bathilda drops in most days, she’s a fascinating old thing"
5482,"with the most amazing stories about Dumbledore, I’m not"
5483, 180  
5484,KREACHER’S TALE
5485,sure he’d be pleased if he knew! I don’t know how much to
5486,"believe, actually, because it seems incredible that Dumbledore"
5487,Harry’s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite
5488,"still, holding the miraculous paper in his nerveless fingers while"
5489,inside him a kind of quiet eruption sent joy and grief thundering
5490,"in equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat"
5491,down.
5492,"He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning"
5493,"than he had done the first time, and was reduced to staring at the"
5494,handwriting itself. She had made her “g”s the same way he did: He
5495,"searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like"
5496,a friendly little wave glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an
5497,"incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, really lived, that"
5498,"her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink"
5499,"into these letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son."
5500,"Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the"
5501,"letter, this time concentrating on the meaning. It was like listening"
5502,to a half-remembered voice.
5503,"They had had a cat . . . perhaps it had perished, like his parents, at"
5504,Godric’s Hollow . . . or else fled when there was nobody left to feed
5505,it. . . . Sirius had bought him his first broomstick. . . . His parents
5506,had known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them?
5507,Dumbledore’s still got his Invisibility Cloak . . . There was something
5508,funny there. . . .
5509,"Harry paused, pondering his mother’s words. Why had Dum-"
5510,bledore taken James’s Invisibility Cloak? Harry distinctly remem-
5511,"bered his headmaster telling him years before, “I don’t need a cloak"
5512,to become invisible.” Perhaps some less gifted Order member had
5513,  181  
5514,CHAPTER TEN
5515,"needed its assistance, and Dumbledore had acted as carrier? Harry"
5516,passed on. . . .
5517,"Wormy was here . . . Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed “down,”"
5518,had he? Was he aware that he was seeing James and Lily alive for
5519,the last time?
5520,"And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about"
5521,Dumbledore. It seems incredible that Dumbledore —
5522,That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things
5523,that would seem incredible about Dumbledore; that he had once
5524,"received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance, or"
5525,had taken up goat-charming like Aberforth. . . .
5526,Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor: Perhaps the rest of
5527,"the letter was here somewhere. He seized papers, treating them, in"
5528,"his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original searcher;"
5529,"he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run"
5530,"his hand over the top of the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed"
5531,and armchair.
5532,"At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like"
5533,a torn piece of paper under the chest of drawers. When he pulled it
5534,"out, it proved to be most of the photograph Lily had described in"
5535,her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the pic-
5536,"ture on a tiny broom, roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that"
5537,must have belonged to James was chasing after him. Harry tucked
5538,the photograph into his pocket with Lily’s letter and continued to
5539,look for the second sheet.
5540,"After another quarter of an hour, however, he was forced to"
5541,conclude that the rest of his mother’s letter was gone. Had it sim-
5542,ply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had
5543,"been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the"
5544, 182  
5545,KREACHER’S TALE
5546,"room? Harry read the first sheet again, this time looking for clues"
5547,as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy
5548,broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death
5549,Eaters. . . . The only potentially useful thing he could see here
5550,was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that
5551,Dumbledore — what?
5552,“Harry? Harry! Harry!”
5553,“I’m here!” he called. “What’s happened?”
5554,"There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione"
5555,burst inside.
5556,“We woke up and didn’t know where you were!” she said breath-
5557,"lessly. She turned and shouted over her shoulder, “Ron! I’ve found"
5558,him!”
5559,Ron’s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.
5560,“Good! Tell him from me he’s a git!”
5561,"“Harry, don’t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did"
5562,you come up here anyway?” She gazed around the ransacked room.
5563,“What have you been doing?”
5564,“Look what I’ve just found.”
5565,He held out his mother’s letter. Hermione took it and read it
5566,while Harry watched her. When she reached the end of the page
5567,she looked up at him.
5568,"“Oh, Harry . . .”"
5569,“And there’s this too.”
5570,"He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the"
5571,baby zooming in and out of sight on the toy broom.
5572,"“I’ve been looking for the rest of the letter,” Harry said, “but it’s"
5573,not here.”
5574,Hermione glanced around.
5575, 183    
5576,CHAPTER TEN
5577,"“Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you"
5578,got here?”
5579,"“Someone had searched before me,” said Harry."
5580,“I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been

5582,"“Information on the Order, if it was Snape.”"
5583,"“But you’d think he’d already have all he needed, I mean, he was"
5584,"in the Order, wasn’t he?”"
5585,"“Well then,” said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, “what about"
5586,"information on Dumbledore? The second page of this letter, for"
5587,"instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know"
5588,who she is?”
5589,“Who?”
5590,"“Bathilda Bagshot, the author of —”"
5591,"“A History of Magic,” said Hermione, looking interested. “So your"
5592,parents knew her? She was an incredible magical historian.”
5593,"“And she’s still alive,” said Harry, “and she lives in Godric’s Hol-"
5594,"low, Ron’s Auntie Muriel was talking about her at the wedding."
5595,She knew Dumbledore’s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk
5596,"to, wouldn’t she?”"
5597,There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermi-
5598,one gave him for Harry’s liking. He took back the letter and the
5599,"photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so"
5600,as not to have to look at her and give himself away.
5601,“I understand why you’d love to talk to her about your mum and
5602,"dad, and Dumbledore too,” said Hermione. “But that wouldn’t re-"
5603,"ally help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?” Harry did"
5604,"not answer, and she rushed on, “Harry, I know you really want to"
5605,"go to Godric’s Hollow, but I’m scared, I’m scared at how easily those"

5608,Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just makes me feel more than
5609,"ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried,"
5610,I’m sure they’d be expecting you to visit it.”
5611,"“It’s not just that,” Harry said, still avoiding looking at her. “Mur-"
5612,iel said stuff about Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the
5613,truth. . . .”
5614,He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When
5615,"he had finished, Hermione said, “Of course, I can see why that’s"
5616,"upset you, Harry —”"
5617,"“I’m not upset,” he lied, “I’d just like to know whether or not it’s"
5618,true or —”
5619,"“Harry, do you really think you’ll get the truth from a malicious"
5620,"old woman like Muriel, or from Rita Skeeter? How can you believe"
5621,them? You knew Dumbledore!”
5622,"“I thought I did,” he muttered."
5623,“But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita
5624,"wrote about you! Doge is right, how can you let these people tarnish"
5625,your memories of Dumbledore?”
5626,"He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There"
5627,it was again: Choose what to believe. He wanted the truth. Why
5628,was everybody so determined that he should not get it?
5629,“Shall we go down to the kitchen?” Hermione suggested after a
5630,little pause. “Find something for breakfast?”
5631,"He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the land-"
5632,ing and past the second door that led off it. There were deep scratch
5633,marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not noticed
5634,in the dark. He paused at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a
5635,"pompous little sign, neatly lettered by hand, the sort of thing that"
5636,Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door:

5638,CHAPTER TEN
5639,Do Not Enter
5640,Without the Express Permission of
5641,Regulus Arcturus Black
5642,"Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately"
5643,sure why. He read the sign again. Hermione was already a flight of
5644,stairs below him.
5645,"“Hermione,” he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so"
5646,calm. “Come back up here.”
5647,“What’s the matter?”
5648,“R.A.B. I think I’ve found him.”
5649,"There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs."
5650,“In your mum’s letter? But I didn’t see —”
5651,"Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus’s sign. She read it, then"
5652,clutched Harry’s arm so tightly that he winced.
5653,“Sirius’s brother?” she whispered.
5654,"“He was a Death Eater,” said Harry, “Sirius told me about him,"
5655,he joined up when he was really young and then got cold feet and
5656,tried to leave — so they killed him.”
5657,“That fits!” gasped Hermione. “If he was a Death Eater he had
5658,"access to Voldemort, and if he became disenchanted, then he would"
5659,have wanted to bring Voldemort down!”
5660,"She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, “Ron!"
5661,"RON! Get up here, quick!”"
5662,"Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his"
5663,hand.
5664,“What’s up? If it’s massive spiders again I want breakfast
5665,before I —”
5666, 186  
5667,KREACHER’S TALE
5668,"He frowned at the sign on Regulus’s door, to which Hermione"
5669,was silently pointing.
5670,"“What? That was Sirius’s brother, wasn’t it? Regulus Arcturus . . ."
5671,Regulus . . . R.A.B.! The locket — you don’t reckon — ?”
5672,"“Let’s find out,” said Harry. He pushed the door: It was locked."
5673,"Hermione pointed her wand at the handle and said, “Alohomora.”"
5674,"There was a click, and the door swung open."
5675,"They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus’s"
5676,"bedroom was slightly smaller than Sirius’s, though it had the same"
5677,sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought to advertise
5678,"his difference from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to"
5679,emphasize the opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver
5680,"were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, and the windows. The"
5681,"Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along"
5682,"with its motto, Toujours Pur. Beneath this was a collection of"
5683,"yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck together to make a ragged col-"
5684,lage. Hermione crossed the room to examine them.
5685,"“They’re all about Voldemort,” she said. “Regulus seems to have"
5686,been a fan for a few years before he joined the Death Eaters. . . .”
5687,A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to
5688,"read the clippings. Harry, meanwhile, had noticed another photo-"
5689,graph; a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving out
5690,of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on
5691,their chests: Slytherins. Regulus was instantly recognizable as the
5692,boy sitting in the middle of the front row: He had the same dark
5693,"hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller,"
5694,"slighter, and rather less handsome than Sirius had been."
5695,"“He played Seeker,” said Harry."
5696, 187 
5697,CHAPTER TEN
5698,“What?” said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Vol-
5699,demort’s press clippings.
5700,"“He’s sitting in the middle of the front row, that’s where the"
5701,"Seeker . . . Never mind,” said Harry, realizing that nobody was"
5702,"listening: Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the"
5703,wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places
5704,"and approached the desk. Yet again, somebody had searched before"
5705,"them. The drawers’ contents had been turned over recently, the"
5706,"dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there: old quills, out-"
5707,"of-date textbooks that bore evidence of being roughly handled, a"
5708,"recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the contents"
5709,of the drawer.
5710,"“There’s an easier way,” said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky"
5711,"fingers on his jeans. She raised her wand and said, “Accio Locket!”"
5712,"Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of"
5713,"the faded curtains, looked disappointed."
5714,"“Is that it, then? It’s not here?”"
5715,"“Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,”"
5716,"said Hermione. “Charms to prevent it being summoned magically,"
5717,you know.”
5718,"“Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,” said Harry, re-"
5719,membering how he had been unable to Summon the fake locket.
5720,“How are we supposed to find it then?” asked Ron.
5721,"“We search manually,” said Hermione."
5722,"“That’s a good idea,” said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed"
5723,his examination of the curtains.
5724,"They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but"
5725,"were forced, finally, to conclude that the locket was not there."
5726,  188 
5727,KREACHER’S TALE
5728,The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the
5729,grimy landing windows.
5730,"“It could be somewhere else in the house, though,” said Hermi-"
5731,one in a rallying tone as they walked back downstairs: As Harry
5732,"and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have become"
5733,"more determined. “Whether he’d managed to destroy it or not, he’d"
5734,"want to keep it hidden from Voldemort, wouldn’t he? Remember"
5735,all those awful things we had to get rid of when we were here last
5736,time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes
5737,that tried to strangle Ron; Regulus might have put them there to
5738,"protect the locket’s hiding place, even though we didn’t realize it"
5739,at . . . at . . .”
5740,Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in
5741,"midair, with the dumbstruck look of one who had just been Oblivi-"
5742,ated; her eyes had even drifted out of focus.
5743,"“. . . at the time,” she finished in a whisper."
5744,“Something wrong?” asked Ron.
5745,“There was a locket.”
5746,“What?” said Harry and Ron together.
5747,“In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And
5748,we . . . we . . .”
5749,Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into
5750,his stomach. He remembered: He had even handled the thing as
5751,"they passed it around, each trying in turn to prise it open. It had"
5752,"been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wart-"
5753,cap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy. . . .
5754,"“Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,” said Harry. It"
5755,"was the only chance, the only slender hope left to them, and he was"
5756, 189  
5757,CHAPTER TEN
5758,going to cling to it until forced to let go. “He had a whole stash of
5759,stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C’mon.”
5760,"He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two"
5761,thundering along in his wake. They made so much noise that they
5762,woke the portrait of Sirius’s mother as they passed through the hall.
5763,“Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!” she screamed after them as they dashed
5764,down into the basement kitchen and slammed the door behind
5765,them.
5766,"Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at the door"
5767,"of Kreacher’s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest"
5768,"of dirty old blankets in which the house-elf had once slept, but"
5769,they were no longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher had sal-
5770,vaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature’s Nobility: A
5771,"Wizarding Genealogy. Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched"
5772,up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell out and rolled
5773,dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a
5774,kitchen chair; Hermione closed her eyes.
5775,"“It’s not over yet,” said Harry, and he raised his voice and called,"
5776,“Kreacher!”
5777,There was a loud crack and the house-elf that Harry had so re-
5778,luctantly inherited from Sirius appeared out of nowhere in front of
5779,"the cold and empty fireplace: tiny, half human-sized, his pale skin"
5780,"hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his"
5781,batlike ears. He was still wearing the filthy rag in which they had
5782,"first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon Harry"
5783,showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no
5784,more than his outfit.
5785,"“Master,” croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog’s voice, and he bowed"
5786, 190   
5787,KREACHER’S TALE
5788,"low, muttering to his knees, “back in my Mistress’s old house with"
5789,the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood —”
5790,"“I forbid you to call anyone ‘blood traitor’ or ‘Mudblood,’ ”"
5791,"growled Harry. He would have found Kreacher, with his snoutlike"
5792,"nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctly unlovable object even if the"
5793,elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort.
5794,"“I’ve got a question for you,” said Harry, his heart beating rather"
5795,"fast as he looked down at the elf, “and I order you to answer it truth-"
5796,fully. Understand?”
5797,"“Yes, Master,” said Kreacher, bowing low again: Harry saw his"
5798,"lips moving soundlessly, undoubtedly framing the insults he was"
5799,now forbidden to utter.
5800,"“Two years ago,” said Harry, his heart now hammering against"
5801,"his ribs, “there was a big gold locket in the drawing room upstairs."
5802,We threw it out. Did you steal it back?”
5803,"There was a moment’s silence, during which Kreacher straight-"
5804,"ened up to look Harry full in the face. Then he said, “Yes.”"
5805,“Where is it now?” asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione
5806,looked gleeful.
5807,Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their
5808,reactions to his next word.
5809,“Gone.”
5810,"“Gone?” echoed Harry, elation flooding out of him. “What do"
5811,"you mean, it’s gone?”"
5812,The elf shivered. He swayed.
5813,"“Kreacher,” said Harry fiercely, “I order you —”"
5814,"“Mundungus Fletcher,” croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut."
5815,“Mundungus Fletcher stole it all: Miss Bella’s and Miss Cissy’s
5816, 191   
5817,CHAPTER TEN
5818,"pictures, my Mistress’s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, the"
5819,"goblets with the family crest, and — and —”"
5820,Kreacher was gulping for air: His hollow chest was rising and
5821,"falling rapidly, then his eyes flew open and he uttered a bloodcur-"
5822,dling scream.
5823,"“— and the locket, Master Regulus’s locket, Kreacher did wrong,"
5824,Kreacher failed in his orders!”
5825,Harry reacted instinctively: As Kreacher lunged for the poker
5826,"standing in the grate, he launched himself upon the elf, flatten-"
5827,"ing him. Hermione’s scream mingled with Kreacher’s, but Harry"
5828,"bellowed louder than both of them: “Kreacher, I order you to stay"
5829,still!”
5830,He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the
5831,"cold stone floor, tears gushing from his sagging eyes."
5832,"“Harry, let him up!” Hermione whispered."
5833,"“So he can beat himself up with the poker?” snorted Harry, kneel-"
5834,"ing beside the elf. “I don’t think so. Right, Kreacher, I want the"
5835,truth: How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the locket?”
5836,“Kreacher saw him!” gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout
5837,and into his mouth full of graying teeth. “Kreacher saw him com-
5838,ing out of Kreacher’s cupboard with his hands full of Kreacher’s
5839,"treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus"
5840,Fletcher laughed and r-ran. . . .”
5841,"“You called the locket ‘Master Regulus’s,’ ” said Harry. “Why?"
5842,Where did it come from? What did Regulus have to do with it?
5843,"Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket,"
5844,and everything Regulus had to do with it!”
5845,"The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between"
5846,"his knees, and began to rock backward and forward. When he"
5847, 192  
5848,KREACHER’S TALE
5849,"spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, echo-"
5850,ing kitchen.
5851,"“Master Sirius ran away, good riddance, for he was a bad boy and"
5852,broke my Mistress’s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regu-
5853,lus had proper pride; he knew what was due to the name of Black
5854,and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the Dark
5855,"Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the"
5856,Muggles and the Muggle-borns . . . and when he was sixteen years
5857,"old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so proud, so"
5858,happy to serve . . .
5859,"“And one day, a year after he had joined, Master Regulus came"
5860,down to the kitchen to see Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked
5861,Kreacher. And Master Regulus said . . . he said . . .
5862,The old elf rocked faster than ever.
5863,“. . . he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.”
5864,"“Voldemort needed an elf ?” Harry repeated, looking around at"
5865,"Ron and Hermione, who looked just as puzzled as he did."
5866,"“Oh yes,” moaned Kreacher. “And Master Regulus had volun-"
5867,"teered Kreacher. It was an honor, said Master Regulus, an honor for"
5868,"him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the Dark"
5869,Lord ordered him to do . . . and then to c-come home.”
5870,"Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs."
5871,“So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell
5872,"Kreacher what they were to do, but took Kreacher with him to a"
5873,"cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave there was a cavern, and in"
5874,the cavern was a great black lake . . .”
5875,The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck stood up. Kreacher’s croak-
5876,ing voice seemed to come to him from across that dark water. He
5877,saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been present.
5878, 193   
5879,CHAPTER TEN
5880,“. . . There was a boat . . .”
5881,"Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly"
5882,"green and tiny, bewitched so as to carry one wizard and one victim"
5883,"toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort"
5884,had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux: by borrowing a
5885,"disposable creature, a house-elf . . ."
5886,“There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark
5887,Lord made Kreacher drink it. . . .”
5888,The elf quaked from head to foot.
5889,"“Kreacher drank, and as he drank, he saw terrible things. . . ."
5890,Kreacher’s insides burned. . . . Kreacher cried for Master Regulus
5891,"to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only"
5892,laughed. . . . He made Kreacher drink all the potion. . . . He dropped
5893,a locket into the empty basin. . . . He filled it with more potion.
5894,"“And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the"
5895,island. . . .”
5896,"Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort’s white,"
5897,"snakelike face vanishing into darkness, those red eyes fixed piti-"
5898,"lessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within minutes,"
5899,whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning po-
5900,"tion caused its victim. . . . But here, Harry’s imagination could go"
5901,"no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had escaped."
5902,"“Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island’s edge and he"
5903,"drank from the black lake . . . and hands, dead hands, came out of"
5904,the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface. . . .”
5905,"“How did you get away?” Harry asked, and he was not surprised"
5906,to hear himself whispering.
5907,"Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked at Harry with his great,"
5908,bloodshot eyes.
5909, 194 
5910,KREACHER’S TALE
5911,"“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he said."
5912,“I know — but how did you escape the Inferi?”
5913,Kreacher did not seem to understand.
5914,"“Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,” he repeated."
5915,"“I know, but —”"
5916,"“Well, it’s obvious, isn’t it, Harry?” said Ron. “He Disappa-"
5917,rated!”
5918,"“But . . . you couldn’t Apparate in and out of that cave,” said"
5919,"Harry, “otherwise Dumbledore —”"
5920,"“Elf magic isn’t like wizard’s magic, is it?” said Ron. “I mean,"
5921,they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when
5922,we can’t.”
5923,There was silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort
5924,"have made such a mistake? But even as he thought this, Hermione"
5925,"spoke, and her voice was icy."
5926,"“Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-"
5927,"elves far beneath his notice, just like all the purebloods who treat"
5928,them like animals. . . . It would never have occurred to him that
5929,they might have magic that he didn’t.”
5930,"“The house-elf ’s highest law is his Master’s bidding,” intoned"
5931,"Kreacher. “Kreacher was told to come home, so Kreacher came"
5932,home. . . .”
5933,"“Well, then, you did what you were told, didn’t you?” said Her-"
5934,mione kindly. “You didn’t disobey orders at all!”
5935,"Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever."
5936,“So what happened when you got back?” Harry asked. “What
5937,did Regulus say when you told him what had happened?”
5938,"“Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,” croaked"
5939,Kreacher. “Master Regulus told Kreacher to stay hidden and not to
5940,  195  
5941,CHAPTER TEN
5942,leave the house. And then . . . it was a little while later . . . Master
5943,"Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Mas-"
5944,"ter Regulus was strange, not as he usually was, disturbed in his mind,"
5945,Kreacher could tell . . . and he asked Kreacher to take him to the
5946,"cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord. . . .”"
5947,"And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly,"
5948,"the frightened old elf and the thin, dark Seeker who had so resem-"
5949,bled Sirius. . . . Kreacher knew how to open the concealed entrance
5950,"to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat; this"
5951,time it was his beloved Regulus who sailed with him to the island
5952,with its basin of poison. . . .
5953,"“And he made you drink the potion?” said Harry, disgusted."
5954,But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione’s hands leapt
5955,to her mouth: She seemed to have understood something.
5956,“M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one
5957,"the Dark Lord had,” said Kreacher, tears pouring down either side"
5958,"of his snoutlike nose. “And he told Kreacher to take it and, when"
5959,"the basin was empty, to switch the lockets. . . .”"
5960,Kreacher’s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concen-
5961,trate hard to understand him.
5962,“And he ordered — Kreacher to leave — without him. And
5963,he told Kreacher — to go home — and never to tell my Mistress
5964,— what he had done — but to destroy — the first locket. And he
5965,drank — all the potion — and Kreacher swapped the lockets —
5966,and watched . . . as Master Regulus . . . was dragged beneath the
5967,water . . . and . . .”
5968,"“Oh, Kreacher!” wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped"
5969,to her knees beside the elf and tried to hug him. At once he was on
5970,"his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed."

5973,"“The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what"
5974,would his Mistress say?”
5975,"“I told you not to call her ‘Mudblood’!” snarled Harry, but the"
5976,elf was already punishing himself: He fell to the ground and banged
5977,his forehead on the floor.
5978,"“Stop him — stop him!” Hermione cried. “Oh, don’t you see"
5979,"now how sick it is, the way they’ve got to obey?”"
5980,"“Kreacher — stop, stop!” shouted Harry."
5981,"The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glis-"
5982,"tening around his snout, a bruise already blooming on his pallid"
5983,"forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and blood-"
5984,shot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so
5985,pitiful.
5986,"“So you brought the locket home,” he said relentlessly, for he was"
5987,determined to know the full story. “And you tried to destroy it?”
5988,"“Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,” moaned the"
5989,"elf. “Kreacher tried everything, everything he knew, but nothing,"
5990,"nothing would work. . . . So many powerful spells upon the casing,"
5991,"Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it"
5992,"would not open. . . . Kreacher punished himself, he tried again, he"
5993,"punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey orders,"
5994,Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his Mistress was mad
5995,"with grief, because Master Regulus had disappeared, and Kreacher"
5996,"could not tell her what had happened, no, because Master Regulus"
5997,had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened
5998,in the c-cave. . . .”
5999,Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coher-
6000,ent words. Tears flowed down Hermione’s cheeks as she watched
6001,"Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who was"
6002, 197  
6003,CHAPTER TEN
6004,"no fan of Kreacher’s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels"
6005,"and shook his head, trying to clear it."
6006,"“I don’t understand you, Kreacher,” he said finally. “Voldemort"
6007,"tried to kill you, Regulus died to bring Voldemort down, but you"
6008,were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy to
6009,"go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort"
6010,through them. . . .”
6011,"“Harry, Kreacher doesn’t think like that,” said Hermione, wip-"
6012,ing her eyes on the back of her hand. “He’s a slave; house-elves are
6013,"used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to Kreacher"
6014,wasn’t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean
6015,"to an elf like Kreacher? He’s loyal to people who are kind to him,"
6016,"and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus certainly was, so he"
6017,served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you’re
6018,"going to say,” she went on as Harry began to protest, “that Regulus"
6019,changed his mind . . . but he doesn’t seem to have explained that to
6020,"Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and Regulus’s"
6021,family were all safer if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus
6022,was trying to protect them all.”
6023,“Sirius —”
6024,"“Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it’s no good looking"
6025,"like that, you know it’s true. Kreacher had been alone for a long time"
6026,"when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably starving for a"
6027,bit of affection. I’m sure ‘Miss Cissy’ and ‘Miss Bella’ were perfectly
6028,"lovely to Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and"
6029,told them everything they wanted to know. I’ve said all along that
6030,"wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort"
6031,did . . . and so did Sirius.”
6032,Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the
6033, 198   
6034,KREACHER’S TALE
6035,"floor, he remembered what Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours"
6036,after Sirius’s death: I do not think Sirius ever saw Kreacher as a being
6037,with feelings as acute as a human’s. . . .
6038,"“Kreacher,” said Harry after a while, “when you feel up to it, er"
6039,. . . please sit up.”
6040,It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccuped himself into si-
6041,"lence. Then he pushed himself into a sitting position again, rubbing"
6042,his knuckles into his eyes like a small child.
6043,"“Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,” said Harry."
6044,He glanced at Hermione for assistance. He wanted to give the order
6045,"kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it was not"
6046,"an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained"
6047,her approval: She smiled encouragingly.
6048,"“Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher."
6049,We need to find out where the locket — where Master Regulus’s
6050,locket is. It’s really important. We want to finish the work Master
6051,"Regulus started, we want to — er — ensure that he didn’t die in"
6052,vain.”
6053,Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.
6054,“Find Mundungus Fletcher?” he croaked.
6055,"“And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,” said Harry. “Do you"
6056,think you could do that for us?”
6057,"As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden"
6058,inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid’s purse and took out the fake
6059,"Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note"
6060,to Voldemort.
6061,"“Kreacher, I’d, er, like you to have this,” he said, pressing the"
6062,locket into the elf ’s hand. “This belonged to Regulus and I’m sure
6063,he’d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you —”

6066,"“Overkill, mate,” said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket,"
6067,"let out a howl of shock and misery, and threw himself back onto"
6068,the ground.
6069,"It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who"
6070,was so overcome to be presented with a Black family heirloom for
6071,his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly.
6072,When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied
6073,"him to his cupboard, watched him tuck up the locket safely in his"
6074,"dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its protec-"
6075,tion their first priority while he was away. He then made two low
6076,"bows to Harry and Ron, and even gave a funny little spasm in Her-"

6078,"salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack."

6082,"I    f Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, Harry was confident"
6083,"that the capture of Mundungus would take a few hours at most,"
6084,and he prowled the house all morning in a state of high anticipation.
6085,"However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that after-"
6086,"noon. By nightfall, Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper"
6087,"composed largely of moldy bread, upon which Hermione had tried a"
6088,"variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help."
6089,"Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that."
6090,"However, two cloaked men had appeared in the square outside num-"
6091,"ber twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the"
6092,direction of the house that they could not see.
6093,"“Death Eaters, for sure,” said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione"
6094,watched from the drawing room windows. “Reckon they know
6095,we’re in here?”
6096,"“I don’t think so,” said Hermione, though she looked frightened,"
6097,"“or they’d have sent Snape in after us, wouldn’t they?”"
6098,  201   
6099,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6100,“D’you reckon he’s been in here and had his tongue tied by
6101,Moody’s curse?” asked Ron.
6102,"“Yes,” said Hermione, “otherwise he’d have been able to tell that"
6103,"lot how to get in, wouldn’t he? But they’re probably watching to see"
6104,"whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, after"
6105,all.”
6106,“How do they — ?” began Harry.
6107,"“Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember?"
6108,They’ll know Sirius left you the place.”
6109,The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous
6110,mood inside number twelve. They had not heard a word from any-
6111,"one beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley’s Patronus, and the"
6112,"strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed"
6113,an annoying habit of playing with the Deluminator in his pocket:
6114,"This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was whiling away the"
6115,wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did
6116,not appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off.
6117,“Will you stop it!” she cried on the third evening of Kreacher’s
6118,"absence, as all light was sucked from the drawing room yet again."
6119,"“Sorry, sorry!” said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring"
6120,the lights. “I don’t know I’m doing it!”
6121,"“Well, can’t you find something useful to occupy yourself?”"
6122,"“What, like reading kids’ stories?”"
6123,"“Dumbledore left me this book, Ron —”"
6124,"“— and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I’m supposed to"
6125,use it!”
6126,"Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room"
6127,unnoticed by either of them. He headed downstairs toward the
6128,"kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where"
6129, 202   
6130,THE BRIBE
6131,Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of
6132,"stairs into the hall, however, he heard a tap on the front door, then"
6133,metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain.
6134,Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten: He pulled out his
6135,"wand, moved into the shadows beside the decapitated elf heads, and"
6136,waited. The door opened: He saw a glimpse of the lamplit square
6137,"outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the"
6138,"door behind it. The intruder took a step forward, and Moody’s voice"
6139,"asked, “Severus Snape?” Then the dust figure rose from the end of"
6140,"the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand."
6141,"“It was not I who killed you, Albus,” said a quiet voice."
6142,"The jinx broke: The dust-figure exploded again, and it was im-"
6143,possible to make out the newcomer through the dense gray cloud
6144,it left behind.
6145,Harry pointed his wand into the middle of it.
6146,“Don’t move!”
6147,He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black: At the sound of his
6148,"yell, the curtains hiding her flew open and she began to scream,"
6149,“Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house —”
6150,"Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry,"
6151,"wands pointing, like his, at the unknown man now standing with"
6152,his arms raised in the hall below.
6153,"“Hold your fire, it’s me, Remus!”"
6154,"“Oh, thank goodness,” said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand"
6155,"at Mrs. Black instead; with a bang, the curtains swished shut again"
6156,"and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did not."
6157,“Show yourself!” he called back.
6158,"Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high"
6159,in a gesture of surrender.

6162,"“I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony,"
6163,"one of the four creators of the Marauder’s Map, married to Nympha-"
6164,"dora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to produce a"
6165,"Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.”"
6166,"“Oh, all right,” said Harry, lowering his wand, “but I had to"
6167,"check, didn’t I?”"
6168,"“Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I"
6169,"quite agree that you had to check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn’t"
6170,be quite so quick to lower your defenses.”
6171,They ran down the stairs toward him. Wrapped in a thick black
6172,"traveling cloak, he looked exhausted, but pleased to see them."
6173,"“No sign of Severus, then?” he asked."
6174,"“No,” said Harry. “What’s going on? Is everyone okay?”"
6175,"“Yes,” said Lupin, “but we’re all being watched. There are a couple"
6176,of Death Eaters in the square outside —”
6177,“We know —”
6178,“I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the
6179,front door to be sure that they would not see me. They can’t know
6180,you’re in here or I’m sure they’d have more people out there; they’re
6181,"staking out everywhere that’s got any connection with you, Harry."
6182,"Let’s go downstairs, there’s a lot to tell you, and I want to know"
6183,what happened after you left the Burrow.”
6184,"They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her"
6185,wand at the grate. A fire sprang up instantly: It gave the illusion of
6186,coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long wooden
6187,table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling
6188,cloak and they sat down.
6189,“I’d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the

6192,"Death Eater tailing me,” said Lupin. “So, you came straight here"
6193,after the wedding?”
6194,"“No,” said Harry, “only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters"
6195,in a café on Tottenham Court Road.”
6196,Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front.
6197,“What?”
6198,"They explained what had happened; when they had finished,"
6199,Lupin looked aghast.
6200,“But how did they find you so quickly? It’s impossible to track
6201,"anyone who Apparates, unless you grab hold of them as they"
6202,disappear!”
6203,“And it doesn’t seem likely they were just strolling down Totten-
6204,"ham Court Road at the time, does it?” said Harry."
6205,"“We wondered,” said Hermione tentatively, “whether Harry could"
6206,still have the Trace on him?”
6207,"“Impossible,” said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely"
6208,"relieved. “Apart from anything else, they’d know for sure Harry was"
6209,"here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn’t they? But I can’t see"
6210,"how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that’s"
6211,"worrying, really worrying.”"
6212,"He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that"
6213,question could wait.
6214,"“Tell us what happened after we left, we haven’t heard a thing"
6215,since Ron’s dad told us the family were safe.”
6216,"“Well, Kingsley saved us,” said Lupin. “Thanks to his warning most"
6217,of the wedding guests were able to Disapparate before they arrived.”
6218,“Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?” interjected
6219,Hermione.

6222,“A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they’re the same thing
6223,"now,” said Lupin. “There were about a dozen of them, but they didn’t"
6224,"know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that they tried"
6225,to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed
6226,"him; if it’s true, he didn’t give you away.”"
6227,Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected
6228,the mingled shock and gratitude he felt. He had never liked Scrim-
6229,"geour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man’s final act"
6230,had been to try to protect Harry.
6231,"“The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,” Lu-"
6232,"pin went on. “They found the ghoul, but didn’t want to get too close"
6233,— and then they interrogated those of us who remained for hours.
6234,"They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course"
6235,nobody apart from the Order knew that you had been there.
6236,"“At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more"
6237,Death Eaters were forcing their way into every Order-connected
6238,"house in the country. No deaths,” he added quickly, forestalling"
6239,"the question, “but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus"
6240,"Diggle’s house, but as you know he wasn’t there, and they used the"
6241,"Cruciatus Curse on Tonks’s family. Again, trying to find out where"
6242,"you went after you visited them. They’re all right — shaken, obvi-"
6243,"ously, but otherwise okay.”"
6244,“The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?”
6245,"Harry asked, remembering how effective these had been on the"
6246,night he had crashed in Tonks’s parents’ garden.
6247,"“What you’ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have"
6248,"got the full might of the Ministry on their side now,” said Lupin."
6249,“They’ve got the power to perform brutal spells without fear of

6252,identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive
6253,"spell we’d cast against them, and once inside, they were completely"
6254,open about why they’d come.”
6255,“And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry’s
6256,"whereabouts out of people?” asked Hermione, an edge to her voice."
6257,"“Well,” said Lupin. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy"
6258,of the Daily Prophet.
6259,"“Here,” he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, “you’ll know"
6260,sooner or later anyway. That’s their pretext for going after you.”
6261,Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own
6262,face filled the front page. He read the headline over it:
6263,WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT
6264,THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
6265,"Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said noth-"
6266,ing. He pushed the newspaper away; he did not want to read any
6267,more: He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had been
6268,on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really
6269,"killed him and, as Rita Skeeter had already told the Wizarding"
6270,"world, Harry had been seen running from the place moments after"
6271,Dumbledore had fallen.
6272,"“I’m sorry, Harry,” Lupin said."
6273,“So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?” asked
6274,Hermione furiously.
6275,Lupin nodded.
6276,“But surely people realize what’s going on?”

6283,“Why didn’t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?”
6284,asked Ron.
6285,Lupin laughed.
6286,"“He doesn’t need to, Ron. Effectively he is the Minister, but why"
6287,"should he sit behind a desk at the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse,"
6288,"is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free to extend"
6289,his power beyond the Ministry.
6290,“Naturally many people have deduced what has happened: There
6291,has been such a dramatic change in Ministry policy in the last few
6292,"days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be behind it."
6293,"However, that is the point: They whisper. They daren’t confide in"
6294,"each other, not knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak"
6295,"out, in case their suspicions are true and their families are targeted."
6296,"Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself"
6297,might have provoked open rebellion: Remaining masked has cre-
6298,"ated confusion, uncertainty, and fear.”"
6299,"“And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,” said Harry, “involves"
6300,warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort?”
6301,"“That’s certainly part of it,” said Lupin, “and it is a masterstroke."
6302,"Now that Dumbledore is dead, you — the Boy Who Lived — were"
6303,sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance to Volde-

6315,"“ ‘Muggle-born Register,’ ” she read aloud. “ ‘The Ministry of Magic"

6318,“ ‘Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals
6319,that magic can only be passed from person to person when Wizards

6330,“But how are they supposed to have ‘stolen’ magic?” said Ron.
6331,"“It’s mental, if you could steal magic there wouldn’t be any Squibs,"
6332,would there?”
6333,"“I know,” said Lupin. “Nevertheless, unless you can prove that"
6334,"you have at least one close Wizarding relative, you are now deemed"
6335,to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the

6359,"way of weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given"
6360,Blood Status — meaning that they have proven to the Ministry that
6361,they are of Wizard descent — before they are allowed to attend.”
6362,"Harry felt sickened and angry: At this moment, excited eleven-"
6363,year-olds would be poring over stacks of newly purchased spell-
6364,"books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps never"
6365,see their families again either.
6366,"“It’s . . . it’s . . .” he muttered, struggling to find words that did"
6367,"justice to the horror of his thoughts, but Lupin said quietly,"
6368,“I know.”
6369,Lupin hesitated.

6371,THE BRIBE
6372,"“I’ll understand if you can’t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is"
6373,under the impression that Dumbledore left you a mission.”
6374,"“He did,” Harry replied, “and Ron and Hermione are in on it"
6375,and they’re coming with me.”
6376,“Can you confide in me what the mission is?”
6377,"Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but"
6378,"graying hair, and wished that he could return a different answer."
6379,"“I can’t, Remus, I’m sorry. If Dumbledore didn’t tell you I don’t"
6380,think I can.”
6381,"“I thought you’d say that,” said Lupin, looking disappointed. “But"
6382,I might still be of some use to you. You know what I am and what I
6383,can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There would
6384,be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.”
6385,"Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they"
6386,would be able to keep their mission secret from Lupin if he were
6387,with them all the time he could not imagine.
6388,"Hermione, however, looked puzzled."
6389,“But what about Tonks?” she asked.
6390,“What about her?” said Lupin.
6391,"“Well,” said Hermione, frowning, “you’re married! How does she"
6392,feel about you going away with us?”
6393,"“Tonks will be perfectly safe,” said Lupin. “She’ll be at her par-"
6394,ents’ house.”
6395,There was something strange in Lupin’s tone; it was almost cold.
6396,There was also something odd in the idea of Tonks remaining hid-
6397,"den at her parents’ house; she was, after all, a member of the Order"
6398,"and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of"
6399,the action.

6401,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6402,"“Remus,” said Hermione tentatively, “is everything all right . . ."
6403,you know . . . between you and —”
6404,"“Everything is fine, thank you,” said Lupin pointedly."
6405,"Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward"
6406,"and embarrassed one, and then Lupin said, with an air of forcing"
6407,"himself to admit something unpleasant, “Tonks is going to have a"
6408,baby.”
6409,"“Oh, how wonderful!” squealed Hermione."
6410,“Excellent!” said Ron enthusiastically.
6411,"“Congratulations,” said Harry."
6412,"Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then"
6413,"said, “So . . . do you accept my offer? Will three become four? I"
6414,"cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he ap-"
6415,"pointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all."
6416,And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of
6417,us have never encountered or imagined.”
6418,Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry.
6419,"“Just — just to be clear,” he said. “You want to leave Tonks at her"
6420,parents’ house and come away with us?”
6421,"“She’ll be perfectly safe there, they’ll look after her,” said Lupin."
6422,"He spoke with a finality bordering on indifference. “Harry, I’m sure"
6423,James would have wanted me to stick with you.”
6424,"“Well,” said Harry slowly, “I’m not. I’m pretty sure my father"
6425,would have wanted to know why you aren’t sticking with your own
6426,"kid, actually.”"
6427,Lupin’s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen
6428,might have dropped ten degrees. Ron stared around the room as
6429,"though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione’s eyes"
6430,swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin.

6433,"“You don’t understand,” said Lupin at last."
6434,"“Explain, then,” said Harry."
6435,Lupin swallowed.
6436,“I — I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against
6437,my better judgment and I have regretted it very much ever since.”
6438,"“I see,” said Harry, “so you’re just going to dump her and the kid"
6439,and run off with us?”
6440,"Lupin sprang to his feet: His chair toppled over backward, and"
6441,"he glared at them so fiercely that Harry saw, for the first time ever,"
6442,the shadow of the wolf upon his human face.
6443,“Don’t you understand what I’ve done to my wife and my unborn
6444,"child? I should never have married her, I’ve made her an outcast!”"
6445,Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned.
6446,"“You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dum-"
6447,bledore’s protection at Hogwarts! You don’t know how most of the
6448,Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they know of my
6449,"affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don’t you see what I’ve done?"
6450,"Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents"
6451,want their only daughter to marry a werewolf? And the child — the
6452,child —”
6453,Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite
6454,deranged.
6455,"“My kind don’t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced"
6456,"of it — how can I forgive myself, when I knowingly risked passing"
6457,"on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by some miracle,"
6458,"it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, with-"
6459,out a father of whom it must always be ashamed!”
6460,"“Remus!” whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. “Don’t say"
6461,that — how could any child be ashamed of you?”
6462, 213   
6463,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6464,"“Oh, I don’t know, Hermione,” said Harry. “I’d be pretty ashamed"
6465,of him.”
6466,"Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had"
6467,propelled him to his feet too. Lupin looked as though Harry had
6468,hit him.
6469,"“If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,” Harry said,"
6470,“what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father’s in the Order?
6471,"My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and you reckon"
6472,he’d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?”
6473,“How — how dare you?” said Lupin. “This is not about a desire
6474,for — for danger or personal glory — how dare you suggest such
6475,a —”
6476,"“I think you’re feeling a bit of a daredevil,” Harry said. “You fancy"
6477,stepping into Sirius’s shoes —”
6478,"“Harry, no!” Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare"
6479,into Lupin’s livid face.
6480,"“I’d never have believed this,” Harry said. “The man who taught"
6481,me to fight dementors — a coward.”
6482,Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for
6483,his own; there was a loud bang and he felt himself flying backward
6484,as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to the
6485,"floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin’s cloak disappearing around"
6486,the door.
6487,"“Remus, Remus, come back!” Hermione cried, but Lupin did not"
6488,respond. A moment later they heard the front door slam.
6489,“Harry!” wailed Hermione. “How could you?”
6490,"“It was easy,” said Harry. He stood up; he could feel a lump swell-"
6491,ing where his head had hit the wall. He was still so full of anger he
6492,was shaking.
6493, 214   
6494,THE BRIBE
6495,“Don’t look at me like that!” he snapped at Hermione.
6496,“Don’t you start on her!” snarled Ron.
6497,"“No — no — we mustn’t fight!” said Hermione, launching her-"
6498,self between them.
6499,"“You shouldn’t have said that stuff to Lupin,” Ron told Harry."
6500,"“He had it coming to him,” said Harry. Broken images were rac-"
6501,ing each other through his mind: Sirius falling through the veil;
6502,"Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light"
6503,"and his mother’s voice, begging for mercy . . ."
6504,"“Parents,” said Harry, “shouldn’t leave their kids unless — unless"
6505,they’ve got to.”
6506,"“Harry —” said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but"
6507,"he shrugged it off and walked away, his eyes on the fire Hermione"
6508,"had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that fireplace,"
6509,"seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him."
6510,Now Lupin’s tortured white face seemed to swim in the air before
6511,him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron nor Hermi-
6512,"one spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other"
6513,"behind his back, communicating silently."
6514,He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away from
6515,each other.
6516,“I know I shouldn’t have called him a coward.”
6517,"“No, you shouldn’t,” said Ron at once."
6518,“But he’s acting like one.”
6519,“All the same . . .” said Hermione.
6520,"“I know,” said Harry. “But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it’ll"
6521,"be worth it, won’t it?”"
6522,He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked
6523,"sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry looked down at his feet, thinking"
6524, 215  
6525,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6526,of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had said
6527,"to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated"
6528,his old friend?
6529,The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent
6530,scene and with Ron and Hermione’s unspoken reproaches. The Daily
6531,"Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the table, Harry’s own"
6532,face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over
6533,"to it and sat down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to"
6534,read. He could not take in the words; his mind was still too full
6535,of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione
6536,had resumed their silent communications on the other side of the
6537,"Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and Dumbledore’s name leapt out"
6538,at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the
6539,"photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph"
6540,"were the words: The Dumbledore family, left to right: Albus; Percival,"
6541,holding newborn Ariana; Kendra; and Aberforth.
6542,"His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more care-"
6543,"fully. Dumbledore’s father, Percival, was a good-looking man with"
6544,eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The
6545,"baby, Ariana, was little longer than a loaf of bread and no more"
6546,"distinctive-looking. The mother, Kendra, had jet-black hair pulled"
6547,into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry
6548,thought of photos of Native Americans he’d seen as he studied her
6549,"dark eyes, high cheekbones, and straight nose, formally composed"
6550,above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore matching
6551,"lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles."
6552,"Albus looked several years older, but otherwise the two boys looked"
6553,"very alike, for this was before Albus’s nose had been broken and"
6554,before he started wearing glasses.
6555,  216 
6556,THE BRIBE
6557,"The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up"
6558,out of the newspaper. Baby Ariana’s arm waved vaguely out of her
6559,shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the headline:
6560,EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM THE UPCOMING
6561,BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
6562,by Rita Skeeter
6563,Thinking that it could hardly make him feel any worse than he
6564,"already did, Harry began to read:"
6565,"Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not"
6566,bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold after her hus-
6567,band Percival’s well-publicized arrest and imprison-
6568,ment in Azkaban. She therefore decided to uproot
6569,"the family and relocate to Godric’s Hollow, the vil-"
6570,lage that was later to gain fame as the scene of Harry
6571,Potter’s strange escape from You-Know-Who.
6572,"Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric’s Hollow was"
6573,"home to a number of Wizarding families, but as"
6574,"Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared"
6575,the curiosity about her husband’s crime she had
6576,faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing
6577,the friendly advances of her new Wizarding neigh-
6578,"bors, she soon ensured that her family was left well"
6579,alone.
6580,“Slammed the door in my face when I went
6581,around to welcome her with a batch of homemade
6582,"Cauldron Cakes,” says Bathilda Bagshot. “The first"

6585,year they were there I only ever saw the two boys.
6586,Wouldn’t have known there was a daughter if I
6587,hadn’t been picking Plangentines by moonlight the
6588,"winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading"
6589,Ariana out into the back garden. Walked her round
6590,"the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took"
6591,her back inside. Didn’t know what to make of it.”
6592,It seems that Kendra thought the move to God-
6593,ric’s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to hide
6594,"Ariana once and for all, something she had probably"
6595,been planning for years. The timing was significant.
6596,Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished
6597,"from sight, and seven is the age by which most ex-"
6598,"perts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if"
6599,present. Nobody now alive remembers Ariana ever
6600,demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical
6601,"ability. It seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made"
6602,a decision to hide her daughter’s existence rather
6603,than suffer the shame of admitting that she had pro-
6604,duced a Squib. Moving away from the friends and
6605,"neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make"
6606,imprisoning her all the easier. The tiny number of
6607,people who henceforth knew of Ariana’s existence
6608,"could be counted upon to keep the secret, including"
6609,"her two brothers, who deflected awkward questions"
6610,with the answer their mother had taught them: “My
6611,sister is too frail for school.”

6614, 218  
6615,THE BRIBE
6616,Harry had been wrong: What he had read had indeed made him
6617,feel worse. He looked back at the photograph of the apparently
6618,happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to
6619,"go to Godric’s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk"
6620,to him; he wanted to visit the place where he and Dumbledore had
6621,both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the newspa-
6622,"per, to ask Ron’s and Hermione’s opinions, when a deafening crack"
6623,echoed around the kitchen.
6624,For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about
6625,Kreacher. His immediate thought was that Lupin had burst back
6626,"into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass"
6627,of struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside
6628,his chair. He hurried to his feet as Kreacher disentangled himself
6629,"and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, “Kreacher has returned with"
6630,"the thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.”"
6631,"Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione,"
6632,"however, was too quick for him."
6633,“Expelliarmus!”
6634,"Mundungus’s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it."
6635,"Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived for the stairs: Ron rugby-tackled him"
6636,and Mundungus hit the stone floor with a muffled crunch.
6637,"“What?” he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself"
6638,from Ron’s grip. “Wha’ve I done? Setting a bleedin’ ’ouse-elf on
6639,"me, what are you playing at, wha’ve I done, lemme go, lemme go,"
6640,or —”
6641,"“You’re not in much of a position to make threats,” said Harry. He"
6642,"threw aside the newspaper, crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and"
6643,"dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped struggling"
6644,"and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry"
6645, 219   
6646,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6647,pointed his wand deliberately at Mundungus’s nose. Mundungus
6648,stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke: His hair was matted and
6649,his robes stained.
6650,"“Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,”"
6651,"croaked the elf. “Fletcher knows how to avoid capture, has many"
6652,"hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher cornered the"
6653,thief in the end.”
6654,"“You’ve done really well, Kreacher,” said Harry, and the elf bowed"
6655,low.
6656,"“Right, we’ve got a few questions for you,” Harry told Mundun-"
6657,"gus, who shouted at once,"
6658,"“I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense,"
6659,"mate, but I never volunteered to die for you, an’ that was bleedin’"
6660,"You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta there,"

6662,"“For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,” said"
6663,Hermione.
6664,"“Well, you’re a bunch of bleedin’ ’eroes then, aren’t you, but I"
6665,never pretended I was up for killing meself —”
6666,"“We’re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,” said"
6667,"Harry, moving his wand a little closer to Mundungus’s baggy,"
6668,bloodshot eyes. “We already knew you were an unreliable bit of
6669,scum.”
6670,"“Well then, why the ’ell am I being ’unted down by ’ouse-elves?"
6671,"Or is this about them goblets again? I ain’t got none of ’em left, or"
6672,you could ’ave ’em —”
6673,"“It’s not about the goblets either, although you’re getting warmer,”"
6674,said Harry. “Shut up and listen.”
6675,"It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he"
6676, 220   
6677,THE BRIBE
6678,could demand some small portion of truth. Harry’s wand was now
6679,so close to the bridge of Mundungus’s nose that Mundungus had
6680,gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view.
6681,"“When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,” Harry"
6682,"began, but Mundungus interrupted him again."
6683,“Sirius never cared about any of the junk —”
6684,"There was the sound of pattering feet, a blaze of shining copper,"
6685,"an echoing clang, and a shriek of agony: Kreacher had taken a run"
6686,at Mundungus and hit him over the head with a saucepan.
6687,"“Call ’im off, call ’im off, ’e should be locked up!” screamed"
6688,"Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher raised the heavy-bottomed pan"
6689,again.
6690,"“Kreacher, no!” shouted Harry."
6691,"Kreacher’s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still"
6692,held aloft.
6693,"“Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?”"
6694,Ron laughed.
6695,"“We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading"
6696,"you can do the honors,” said Harry."
6697,"“Thank you very much, Master,” said Kreacher with a bow, and"
6698,"he retreated a short distance, his great pale eyes still fixed upon"
6699,Mundungus with loathing.
6700,“When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could
6701,"find,” Harry began again, “you took a bunch of stuff from the"
6702,kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.” Harry’s mouth was
6703,suddenly dry: He could sense Ron and Hermione’s tension and ex-
6704,citement too. “What did you do with it?”
6705,“Why?” asked Mundungus. “Is it valuable?”
6706,“You’ve still got it!” cried Hermione.
6707, 221 
6708,CHAPTER ELEVEN
6709,"“No, he hasn’t,” said Ron shrewdly. “He’s wondering whether he"
6710,should have asked more money for it.”
6711,“More?” said Mundungus. “That wouldn’t have been effing dif-
6712,"ficult . . . bleedin’ gave it away, di’n’ I? No choice.”"
6713,“What do you mean?”
6714,“I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if
6715,I’ve got a license for trading in magical artifacts. Bleedin’ snoop. She
6716,"was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an’ told me"
6717,"she’d take it and let me off that time, and to fink meself lucky.”"
6718,“Who was this woman?” asked Harry.
6719,"“I dunno, some Ministry hag.”"
6720,"Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled."
6721,“Little woman. Bow on top of ’er head.”
6722,"He frowned and then added, “Looked like a toad.”"
6723,Harry dropped his wand: It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot
6724,"red sparks into his eyebrows, which ignited."
6725,"“Aguamenti !” screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed"
6726,"from her wand, engulfing a spluttering and choking Mundungus."
6727,Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron’s and
6728,Hermione’s faces. The scars on the back of his right hand seemed to
6729,be tingling again.

6733,"A        s August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the"
6734,middle of Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it
6735,was brittle and brown. The inhabitants of number twelve were never
6736,"seen by anybody in the surrounding houses, and nor was number"
6737,twelve itself. The Muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long
6738,since accepted the amusing mistake in the numbering that had
6739,caused number eleven to sit beside number thirteen.
6740,And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who
6741,seemed to find the anomaly most intriguing. Barely a day passed
6742,without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with no
6743,"other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings"
6744,"facing numbers eleven and thirteen, watching the join between the"
6745,"two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days running,"
6746,although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing.
6747,Most of the Londoners who passed them were used to eccentric
6748,"dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of them"
6749,  223 
6750,CHAPTER TWELVE
6751,"might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear such long"
6752,cloaks in this heat.
6753,The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their
6754,"vigil. Occasionally one of them started forward excitedly, as if they"
6755,"had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back looking"
6756,disappointed.
6757,On the first day of September there were more people lurking in
6758,the square than ever before. Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood
6759,"silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and thirteen,"
6760,but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As
6761,"evening drew in, bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain"
6762,"for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of those inexplicable"
6763,moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting.
6764,"The man with the twisted face pointed and his closest companion,"
6765,"a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a moment later they had"
6766,"relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and"
6767,disappointed.
6768,"Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the"
6769,hall. He had nearly lost his balance as he Apparated onto the top
6770,"step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death Eaters"
6771,might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow.
6772,"Shutting the front door carefully behind him, he pulled off the"
6773,"Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along the"
6774,"gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen"
6775,copy of the Daily Prophet clutched in his hand.
6776,"The usual low whisper of “Severus Snape?” greeted him, the chill"
6777,"wind swept him, and his tongue rolled up for a moment."
6778,"“I didn’t kill you,” he said, once it had unrolled, then held his"
6779,breath as the dusty jinx-figure exploded. He waited until he was
6780,  224  
6781,MAGIC IS MIGHT
6782,"halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. Black"
6783,"and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, “I’ve got news, and you"
6784,won’t like it.”
6785,The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now
6786,shone: Copper pots and pans had been burnished to a rosy glow;
6787,the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates already laid for
6788,"dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a"
6789,"cauldron was simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more"
6790,dramatically different than the house-elf who now came hurrying
6791,"toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean"
6792,"and fluffy as cotton wool, Regulus’s locket bouncing on his thin"
6793,chest.
6794,"“Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed be-"
6795,"fore dinner,” croaked Kreacher, seizing the Invisibility Cloak and"
6796,"slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number of"
6797,old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered.
6798,“What’s happened?” Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermi-
6799,one had been poring over a sheaf of scribbled notes and hand-drawn
6800,"maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now they"
6801,watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the news-
6802,paper on top of their scattered parchment.
6803,"A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared"
6804,"up at them all, beneath a headline that read:"
6805,SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER
6806,“No!” said Ron and Hermione loudly.
6807,Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and be-
6808,gan to read the accompanying story out loud.
6809,  225  
6810,CHAPTER TWELVE
6811,"“ ‘Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of"
6812,"Witchcraft and Wizardry, was today appointed headmaster in the most"
6813,important of several staffing changes at the ancient school. Following
6814,"the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow"
6815,"will take over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of"
6816,Defense Against the Dark Arts professor.
6817,“ ‘I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding tradi-
6818,tions and values —’ Like committing murder and cutting off peo-
6819,"ple’s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in Dumbledore’s"
6820,"study — Merlin’s pants!” she shrieked, making both Harry and"
6821,"Ron jump. She leapt up from the table and hurtled from the room,"
6822,"shouting as she went, “I’ll be back in a minute!”"
6823,"“ ‘Merlin’s pants’?” repeated Ron, looking amused. “She must"
6824,be upset.” He pulled the newspaper toward him and perused the
6825,article about Snape.
6826,“The other teachers won’t stand for this. McGonagall and Flit-
6827,"wick and Sprout all know the truth, they know how Dumbledore"
6828,died. They won’t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are these
6829,Carrows?”
6830,"“Death Eaters,” said Harry. “There are pictures of them inside."
6831,"They were at the top of the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore,"
6832,"so it’s all friends together. And,” Harry went on bitterly, drawing"
6833,"up a chair, “I can’t see that the other teachers have got any choice"
6834,but to stay. If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it’ll be
6835,"a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice few years in Az-"
6836,kaban — and that’s if they’re lucky. I reckon they’ll stay to try and
6837,protect the students.”
6838,Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his
6839, 226   
6840,MAGIC IS MIGHT
6841,"hands, and ladled out soup into pristine bowls, whistling between"
6842,his teeth as he did so.
6843,"“Thanks, Kreacher,” said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as"
6844,"not to have to look at Snape’s face. “Well, at least we know exactly"
6845,where Snape is now.”
6846,He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher’s
6847,cooking had improved dramatically ever since he had been given
6848,Regulus’s locket: Today’s French onion was as good as Harry had
6849,ever tasted.
6850,"“There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house,” he"
6851,"told Ron as he ate, “more than usual. It’s like they’re hoping we’ll"
6852,march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hog-
6853,warts Express.”
6854,Ron glanced at his watch.
6855,“I’ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago.
6856,"Weird, not being on it, isn’t it?”"
6857,In his mind’s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as
6858,"he and Ron had once followed it by air, shimmering between fields"
6859,"and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure Ginny, Neville,"
6860,"and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wonder-"
6861,"ing where he, Ron, and Hermione were, or debating how best to"
6862,undermine Snape’s new regime.
6863,"“They nearly saw me coming back in just now,” Harry said. “I"
6864,"landed badly on the top step, and the Cloak slipped.”"
6865,"“I do that every time. Oh, here she is,” Ron added, craning around"
6866,in his seat to watch Hermione reentering the kitchen. “And what in
6867,the name of Merlin’s most baggy Y Fronts was that about?”
6868,"“I remembered this,” Hermione panted."
6869, 227   
6870,CHAPTER TWELVE
6871,"She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered"
6872,"to the floor before seizing her small, beaded bag from the kitchen"
6873,"sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting inside,"
6874,and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the
6875,"tiny bag, within a few seconds it had vanished, like so much else,"
6876,into the bag’s capacious depths.
6877,"“Phineas Nigellus,” Hermione explained as she threw the bag"
6878,"onto the kitchen table with the usual sonorous, clanking crash."
6879,"“Sorry?” said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image"
6880,of Phineas Nigellus Black was able to flit between his portrait in
6881,Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster’s office
6882,at Hogwarts: the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt
6883,"sitting right now, in triumphant possession of Dumbledore’s collec-"
6884,"tion of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone Pensieve, the"
6885,"Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of"
6886,Gryffindor.
6887,“Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for
6888,"him,” Hermione explained to Ron as she resumed her seat. “But let"
6889,"him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the inside"
6890,of my handbag.”
6891,"“Good thinking!” said Ron, looking impressed."
6892,"“Thank you,” smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her."
6893,"“So, Harry, what else happened today?”"
6894,"“Nothing,” said Harry. “Watched the Ministry entrance for seven"
6895,"hours. No sign of her. Saw your dad, though, Ron. He looks fine.”"
6896,Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that
6897,it was far too dangerous to try and communicate with Mr. Weasley
6898,"while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was always"
6899,"surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring"
6900, 228  
6901,MAGIC IS MIGHT
6902,"to catch these glimpses of him, even if he did look very strained"
6903,and anxious.
6904,“Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network
6905,"to get to work,” Ron said. “That’s why we haven’t seen Umbridge,"
6906,"she’d never walk, she’d think she’s too important.”"
6907,“And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in
6908,the navy robes?” Hermione asked.
6909,"“Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,” said Ron."
6910,“How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?” Hermi-
6911,"one asked, her soupspoon suspended in midair."
6912,“Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue
6913,robes.”
6914,“But you never told us that!”
6915,Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of
6916,notes and maps that she and Ron had been examining when Harry
6917,had entered the kitchen.
6918,"“There’s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!” she"
6919,"said, flipping feverishly through the pages."
6920,"“Well, does it really matter?”"
6921,"“Ron, it all matters! If we’re going to get into the Ministry and"
6922,not give ourselves away when they’re bound to be on the lookout for
6923,"intruders, every little detail matters! We’ve been over and over this, I"
6924,"mean, what’s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren’t"
6925,even bothering to tell us —”
6926,"“Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing —”"
6927,"“You do realize, don’t you, that there’s probably no more dan-"
6928,gerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the
6929,Ministry of —”
6930,"“I think we should do it tomorrow,” said Harry."
6931,  229  
6932,CHAPTER TWELVE
6933,"Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little"
6934,over his soup.
6935,"“Tomorrow?” repeated Hermione. “You aren’t serious, Harry?”"
6936,"“I am,” said Harry. “I don’t think we’re going to be much better"
6937,prepared than we are now even if we skulk around the Ministry
6938,"entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther"
6939,away that locket could be. There’s already a good chance Umbridge
6940,has chucked it away; the thing doesn’t open.”
6941,"“Unless,” said Ron, “she’s found a way of opening it and she’s"
6942,now possessed.”
6943,"“Wouldn’t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first"
6944,"place,” Harry shrugged."
6945,"Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought."
6946,"“We know everything important,” Harry went on, addressing"
6947,Hermione. “We know they’ve stopped Apparition in and out of the
6948,Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members are al-
6949,"lowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because"
6950,Ron heard those two Unspeakables complaining about it. And we
6951,"know roughly where Umbridge’s office is, because of what you heard"
6952,that bearded bloke saying to his mate —”
6953,"“ ‘I’ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,’ ” Hermione re-"
6954,cited immediately.
6955,"“Exactly,” said Harry. “And we know you get in using those funny"
6956,"coins, or tokens, or whatever they are, because I saw that witch bor-"
6957,rowing one from her friend —”
6958,“But we haven’t got any!”
6959,"“If the plan works, we will have,” Harry continued calmly."
6960,"“I don’t know, Harry, I don’t know. . . . There are an awful lot of"
6961,"things that could go wrong, so much relies on chance. . . .”"
6962,  230  
6963,MAGIC IS MIGHT
6964,“That’ll be true even if we spend another three months prepar-
6965,"ing,” said Harry. “It’s time to act.”"
6966,He could tell from Ron’s and Hermione’s faces that they were
6967,"scared; he was not particularly confident himself, and yet he was"
6968,sure the time had come to put their plan into operation.
6969,They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don
6970,the Invisibility Cloak and spy on the official entrance to the Minis-
6971,"try, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since childhood."
6972,"They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on"
6973,"their conversations, and learned by careful observation which of"
6974,"them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the same time every"
6975,day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet
6976,out of somebody’s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy
6977,maps and notes now stacked in front of Hermione.
6978,"“All right,” said Ron slowly, “let’s say we go for it tomorrow. . . ."
6979,I think it should just be me and Harry.”
6980,"“Oh, don’t start that again!” sighed Hermione. “I thought we’d"
6981,settled this.”
6982,"“It’s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak,"
6983,"but this is different, Hermione.” Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of"
6984,the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. “You’re on the list of
6985,Muggle-borns who didn’t present themselves for interrogation!”
6986,“And you’re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow!
6987,"If anyone shouldn’t go, it’s Harry, he’s got a ten-thousand-Galleon"
6988,price on his head —”
6989,"“Fine, I’ll stay here,” said Harry. “Let me know if you ever defeat"
6990,"Voldemort, won’t you?”"
6991,"As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on"
6992,Harry’s forehead. His hand jumped to it: He saw Hermione’s eyes
6993, 231   
6994,CHAPTER TWELVE
6995,"narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing his hair"
6996,out of his eyes.
6997,"“Well, if all three of us go we’ll have to Disapparate separately,”"
6998,Ron was saying. “We can’t all fit under the Cloak anymore.”
6999,Harry’s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up.
7000,"At once, Kreacher hurried forward."
7001,"“Master has not finished his soup, would Master prefer the savory"
7002,"stew, or else the treacle tart to which Master is so partial?”"
7003,"“Thanks, Kreacher, but I’ll be back in a minute — er — bath-"
7004,room.”
7005,"Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hur-"
7006,"ried up the stairs to the hall and then to the first landing, where he"
7007,dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting with
7008,"pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of"
7009,open-mouthed serpents and closed his eyes. . . .
7010,He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side
7011,"of him had high, timbered gables; they looked like gingerbread"
7012,houses.
7013,"He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness of his own"
7014,long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mount-
7015,ing excitement. . . .
7016,The door opened: A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as
7017,"she looked into Harry’s face: humor gone, terror replacing it. . . ."
7018,"“Gregorovitch?” said a high, cold voice."
7019,She shook her head: She was trying to close the door. A white
7020,"hand held it steady, prevented her shutting him out. . . ."
7021,“I want Gregorovitch.”
7022,"“Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!” she cried, shaking her head. “He no"
7023,live here! He no live here! I know him not!”
7024, 232 
7025,MAGIC IS MIGHT
7026,"Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back"
7027,"away down the dark hall, and Harry followed, gliding toward her,"
7028,and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand.
7029,“Where is he?”
7030,"“Das weiß ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!”"
7031,He raised the wand. She screamed. Two young children came
7032,running into the hall. She tried to shield them with her arms. There
7033,was a flash of green light —
7034,“Harry! HARRY!”
7035,He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was
7036,pounding on the door again.
7037,"“Harry, open up!”"
7038,"He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door;"
7039,"Hermione toppled inside at once, regained her balance, and looked"
7040,"around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking unnerved as"
7041,he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.
7042,“What were you doing?” asked Hermione sternly.
7043,“What d’you think I was doing?” asked Harry with feeble
7044,bravado.
7045,“You were yelling your head off!” said Ron.
7046,“Oh yeah . . . I must’ve dozed off or —”
7047,"“Harry, please don’t insult our intelligence,” said Hermione, tak-"
7048,"ing deep breaths. “We know your scar hurt downstairs, and you’re"
7049,white as a sheet.”
7050,Harry sat down on the edge of the bath.
7051,“Fine. I’ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now
7052,he’s probably killed her whole family. And he didn’t need to. It was
7053,"Cedric all over again, they were just there. . . .”"
7054,"“Harry, you aren’t supposed to let this happen anymore!”"
7055, 233  
7056,CHAPTER TWELVE
7057,"Hermione cried, her voice echoing through the bathroom. “Dum-"
7058,bledore wanted you to use Occlumency! He thought the connection
7059,"was dangerous — Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to"
7060,"watch him kill and torture, how can it help?”"
7061,"“Because it means I know what he’s doing,” said Harry."
7062,“So you’re not even going to try to shut him out?”
7063,"“Hermione, I can’t. You know I’m lousy at Occlumency, I never"
7064,got the hang of it.”
7065,"“You never really tried!” she said hotly. “I don’t get it, Harry —"
7066,do you like having this special connection or relationship or
7067,what — whatever —”
7068,She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up.
7069,“Like it?” he said quietly. “Would you like it?”
7070,"“I — no — I’m sorry, Harry, I didn’t mean —”"
7071,"“I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to"
7072,watch him when he’s most dangerous. But I’m going to use it.”
7073,“Dumbledore —”
7074,"“Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else’s. I want to"
7075,know why he’s after Gregorovitch.”
7076,“Who?”
7077,"“He’s a foreign wandmaker,” said Harry. “He made Krum’s wand"
7078,and Krum reckons he’s brilliant.”
7079,"“But according to you,” said Ron, “Voldemort’s got Ollivander"
7080,"locked up somewhere. If he’s already got a wandmaker, what does"
7081,he need another one for?”
7082,"“Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch"
7083,is better . . . or else he thinks Gregorovitch will be able to explain
7084,"what my wand did when he was chasing me, because Ollivander"
7085,didn’t know.”
7086, 234  
7087,MAGIC IS MIGHT
7088,"Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and"
7089,Hermione exchanging skeptical looks behind his back.
7090,"“Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,” said Her-"
7091,"mione, “but you made it happen! Why are you so determined not"
7092,to take responsibility for your own power?”
7093,"“Because I know it wasn’t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione!"
7094,We both know what really happened!”
7095,They glared at each other: Harry knew that he had not con-
7096,"vinced Hermione and that she was marshaling counterarguments,"
7097,against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was per-
7098,"mitting himself to see into Voldemort’s mind. To his relief, Ron"
7099,intervened.
7100,"“Drop it,” he advised her. “It’s up to him. And if we’re going to"
7101,"the Ministry tomorrow, don’t you reckon we should go over the"
7102,plan?”
7103,"Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the mat-"
7104,"ter rest, though Harry was quite sure she would attack again at the"
7105,"first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement"
7106,"kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart."
7107,"They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours"
7108,"going over and over their plan until they could recite it, word per-"
7109,"fect, to each other. Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius’s room, lay"
7110,in bed with his wandlight trained on the old photograph of his fa-
7111,"ther, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself"
7112,"for another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he"
7113,"was thinking not of Polyjuice Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy"
7114,blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he thought of Gregorovitch the
7115,"wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while"
7116,Voldemort sought him so determinedly.
7117, 235   

7119,Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.
7120,"“You look terrible,” was Ron’s greeting as he entered the room"
7121,to wake Harry.
7122,"“Not for long,” said Harry, yawning."
7123,They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being
7124,served coffee and hot rolls by Kreacher and wearing the slightly
7125,manic expression that Harry associated with exam review.
7126,"“Robes,” she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence"
7127,with a nervous nod and continuing to poke around in her beaded
7128,"bag, “Polyjuice Potion . . . Invisibility Cloak . . . Decoy Detonators"
7129,". . . You should each take a couple just in case. . . . Puking Pastilles,"
7130,"Nosebleed Nougat, Extendable Ears . . .”"
7131,"They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher"
7132,bowing them out and promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie
7133,ready for them when they returned.
7134,"“Bless him,” said Ron fondly, “and when you think I used to fan-"
7135,tasize about cutting off his head and sticking it on the wall.”
7136,They made their way onto the front step with immense caution:
7137,They could see a couple of puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the
7138,house from across the misty square.
7139,"Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for"
7140,Harry.
7141,"After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry"
7142,found himself in the tiny alleyway where the first phase of their
7143,"plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, except for"
7144,a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually
7145,appear here until at least eight o’clock.
7146,"“Right then,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “She ought to"
7147,be here in about five minutes. When I’ve Stunned her —”

7151,supposed to open the door before she got here?”
7152,Hermione squealed.
7153,“I nearly forgot! Stand back —”
7154,She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire
7155,"door beside them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor"
7156,"behind it led, as they knew from their careful scouting trips, into an"
7157,"empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make"
7158,it look as though it was still closed.
7159,"“And now,” she said, turning back to face the other two in the"
7160,"alleyway, “we put on the Cloak again —”"
7161,"“— and we wait,” Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione’s head"
7162,like a blanket over a birdcage and rolling his eyes at Harry.
7163,"Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little"
7164,"Ministry witch with flyaway gray hair Apparated feet from them,"
7165,blinking a little in the sudden brightness; the sun had just come out
7166,from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected
7167,"warmth, however, before Hermione’s silent Stunning Spell hit her"
7168,in the chest and she toppled over.
7169,"“Nicely done, Hermione,” said Ron, emerging from behind a"
7170,bin beside the theater door as Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak.
7171,Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that
7172,led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch’s head
7173,and added them to a flask of muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken
7174,from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little witch’s
7175,handbag.
7176,"“She’s Mafalda Hopkirk,” he said, reading a small card that iden-"
7177,tified their victim as an assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Of-
7178,"fice. “You’d better take this, Hermione, and here are the tokens.”"
7179, 237   
7180,CHAPTER TWELVE
7181,"He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the"
7182,"letters M.O.M., which he had taken from the witch’s purse."
7183,"Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant"
7184,"heliotrope color, and within seconds stood before them, the double"
7185,of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda’s spectacles and put
7186,"them on, Harry checked his watch."
7187,"“We’re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any"
7188,second.”
7189,They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda; Harry and
7190,Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak over themselves but Hermione re-
7191,"mained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, and"
7192,"a small, ferrety-looking wizard appeared before them."
7193,"“Oh, hello, Mafalda.”"
7194,“Hello!” said Hermione in a quavery voice. “How are you
7195,today?”
7196,"“Not so good, actually,” replied the little wizard, who looked"
7197,thoroughly downcast.
7198,"As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry"
7199,and Ron crept along behind them.
7200,"“I’m sorry to hear you’re under the weather,” said Hermione,"
7201,talking firmly over the little wizard as he tried to expound upon
7202,his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the street.
7203,"“Here, have a sweet.”"
7204,"“Eh? Oh, no thanks —”"
7205,"“I insist!” said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles"
7206,"in his face. Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one."
7207,The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched
7208,"his tongue, the little wizard started vomiting so hard that he did"
7209, 238  
7210,MAGIC IS MIGHT
7211,not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from the top
7212,of his head.
7213,"“Oh dear!” she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. “Perhaps"
7214,you’d better take the day off!”
7215,"“No — no!” He choked and retched, trying to continue on his"
7216,way despite being unable to walk straight. “I must — today — must
7217,go —”
7218,"“But that’s just silly!” said Hermione, alarmed. “You can’t go to"
7219,work in this state — I think you ought to go to St. Mungo’s and
7220,get them to sort you out!”
7221,"The wizard had collapsed, heaving, onto all fours, still trying to"
7222,crawl toward the main street.
7223,“You simply can’t go to work like this!” cried Hermione.
7224,At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a re-
7225,"pulsed Hermione to claw his way back into a standing position, he"
7226,"turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the"
7227,bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying
7228,chunks of vomit.
7229,"“Urgh,” said Hermione, holding up the skirts of her robe to avoid"
7230,the puddles of sick. “It would have made much less mess to Stun
7231,him too.”
7232,"“Yeah,” said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the"
7233,"wizard’s bag, “but I still think a whole pile of unconscious bodies"
7234,"would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn’t"
7235,"he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.”"
7236,"Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety"
7237,"as the sick wizard, and wearing the navy blue robes that had been"
7238,folded in his bag.
7239, 239 
7240,CHAPTER TWELVE
7241,"“Weird he wasn’t wearing them today, wasn’t it, seeing how much"
7242,"he wanted to go? Anyway, I’m Reg Cattermole, according to the"
7243,label in the back.”
7244,"“Now wait here,” Hermione told Harry, who was still under the"
7245,"Invisibility Cloak, “and we’ll be back with some hairs for you.”"
7246,"He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to"
7247,"Harry, skulking alone in the sick-splattered alleyway beside the"
7248,door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione
7249,reappeared.
7250,"“We don’t know who he is,” Hermione said, passing Harry several"
7251,"curly black hairs, “but he’s gone home with a dreadful nosebleed!"
7252,"Here, he’s pretty tall, you’ll need bigger robes. . . .”"
7253,She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for
7254,"them, and Harry retired to take the potion and change."
7255,Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than
7256,"six feet tall and, from what he could tell from his well-muscled arms,"
7257,powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the Invisibility Cloak
7258,"and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two."
7259,"“Blimey, that’s scary,” said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now"
7260,towered over him.
7261,"“Take one of Mafalda’s tokens,” Hermione told Harry, “and let’s"
7262,"go, it’s nearly nine.”"
7263,They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the
7264,crowded pavement there were spiked black railings flanking two
7265,"flights of steps, one labeled gentlemen, the other ladies."
7266,"“See you in a moment, then,” said Hermione nervously, and she"
7267,tottered off down the steps to ladies. Harry and Ron joined a num-
7268,ber of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to be an or-
7269,"dinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white."
7270, 240  
7271,MAGIC IS MIGHT
7272,"“Morning, Reg!” called another wizard in navy blue robes as he"
7273,let himself into a cubicle by inserting his golden token into a slot
7274,"in the door. “Blooming pain in the bum, this, eh? Forcing us all"
7275,"to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry"
7276,Potter?”
7277,The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced
7278,chuckle.
7279,"“Yeah,” he said, “stupid, isn’t it?”"
7280,And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles.
7281,To Harry’s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched
7282,"down and peered through the gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just"
7283,in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet next door.
7284,He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.
7285,“We have to flush ourselves in?” he whispered.
7286,"“Looks like it,” Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep"
7287,and gravelly.
7288,"They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clam-"
7289,bered into the toilet.
7290,He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he ap-
7291,"peared to be standing in water, his shoes, feet, and robes remained"
7292,"quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment had"
7293,"zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the"
7294,Ministry of Magic.
7295,He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he
7296,was accustomed to. The great Atrium seemed darker than Harry
7297,remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the center of
7298,"the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden"
7299,floor and walls. Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the
7300,"scene. It was rather frightening, this vast sculpture of a witch and"
7301,  241   
7302,CHAPTER TWELVE
7303,"a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the"
7304,Ministry workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved
7305,in foot-high letters at the base of the statue were the words magic
7306,is might.
7307,Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs: Another
7308,wizard had just flown out of the fireplace behind him.
7309,"“Out of the way, can’t y — oh, sorry, Runcorn!”"
7310,"Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Appar-"
7311,"ently the man whom Harry was impersonating, Runcorn, was"
7312,intimidating.
7313,"“Psst!” said a voice, and he looked around to see a wispy little"
7314,witch and the ferrety wizard from Magical Maintenance gesturing
7315,to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join them.
7316,"“You got in all right, then?” Hermione whispered to Harry."
7317,"“No, he’s still stuck in the bog,” said Ron."
7318,"“Oh, very funny . . . It’s horrible, isn’t it?” she said to Harry, who"
7319,was staring up at the statue. “Have you seen what they’re sitting
7320,on?
7321,Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought
7322,were decoratively carved thrones were actually mounds of carved
7323,"humans: hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, women,"
7324,"and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed"
7325,together to support the weight of the handsomely robed wizards.
7326,"“Muggles,” whispered Hermione. “In their rightful place. Come"
7327,"on, let’s get going.”"
7328,They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward
7329,"the golden gates at the end of the hall, looking around as surrepti-"
7330,"tiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of"
7331,Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller
7332, 242    
7333,MAGIC IS MIGHT
7334,"hall, where queues were forming in front of twenty golden grilles"
7335,housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest one when
7336,"a voice said, “Cattermole!”"
7337,They looked around: Harry’s stomach turned over. One of the
7338,Death Eaters who had witnessed Dumbledore’s death was striding
7339,"toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their"
7340,eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The
7341,"man’s scowling, slightly brutish face was somehow at odds with his"
7342,"magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with much"
7343,gold thread. Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophan-
7344,"tically, “Morning, Yaxley!” Yaxley ignored them."
7345,“I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out
7346,"my office, Cattermole. It’s still raining in there.”"
7347,Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would in-
7348,"tervene, but nobody spoke."
7349,"“Raining . . . in your office? That’s — that’s not good, is it?”"
7350,Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley’s eyes widened.
7351,"“You think it’s funny, Cattermole, do you?”"
7352,A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and
7353,bustled off.
7354,"“No,” said Ron, “no, of course —”"
7355,“You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your
7356,"wife, Cattermole? In fact, I’m quite surprised you’re not down there"
7357,holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a bad
7358,"job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next"
7359,time.”
7360,Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at
7361,her. She coughed feebly and turned away.
7362,“I — I —” stammered Ron.
7363,  243   
7364,CHAPTER TWELVE
7365,"“But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,” said Yaxley,"
7366,“— not that any woman I married would ever be mistaken for such
7367,filth — and the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforce-
7368,"ment needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do that"
7369,"job, Cattermole. Do you understand me?”"
7370,"“Yes,” whispered Ron."
7371,"“Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely"
7372,"dry within an hour, your wife’s Blood Status will be in even graver"
7373,doubt than it is now.”
7374,The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and
7375,"unpleasant smile to Harry, who was evidently expected to appreci-"
7376,"ate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward another"
7377,"lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed"
7378,them: It was as if they were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang
7379,and the lift began to move upward.
7380,“What am I going to do?” Ron asked the other two at once; he
7381,"looked stricken. “If I don’t turn up, my wife — I mean, Cattermole’s"
7382,wife —”
7383,"“We’ll come with you, we should stick together —” began"
7384,"Harry, but Ron shook his head feverishly."
7385,"“That’s mental, we haven’t got much time. You two find Um-"
7386,"bridge, I’ll go and sort out Yaxley’s office — but how do I stop it"
7387,raining?”
7388,"“Try Finite Incantatem,” said Hermione at once, “that should stop"
7389,"the rain if it’s a hex or curse; if it doesn’t, something’s gone wrong"
7390,"with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to fix, so"
7391,as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings —”
7392,"“Say it again, slowly —” said Ron, searching his pockets des-"
7393,"perately for a quill, but at that moment the lift juddered to a halt."
7394,  244   
7395,MAGIC IS MIGHT
7396,"A disembodied female voice said, “Level four, Department for the"
7397,"Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast,"
7398,"Being, and Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advi-"
7399,"sory Bureau,” and the grilles slid open again, admitting a couple of"
7400,wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around
7401,the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.
7402,"“Morning, Albert,” said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at"
7403,Harry. He glanced over at Ron and Hermione as the lift creaked
7404,upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic instruc-
7405,"tions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and mut-"
7406,"tered, “Dirk Cresswell, eh? From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert."
7407,I’m pretty confident I’ll get his job now!”
7408,"He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice."
7409,The lift stopped; the grilles opened once more.
7410,"“Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, includ-"
7411,"ing the Improper Use of Magic Office, Auror Headquarters, and"
7412,"Wizengamot Administration Services,” said the disembodied witch’s"
7413,voice.
7414,Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of
7415,"the lift, followed by the other wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione"
7416,"alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione said, very"
7417,"fast, “Actually, Harry, I think I’d better go after him, I don’t think he"
7418,knows what he’s doing and if he gets caught the whole thing —”
7419,"“Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.”"
7420,The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four
7421,"people stood before them, two of them deep in conversation: a long-"
7422,"haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and a"
7423,"squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and"
7424,clutching a clipboard to her chest.

7430,"A        h, Mafalda!” said Umbridge, looking at Hermione. “Trav-"
7431,"ers sent you, did he?”"
7432,"“Y-yes,” squeaked Hermione."
7433,"“Good, you’ll do perfectly well.” Umbridge spoke to the wizard"
7434,"in black and gold. “That’s that problem solved, Minister, if Ma-"
7435,falda can be spared for record-keeping we shall be able to start
7436,straightaway.” She consulted her clipboard. “Ten people today
7437,"and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut . . ."
7438,"even here, in the heart of the Ministry!” She stepped into the lift"
7439,"beside Hermione, as did the two wizards who had been listening"
7440,to Umbridge’s conversation with the Minister. “We’ll go straight
7441,"down, Mafalda, you’ll find everything you need in the courtroom."
7442,"Good morning, Albert, aren’t you getting out?”"
7443,"“Yes, of course,” said Harry in Runcorn’s deep voice."
7444,Harry stepped out of the lift. The golden grilles clanged shut
7445,"behind him. Glancing over his shoulder, Harry saw Hermione’s"
7446, 246 
7447,THE MUGGLE-BORN
7448,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
7449,"anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side of"
7450,"her, Umbridge’s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder."
7451,"“What brings you up here, Runcorn?” asked the new Minister of"
7452,"Magic. His long black hair and beard were streaked with silver, and"
7453,"a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, putting"
7454,Harry in mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock.
7455,"“Needed a quick word with,” Harry hesitated for a fraction of a"
7456,"second, “Arthur Weasley. Someone said he was up on level one.”"
7457,"“Ah,” said Pius Thicknesse. “Has he been caught having contact"
7458,with an Undesirable?”
7459,"“No,” said Harry, his throat dry. “No, nothing like that.”"
7460,"“Ah, well. It’s only a matter of time,” said Thicknesse. “If you"
7461,"ask me, the blood traitors are as bad as the Mudbloods. Good day,"
7462,Runcorn.”
7463,"“Good day, Minister.”"
7464,Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted
7465,"corridor. The moment the Minister had passed out of sight, Harry"
7466,"tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy black cloak,"
7467,"threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite"
7468,direction. Runcorn was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to
7469,make sure his big feet were hidden.
7470,Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming
7471,"wooden door after gleaming wooden door, each bearing a small"
7472,"plaque with the owner’s name and occupation upon it, the might"
7473,"of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force"
7474,itself upon him so that the plan he had been carefully concocting
7475,with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks seemed laughably
7476,childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside
7477,without being detected: They had not given a moment’s thought to
7478, 247   
7479,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7480,what they would do if they were forced to separate. Now Hermi-
7481,"one was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last"
7482,hours; Ron was struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was
7483,"beyond him, a woman’s liberty possibly depending on the outcome;"
7484,"and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he"
7485,knew perfectly well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift.
7486,"He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide"
7487,what to do. The silence pressed upon him: There was no bustling
7488,or talk or swift footsteps here; the purple-carpeted corridors were
7489,as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the
7490,place.
7491,"Her office must be up here, Harry thought."
7492,It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry
7493,"in her office, but on the other hand it seemed foolish not to search"
7494,"it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, pass-"
7495,ing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instruc-
7496,"tions to a quill that floated in front of him, scribbling on a trail of"
7497,parchment.
7498,"Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned"
7499,"a corner. Halfway along the next corridor he emerged into a wide,"
7500,open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at small
7501,"desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished"
7502,"and free from graffiti. Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was"
7503,quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and twiddling their wands
7504,"in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direc-"
7505,"tion like little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that"
7506,"there was a rhythm to the proceedings, that the papers all formed"
7507,the same pattern; and after a few more seconds he realized that what
7508,he was watching was the creation of pamphlets — that the paper
7509, 248  
7510,THE MUGGLE-BORN
7511,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
7512,"squares were pages, which, when assembled, folded, and magicked"
7513,"into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard."
7514,"Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what"
7515,they were doing that he doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled
7516,"footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the pile beside a"
7517,young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink
7518,cover was emblazoned with a golden title:
7519,MUDBLOODS
7520,and the Dangers They Pose to
7521,a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society
7522,Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face
7523,"in the middle of its petals, being strangled by a green weed with"
7524,"fangs and a scowl. There was no author’s name upon the pamphlet,"
7525,"but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle"
7526,as he examined it. Then the young witch beside him confirmed his
7527,"suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her wand, “Will the"
7528,"old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?”"
7529,"“Careful,” said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously;"
7530,one of his pages slipped and fell to the floor.
7531,"“What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?”"
7532,The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the
7533,"space full of pamphlet-makers; Harry looked too, and rage reared"
7534,in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole on
7535,"a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris had"
7536,been set into the wood — an eye that was shockingly familiar to
7537,anybody who had known Alastor Moody.
7538,For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was
7539, 249  
7540,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7541,doing there: He even forgot that he was invisible. He strode straight
7542,over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving: It gazed
7543,"blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read:"
7544,Dolores Umbridge
7545,Senior Undersecretary to the Minister

7549,Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers: Though they
7550,"were intent upon their work, he could hardly suppose that they would"
7551,not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of them. He
7552,therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little
7553,waving legs and a rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down
7554,"beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator on the ground."
7555,It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wiz-
7556,"ards in front of him. A few moments later, during which Harry"
7557,"waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud bang"
7558,and a great deal of acrid black smoke billowed from a corner. The
7559,young witch in the front row shrieked: Pink pages flew everywhere
7560,"as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the source"
7561,"of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Um-"
7562,"bridge’s office, and closed the door behind him."
7563,He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like
7564,"Umbridge’s office at Hogwarts: Lace draperies, doilies, and dried"
7565,flowers covered every available surface. The walls bore the same
7566, 250   

7568,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
7569,"ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, beribboned kit-"
7570,"ten, gamboling and frisking with sickening cuteness. The desk was"
7571,"covered with a flouncy, flowered cloth. Behind Mad-Eye’s eye, a"
7572,telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on
7573,the other side of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw
7574,that they were all still gathered around the Decoy Detonator. He
7575,"wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled"
7576,"the magical eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. Then he"
7577,"turned to face the room again, raised his wand, and murmured,"
7578,“Accio Locket.”
7579,"Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Um-"
7580,bridge knew all about protective charms and spells. He therefore
7581,hurried behind her desk and began pulling open the drawers. He
7582,saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips
7583,that coiled snakelike from their drawer and had to be beaten back;
7584,a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no sign
7585,of a locket.
7586,There was a filing cabinet behind the desk: Harry set to search-
7587,"ing it. Like Filch’s filing cabinets at Hogwarts, it was full of fold-"
7588,"ers, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the"
7589,bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from his
7590,search: Mr. Weasley’s file.
7591,He pulled it out and opened it.

7606,"“Undesirable Number One,” Harry muttered under his breath"
7607,as he replaced Mr. Weasley’s folder and shut the drawer. He had an
7608,"idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he straightened"
7609,"up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places, he saw a"
7610,"poster of himself on the wall, with the words undesirable no. 1"
7611,emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note was stuck to it with a
7612,picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and
7613,"saw that Umbridge had written, “To be punished.”"
7614,"Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the"
7615,"vases and baskets of dried flowers, but was not at all surprised that the"
7616,"locket was not there. He gave the office one last sweeping look, and"
7617,his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small
7618,"rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk."
7619,"Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized"
7620,the moment he touched it that it was not a mirror at all. Dumble-
7621,dore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy book.
7622,Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across
7623,his hat — The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore — nor the slightly
7624,"smaller writing across his chest: “by Rita Skeeter, bestselling author"
7625,of Armando Dippet: Master or Moron?”
7626,  252   
7627,THE MUGGLE-BORN
7628,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
7629,Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photo-
7630,"graph of two teenage boys, both laughing immoderately with their"
7631,"arms around each other’s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with elbow-"
7632,"length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on"
7633,Krum’s chin that had so annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in si-
7634,"lent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild look about"
7635,him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered
7636,"whether it was a young Doge, but before he could check the caption,"
7637,the door of the office opened.
7638,If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he en-
7639,"tered, Harry would not have had time to pull the Invisibility Cloak"
7640,"over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have caught"
7641,"a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained"
7642,"quite still, staring curiously at the place where Harry had just"
7643,vanished. Perhaps deciding that all he had seen was Dumbledore
7644,"scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily"
7645,"replaced it upon the shelf, Thicknesse finally walked to the desk"
7646,and pointed his wand at the quill standing ready in the ink pot. It
7647,"sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly,"
7648,"hardly daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the"
7649,open area beyond.
7650,The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of
7651,"the Decoy Detonator, which continued to hoot feebly as it smoked."
7652,"Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, “I bet"
7653,"it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they’re so careless,"
7654,remember that poisonous duck?”
7655,"Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had"
7656,"never been likely that the locket was here at the Ministry, and there"
7657,was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of Umbridge while
7658,  253  
7659,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7660,she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to
7661,"leave the Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another"
7662,"day. The first thing to do was to find Ron, and then they could work"
7663,out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom.
7664,The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled
7665,off the Invisibility Cloak as it started its descent. To his enormous
7666,"relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and wild-"
7667,eyed Ron got in.
7668,"“M-morning,” he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again."
7669,"“Ron, it’s me, Harry!”"
7670,"“Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like — why isn’t Her-"
7671,mione with you?”
7672,"“She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she"
7673,"couldn’t refuse, and —”"
7674,But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again: The
7675,"doors opened and Mr. Weasley walked inside, talking to an el-"
7676,derly witch whose blonde hair was teased so high it resembled an
7677,anthill.
7678,"“. . . I quite understand what you’re saying, Wakanda, but I’m"
7679,afraid I cannot be party to —”
7680,Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange
7681,to have Mr. Weasley glare at him with that much dislike. The lift
7682,doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once more.
7683,"“Oh, hello, Reg,” said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound"
7684,of steady dripping from Ron’s robes. “Isn’t your wife in for question-
7685,ing today? Er — what’s happened to you? Why are you so wet?”
7686,"“Yaxley’s office is raining,” said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley’s"
7687,"shoulder, and Harry felt sure he was scared that his father might rec-"
7688,ognize him if they looked directly into each other’s eyes. “I couldn’t
7689,  254   
7690,THE MUGGLE-BORN

7692,"stop it, so they’ve sent me to get Bernie — Pillsworth, I think they"
7693,said —”
7694,"“Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,” said Mr. Weasley."
7695,“Did you try Meteolojinx Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.”
7696,"“Meteolojinx Recanto?” whispered Ron. “No, I didn’t. Thanks,"
7697,"D — I mean, thanks, Arthur.”"
7698,"The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left,"
7699,"and Ron darted past her out of sight. Harry made to follow him,"
7700,"but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, his"
7701,nose buried in some papers he was reading.
7702,Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he
7703,"was in a lift with his father. He glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned"
7704,"radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened again. For"
7705,"the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way"
7706,blocked by Mr. Weasley’s arm.
7707,"“One moment, Runcorn.”"
7708,"The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr."
7709,"Weasley said, “I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell.”"
7710,Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley’s anger was no less
7711,because of the brush with Percy. He decided his best chance was
7712,to act stupid.
7713,“Sorry?” he said.
7714,"“Don’t pretend, Runcorn,” said Mr. Weasley fiercely. “You tracked"
7715,"down the wizard who faked his family tree, didn’t you?”"
7716,“I — so what if I did?” said Harry.
7717,"“So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,” said Mr."
7718,"Weasley quietly, as the lift sank ever lower. “And if he survives Az-"
7719,"kaban, you’ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, his"
7720,"sons, and his friends —”"
7721, 255 
7722,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7723,"“Arthur,” Harry interrupted, “you know you’re being tracked,"
7724,don’t you?”
7725,"“Is that a threat, Runcorn?” said Mr. Weasley loudly."
7726,"“No,” said Harry, “it’s a fact! They’re watching your every"
7727,move —”
7728,The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley
7729,gave Harry a scathing look and swept from the lift. Harry stood
7730,"there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody other"
7731,than Runcorn. . . . The lift doors clanged shut.
7732,Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He
7733,would try to extricate Hermione on his own while Ron was dealing
7734,"with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out into"
7735,a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled
7736,"and carpeted corridors above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry"
7737,"shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door that marked"
7738,the entrance to the Department of Mysteries.
7739,"He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway"
7740,"he remembered on the left-hand side, which opened onto the flight"
7741,of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with pos-
7742,sibilities as he crept down them: He still had a couple of Decoy
7743,"Detonators, but perhaps it would be better to simply knock on the"
7744,"courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick word with"
7745,"Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was suf-"
7746,"ficiently important to get away with this, and even if he managed"
7747,"it, Hermione’s non-reappearance might trigger a search before they"
7748,were clear of the Ministry. . . .
7749,"Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural"
7750,"chill that was creeping over him, as if he were descending into fog."
7751,It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took: a cold
7752,  256 
7753,THE MUGGLE-BORN
7754,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
7755,that reached right down into his throat and tore at his lungs. And
7756,"then he felt that stealing sense of despair, of hopelessness, filling"
7757,"him, expanding inside him. . . ."
7758,"Dementors, he thought."
7759,And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he
7760,saw a dreadful scene. The dark passage outside the courtrooms was
7761,"packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely hid-"
7762,"den, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified"
7763,Muggle-borns brought in for questioning sat huddled and shivering
7764,on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their faces in
7765,"their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves"
7766,from the dementors’ greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by
7767,"families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding up and down"
7768,"in front of them, and the cold, and the hopelessness, and the despair"
7769,of the place laid themselves upon Harry like a curse. . . .
7770,"Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure"
7771,a Patronus here without revealing himself instantly. So he moved
7772,"forward as silently as he could, and with every step he took numb-"
7773,"ness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think"
7774,"of Hermione and of Ron, who needed him."
7775,Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying: The
7776,"eyeless faces hidden beneath their hoods turned as he passed, and he"
7777,"felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human presence"
7778,"that still had some hope, some resilience. . . ."
7779,"And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one"
7780,of the dungeon doors on the left of the corridor was flung open and
7781,screams echoed out of it.
7782,"“No, no, I’m half-blood, I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was"
7783,"a wizard, he was, look him up, Arkie Alderton, he’s a well-known"
7784, 257  

7786,"broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you — get your hands off"
7787,"me, get your hands off —”"
7788,"“This is your final warning,” said Umbridge’s soft voice, magi-"
7789,cally magnified so that it sounded clearly over the man’s desperate
7790,"screams. “If you struggle, you will be subjected to the Dementor’s"
7791,Kiss.”
7792,"The man’s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the"
7793,corridor.
7794,"“Take him away,” said Umbridge."
7795,"Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their"
7796,"rotting, scabbed hands clutching the upper arms of a wizard who"
7797,appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the corridor with
7798,"him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him"
7799,from sight.
7800,"“Next — Mary Cattermole,” called Umbridge."
7801,A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot.
7802,"Her dark hair was smoothed back into a bun and she wore long,"
7803,plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed the
7804,"dementors, Harry saw her shudder."
7805,"He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated"
7806,the sight of her walking alone into the dungeon: As the door began
7807,"to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her."
7808,It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated
7809,"for improper use of magic. This one was much smaller, though the"
7810,ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic sense of being
7811,stuck at the bottom of a deep well.
7812,"There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura"
7813,over the place; they stood like faceless sentinels in the corners far-
7814,"thest from the high, raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade, sat"
7815, 258  
7816,THE MUGGLE-BORN
7817,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
7818,"Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as"
7819,"white-faced as Mrs. Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the"
7820,"platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up and down, up"
7821,"and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the pros-"
7822,ecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors: That
7823,"was for the accused to feel, not the accusers."
7824,"“Sit down,” said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice."
7825,Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the
7826,"floor beneath the raised platform. The moment she had sat down,"
7827,chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her there.
7828,“You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?” asked Umbridge.
7829,"Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod."
7830,“Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance
7831,Department?”
7832,Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears.
7833,"“I don’t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!”"
7834,Umbridge ignored her.
7835,"“Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?”"
7836,Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever.
7837,"“They’re frightened, they think I might not come home —”"
7838,"“Spare us,” spat Yaxley. “The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our"
7839,sympathies.”
7840,Mrs. Cattermole’s sobs masked Harry’s footsteps as he made his
7841,way carefully toward the steps that led up to the raised platform. The
7842,"moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat patrolled, he"
7843,felt the change in temperature: It was warm and comfortable here.
7844,"The Patronus, he was sure, was Umbridge’s, and it glowed brightly"
7845,"because she was so happy here, in her element, upholding the twisted"
7846,laws she had helped to write. Slowly and very carefully he edged
7847, 259   
7848,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7849,"his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and Hermi-"
7850,"one, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making"
7851,Hermione jump. He thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon
7852,"Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word might cause"
7853,Hermione alarm. Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs.
7854,"Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance."
7855,"“I’m behind you,” he whispered into Hermione’s ear."
7856,"As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned"
7857,the bottle of ink with which she was supposed to be recording the
7858,"interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating upon"
7859,"Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed."
7860,“A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry
7861,"today, Mrs. Cattermole,” Umbridge was saying. “Eight-and-three-"
7862,"quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you recognize that"
7863,description?”
7864,"Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve."
7865,“Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took
7866,that wand?”
7867,“T-took?” sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. “I didn’t t-take it from any-
7868,body. I b-bought it when I was eleven years old. It — it — it —
7869,chose me.”
7870,She cried harder than ever.
7871,Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to
7872,"attack her. She leaned forward over the barrier, the better to observe"
7873,"her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and dangled"
7874,over the void: the locket.
7875,"Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge"
7876,"and Yaxley, still intent upon their prey, were deaf to everything"
7877,else.

7881,"“No,” said Umbridge, “no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole."
7882,Wands only choose witches or wizards. You are not a witch. I have
7883,your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here —
7884,"Mafalda, pass them to me.”"
7885,Umbridge held out a small hand: She looked so toadlike at that
7886,moment that Harry was quite surprised not to see webs between
7887,the stubby fingers. Hermione’s hands were shaking with shock. She
7888,"fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her,"
7889,finally withdrawing a sheaf of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole’s
7890,name on it.
7891,"“That’s — that’s pretty, Dolores,” she said, pointing at the pen-"
7892,dant gleaming in the ruffled folds of Umbridge’s blouse.
7893,"“What?” snapped Umbridge, glancing down. “Oh yes — an old"
7894,"family heirloom,” she said, patting the locket lying on her large bo-"
7895,som. “The S stands for Selwyn. . . . I am related to the Selwyns. . . .
7896,"Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related."
7897,". . . A pity,” she continued in a louder voice, flicking through Mrs."
7898,"Cattermole’s questionnaire, “that the same cannot be said for you."
7899,‘Parents’ professions: greengrocers.’ ”
7900,"Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up"
7901,"and down, and the dementors stood waiting in the corners."
7902,It was Umbridge’s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry’s
7903,brain and obliterated his sense of caution — that the locket she
7904,had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to bol-
7905,"ster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even"
7906,"troubling to keep it concealed beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and"
7907,"said, “Stupefy!”"
7908,There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her fore-
7909,head hit the edge of the balustrade: Mrs. Cattermole’s papers slid
7910,  261 
7911,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7912,"off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling silver cat"
7913,"vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind: Yaxley, con-"
7914,"fused, looked around for the source of the trouble and saw Harry’s"
7915,disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried to draw his
7916,"own wand, but too late: “Stupefy!”"
7917,Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor.
7918,“Harry!”
7919,"“Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her"
7920,pretend —”
7921,"“Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!”"
7922,"Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down"
7923,"below, the dementors had moved out of their corners; they were"
7924,gliding toward the woman chained to the chair: Whether because
7925,the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters
7926,"were no longer in control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint."
7927,"Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear as a slimy, scabbed"
7928,hand grasped her chin and forced her face back.
7929,“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
7930,The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry’s wand and leaped
7931,"toward the dementors, which fell back and melted into the dark"
7932,"shadows again. The stag’s light, more powerful and more warming"
7933,"than the cat’s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered"
7934,around and around the room.
7935,"“Get the Horcrux,” Harry told Hermione."
7936,"He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak back"
7937,"into his bag, and approached Mrs. Cattermole."
7938,"“You?” she whispered, gazing into his face. “But — but Reg said"
7939,you were the one who submitted my name for questioning!”
7940,"“Did I?” muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms."

7944,"“Well, I’ve had a change of heart. Diffindo!” Nothing happened."
7945,"“Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?”"
7946,"“Wait, I’m trying something up here —”"
7947,"“Hermione, we’re surrounded by dementors!”"
7948,"“I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket’s gone"
7949,— I need to duplicate it — Geminio! There . . . That should fool
7950,her. . . .”
7951,Hermione came running downstairs.
7952,“Let’s see. . . . Relashio!”
7953,The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs.
7954,Cattermole looked just as frightened as ever before.
7955,"“I don’t understand,” she whispered."
7956,"“You’re going to leave here with us,” said Harry, pulling her to"
7957,"her feet. “Go home, grab your children, and get out, get out of the"
7958,country if you’ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You’ve seen
7959,"how it is, you won’t get anything like a fair hearing here.”"
7960,"“Harry,” said Hermione, “how are we going to get out of here"
7961,with all those dementors outside the door?”
7962,"“Patronuses,” said Harry, pointing his wand at his own: The stag"
7963,"slowed and walked, still gleaming brightly, toward the door. “As"
7964,"many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.”"
7965,"“Expec — Expecto patronum,” said Hermione. Nothing hap-"
7966,pened.
7967,"“It’s the only spell she ever has trouble with,” Harry told a com-"
7968,"pletely bemused Mrs. Cattermole. “Bit unfortunate, really . . . Come"
7969,"on, Hermione. . . .”"
7970,“Expecto patronum!”
7971,A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione’s wand and swam
7972,gracefully through the air to join the stag.
7973, 263  
7974,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
7975,"“C’mon,” said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole"
7976,to the door.
7977,When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries
7978,of shock from the people waiting outside. Harry looked around; the
7979,"dementors were falling back on both sides of them, melding into"
7980,"the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures."
7981,“It’s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding
7982,"with your families,” Harry told the waiting Muggle-borns, who were"
7983,dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering slightly.
7984,“Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That’s
7985,"the — er — new official position. Now, if you’ll just follow the Pa-"
7986,"tronuses, you’ll be able to leave from the Atrium.”"
7987,"They managed to get up the stone steps without being intercepted,"
7988,but as they approached the lifts Harry started to have misgivings.
7989,"If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, an otter soaring"
7990,"alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-"
7991,"borns, he could not help feeling that they would attract unwanted"
7992,attention. He had just reached this unwelcome conclusion when the
7993,lift clanged to a halt in front of them.
7994,"“Reg!” screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into"
7995,"Ron’s arms. “Runcorn let me out, he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley,"
7996,"and he’s told all of us to leave the country, I think we’d better do it,"
7997,"Reg, I really do, let’s hurry home and fetch the children and — why"
7998,are you so wet?”
7999,"“Water,” muttered Ron, disengaging himself. “Harry, they know"
8000,"there are intruders inside the Ministry, something about a hole in"
8001,"Umbridge’s office door, I reckon we’ve got five minutes if that —”"
8002,Hermione’s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror-
8003,struck face to Harry.
8004, 264  

8007,"“Harry, if we’re trapped here — !”"
8008,"“We won’t be if we move fast,” said Harry. He addressed the silent"
8009,"group behind them, who were all gawping at him."
8010,“Who’s got wands?”
8011,About half of them raised their hands.
8012,"“Okay, all of you who haven’t got wands need to attach yourself"
8013,to somebody who has. We’ll need to be fast before they stop us.
8014,Come on.”
8015,They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry’s Patro-
8016,nus stood sentinel before the golden grilles as they shut and the lifts
8017,began to rise.
8018,"“Level eight,” said the witch’s cool voice, “Atrium.”"
8019,Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was
8020,"full of people moving from fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off."
8021,“Harry!” squeaked Hermione. “What are we going to — ?”
8022,"“STOP!” Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn"
8023,echoed through the Atrium: The wizards sealing the fireplaces
8024,"froze. “Follow me,” he whispered to the group of terrified Muggle-"
8025,"borns, who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and"
8026,Hermione.
8027,"“What’s up, Albert?” said the same balding wizard who had fol-"
8028,lowed Harry out of the fireplace earlier. He looked nervous.
8029,"“This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,” said Harry with"
8030,all the authority he could muster.
8031,The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.
8032,“We’ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone —”
8033,“Are you contradicting me?” Harry blustered. “Would you like me
8034,"to have your family tree examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell’s?”"
8035,"“Sorry!” gasped the balding wizard, backing away. “I didn’t mean"
8036, 265   
8037,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
8038,"nothing, Albert, but I thought . . . I thought they were in for ques-"
8039,tioning and . . .”
8040,"“Their blood is pure,” said Harry, and his deep voice echoed im-"
8041,"pressively through the hall. “Purer than many of yours, I daresay."
8042,"Off you go,” he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried forward"
8043,into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wiz-
8044,"ards hung back, some looking confused, others scared and resent-"
8045,ful. Then:
8046,“Mary!”
8047,Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Catter-
8048,"mole, no longer vomiting but pale and wan, had just come running"
8049,out of a lift.
8050,“R-Reg?”
8051,"She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly."
8052,"The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one"
8053,Reg Cattermole to the other.
8054,“Hey — what’s going on? What is this?”
8055,“Seal the exit! SEAL IT!”
8056,Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the
8057,"group beside the fireplaces, into which all of the Muggle-borns but"
8058,Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard lifted
8059,"his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending"
8060,him flying through the air.
8061,"“He’s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!” Harry"
8062,shouted.
8063,"The balding wizard’s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of"
8064,"which Ron grabbed Mrs. Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open"
8065,"fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked from Harry to"
8066, 266   
8067,THE MUGGLE-BORN
8068,REGISTRATION COMMISSION
8069,"the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, “My"
8070,wife! Who was that with my wife? What’s going on?”
8071,"Harry saw Yaxley’s head turn, saw an inkling of the truth dawn"
8072,in that brutish face.
8073,“Come on!” Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and
8074,they jumped into the fireplace together as Yaxley’s curse sailed over
8075,Harry’s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting up out of
8076,a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door; Ron was standing
8077,"there beside the sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole."
8078,"“Reg, I don’t understand —”"
8079,"“Let go, I’m not your husband, you’ve got to go home!”"
8080,There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked
8081,around; Yaxley had just appeared.
8082,“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand
8083,and Ron by the arm and turned on the spot.
8084,"Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing"
8085,"bands, but something was wrong. . . . Hermione’s hand seemed to"
8086,be sliding out of his grip. . . .
8087,He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not
8088,breathe or see and the only solid things in the world were Ron’s arm
8089,"and Hermione’s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. . . ."
8090,"And then he saw the door of number twelve, Grimmauld Place,"
8091,"with its serpent door knocker, but before he could draw breath, there"
8092,was a scream and a flash of purple light; Hermione’s hand was sud-
8093,denly vicelike upon his and everything went dark again.
8094, 267 
8095,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8096,THE THIEF
8097,H          arry opened his eyes and was dazzled by gold and green;
8098,"he had no idea what had happened, he only knew that"
8099,he was lying on what seemed to be leaves and twigs. Struggling to
8100,"draw breath into lungs that felt flattened, he blinked and realized"
8101,that the gaudy glare was sunlight streaming through a canopy of
8102,leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He
8103,"pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small,"
8104,"fierce creature, but saw that the object was Ron’s foot. Looking"
8105,"around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a forest"
8106,"floor, apparently alone."
8107,"Harry’s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a mo-"
8108,"ment, even though he knew how foolish and dangerous it would"
8109,"be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt"
8110,at the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid’s hut. How-
8111,"ever, in the few moments it took for Ron to give a low groan and"
8112,"Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the"
8113,  268 
8114,THE THIEF
8115,"Forbidden Forest: The trees looked younger, they were more widely"
8116,"spaced, the ground clearer."
8117,"He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron’s head."
8118,"The moment his eyes fell upon Ron, all other concerns fled Harry’s"
8119,"mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron’s left side and his face"
8120,"stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice"
8121,Potion was wearing off now: Ron was halfway between Cattermole
8122,"and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and redder as"
8123,his face drained of the little color it had left.
8124,“What’s happened to him?”
8125,"“Splinched,” said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron’s"
8126,"sleeve, where the blood was wettest and darkest."
8127,"Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron’s shirt. He had"
8128,"always thought of Splinching as something comical, but this . . ."
8129,His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron’s up-
8130,"per arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly"
8131,away as though by a knife.
8132,"“Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence"
8133,of Dittany’ —”
8134,“Bag — right —”
8135,"Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the"
8136,"tiny beaded bag, and thrust his hand inside it. At once, object after"
8137,object began presenting itself to his touch: He felt the leather spines
8138,"of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes —"
8139,“Quickly!”
8140,He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the
8141,depths of the magical bag.
8142,“Accio Dittany!”
8143,A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and
8144, 269   
8145,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8146,"hastened back to Hermione and Ron, whose eyes were now half-"
8147,"closed, strips of white eyeball all that were visible between his lids."
8148,"“He’s fainted,” said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no"
8149,"longer looked like Mafalda, though her hair was still gray in places."
8150,"“Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.”"
8151,"Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle, Hermione took"
8152,it and poured three drops of the potion onto the bleeding wound.
8153,"Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry"
8154,saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several
8155,days old; new skin stretched over what had just been open flesh.
8156,"“Wow,” said Harry."
8157,"“It’s all I feel safe doing,” said Hermione shakily. “There are spells"
8158,"that would put him completely right, but I daren’t try in case I do"
8159,them wrong and cause more damage. . . . He’s lost so much blood
8160,already. . . .”
8161,"“How did he get hurt? I mean” — Harry shook his head, trying"
8162,"to clear it, to make sense of whatever had just taken place — “why"
8163,are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place?”
8164,Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.
8165,"“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to go back there.”"
8166,“What d’you — ?”
8167,"“As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn’t"
8168,"get rid of him, he was too strong, and he was still holding on when"
8169,"we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then — well, I think he must"
8170,"have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he"
8171,slackened his grip and I managed to shake him off and I brought us
8172,here instead!”
8173,"“But then, where’s he? Hang on. . . . You don’t mean he’s at Grim-"
8174,mauld Place? He can’t get in there?”
8175,  270 
8176,THE THIEF
8177,Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded.
8178,"“Harry, I think he can. I — I forced him to let go with a Revul-"
8179,"sion Jinx, but I’d already taken him inside the Fidelius Charm’s"
8180,"protection. Since Dumbledore died, we’re Secret-Keepers, so I’ve"
8181,"given him the secret, haven’t I?”"
8182,There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was
8183,"a serious blow. If Yaxley could now get inside the house, there was"
8184,"no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing"
8185,other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive
8186,"though the house was, it had been their one safe refuge: even, now"
8187,"that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of home."
8188,"With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry"
8189,imagined the house-elf busying himself over the steak-and-kidney
8190,"pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat."
8191,"“Harry, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry!”"
8192,"“Don’t be stupid, it wasn’t your fault! If anything, it was"
8193,mine. . . .”
8194,Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye’s eye.
8195,"Hermione recoiled, looking horrified."
8196,"“Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn’t"
8197,leave it there . . . but that’s how they knew there were intruders.”
8198,"Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his"
8199,eyes. He was still gray and his face glistened with sweat.
8200,“How d’you feel?” Hermione whispered.
8201,"“Lousy,” croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. “Where"
8202,are we?”
8203,"“In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,” said"
8204,"Hermione. “I wanted somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this"
8205,was —”
8206, 271  
8207,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8208,"“— the first place you thought of,” Harry finished for her, glanc-"
8209,ing around at the apparently deserted glade. He could not help re-
8210,membering what had happened the last time they had Apparated
8211,to the first place Hermione had thought of — how Death Eaters
8212,had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did
8213,"Voldemort or his henchmen know, even now, where Hermione had"
8214,taken them?
8215,"“D’you reckon we should move on?” Ron asked Harry, and"
8216,Harry could tell by the look on Ron’s face that he was thinking
8217,the same.
8218,“I dunno.”
8219,Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit
8220,up and it looked as though he was too weak to do so. The prospect
8221,of moving him was daunting.
8222,"“Let’s stay here for now,” Harry said."
8223,"Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet."
8224,“Where are you going?” asked Ron.
8225,"“If we’re staying, we should put some protective enchantments"
8226,"around the place,” she replied, and raising her wand, she began"
8227,"to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring in-"
8228,cantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the sur-
8229,rounding air: It was as if Hermione had cast a heat haze upon their
8230,clearing.
8231,“Salvio Hexia . . . Protego Totalum . . . Repello Muggletum . . .
8232,"Muffliato . . . You could get out the tent, Harry. . . .”"
8233,“Tent?”
8234,“In the bag!”
8235,"“In the . . . of course,” said Harry."
8236,"He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another"
8237, 272 
8238,THE THIEF
8239,"Summoning Charm. The tent emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas,"
8240,"rope, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the smell of"
8241,"cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the"
8242,Quidditch World Cup.
8243,“I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?”
8244,"he asked, starting to disentangle the tent pegs."
8245,"“Apparently he didn’t want it back, his lumbago’s so bad,” said"
8246,"Hermione, now performing complicated figure-of-eight movements"
8247,"with her wand, “so Ron’s dad said I could borrow it. Erecto!” she"
8248,"added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one"
8249,"fluid motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the"
8250,"ground before Harry, out of whose startled hands a tent peg soared,"
8251,to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope.
8252,"“Cave Inimicum,” Hermione finished with a skyward flourish."
8253,"“That’s as much as I can do. At the very least, we should know"
8254,"they’re coming, I can’t guarantee it will keep out Vol —”"
8255,"“Don’t say the name!” Ron cut across her, his voice harsh."
8256,Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
8257,"“I’m sorry,” Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look"
8258,"at them, “but it feels like a — a jinx or something. Can’t we call him"
8259,You-Know-Who — please?”
8260,“Dumbledore said fear of a name —” began Harry.
8261,"“In case you hadn’t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his"
8262,"name didn’t do Dumbledore much good in the end,” Ron snapped"
8263,"back. “Just — just show You-Know-Who some respect, will you?”"
8264,"“Respect?” Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning"
8265,look; apparently he was not to argue with Ron while the latter was
8266,in such a weakened condition.
8267,"Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through"
8268,  273   
8269,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8270,the entrance of the tent. The interior was exactly as Harry remem-
8271,"bered it: a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny kitchen. He"
8272,shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the
8273,lower berth of a bunk bed. Even this very short journey had turned
8274,"Ron whiter still, and once they had settled him on the mattress he"
8275,closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while.
8276,"“I’ll make some tea,” said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and"
8277,mugs from the depths of her bag and heading toward the kitchen.
8278,Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had
8279,been on the night that Mad-Eye had died; it seemed to burn away
8280,"a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. After a minute or two, Ron"
8281,broke the silence.
8282,“What d’you reckon happened to the Cattermoles?”
8283,"“With any luck, they’ll have got away,” said Hermione, clutching"
8284,her hot mug for comfort. “As long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits
8285,"about him, he’ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by Side-Along-"
8286,Apparition and they’ll be fleeing the country right now with their
8287,children. That’s what Harry told her to do.”
8288,"“Blimey, I hope they escaped,” said Ron, leaning back on his"
8289,pillows. The tea seemed to be doing him good; a little of his color
8290,had returned. “I didn’t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all that
8291,"quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I"
8292,"was him. God, I hope they made it. . . . If they both end up in Az-"
8293,kaban because of us . . .”
8294,Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been
8295,about to ask — about whether Mrs. Cattermole’s lack of a wand
8296,would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband — died in his
8297,throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the
8298,"Cattermoles, and there was such tenderness in her expression that"
8299, 274   
8300,THE THIEF
8301,Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing
8302,him.
8303,"“So, have you got it?” Harry asked her, partly to remind her that"
8304,he was there.
8305,“Got — got what?” she said with a little start.
8306,“What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where’s
8307,the locket?”
8308,"“You got it?” shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his"
8309,"pillows. “No one tells me anything! Blimey, you could have men-"
8310,tioned it!”
8311,"“Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters,"
8312,weren’t we?” said Hermione. “Here.”
8313,And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and
8314,handed it to Ron.
8315,"It was as large as a chicken’s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with"
8316,"many small green stones, glinted dully in the diffused light shining"
8317,through the tent’s canvas roof.
8318,“There isn’t any chance someone’s destroyed it since Kreacher
8319,"had it?” asked Ron hopefully. “I mean, are we sure it’s still a"
8320,Horcrux?”
8321,"“I think so,” said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking"
8322,at it closely. “There’d be some sign of damage if it had been magi-
8323,cally destroyed.”
8324,"She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing"
8325,"looked perfect, pristine. He remembered the mangled remains of"
8326,"the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been cracked"
8327,open when Dumbledore destroyed it.
8328,"“I reckon Kreacher’s right,” said Harry. “We’re going to have to"
8329,work out how to open this thing before we can destroy it.”
8330,  275   
8331,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8332,"Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind"
8333,"the little golden doors, hit Harry as he spoke. Even after all their"
8334,"efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket from him."
8335,"Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his"
8336,"fingers, then attempted the charm Hermione had used to open"
8337,Regulus’s bedroom door. Neither worked. He handed the locket
8338,"back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were"
8339,no more successful at opening it than he had been.
8340,"“Can you feel it, though?” Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he"
8341,held it tight in his clenched fist.
8342,“What d’you mean?”
8343,"Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry. After a moment or two, Harry"
8344,thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing
8345,"through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating"
8346,"inside the locket, like a tiny metal heart?"
8347,“What are we going to do with it?” Hermione asked.
8348,"“Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it,” Harry replied,"
8349,"and, little though he wanted to, he hung the chain around his own"
8350,"neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it"
8351,rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him.
8352,"“I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,”"
8353,"he added to Hermione, standing up and stretching. “And we’ll need"
8354,"to think about some food as well. You stay there,” he added sharply,"
8355,as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.
8356,With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birth-
8357,"day set carefully upon the table in the tent, Harry and Hermione"
8358,"spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However,"
8359,"the Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day,"
8360,and whether because of the protective enchantments and Muggle-
8361, 276   
8362,THE THIEF
8363,"repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because"
8364,"people rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained de-"
8365,"serted, apart from occasional birds and squirrels. Evening brought"
8366,no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione
8367,"at ten o’clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats"
8368,fluttering high above him across the single patch of starry sky visible
8369,from their protected clearing.
8370,"He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had"
8371,"not packed any food in her magical bag, as she had assumed that"
8372,"they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they"
8373,had had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermi-
8374,one had collected from amongst the nearest trees and stewed in a
8375,billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion
8376,"away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as not to hurt"
8377,Hermione’s feelings.
8378,The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what
8379,sounded like crackings of twigs: Harry thought that they were
8380,"caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held"
8381,"tight at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their"
8382,"inadequate helping of rubbery mushrooms, tingled with unease."
8383,He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal
8384,"back the Horcrux, but somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat look-"
8385,"ing out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a tiny part, was"
8386,worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been
8387,"hurtling toward this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but"
8388,"now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of road."
8389,"There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not"
8390,have the faintest idea where they could be. He did not even know
8391,what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know how to
8392, 277   
8393,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8394,"destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that cur-"
8395,"rently lay against the bare flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not"
8396,"taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it might"
8397,"just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought,"
8398,"or perhaps imagined, that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking"
8399,irregularly alongside his own.
8400,Nameless forebodings crept upon him as he sat there in the dark:
8401,"He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came at him relent-"
8402,"lessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione,"
8403,"now talking softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they"
8404,wanted to: He could not. And it seemed to Harry as he sat there
8405,"trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux"
8406,against his chest was ticking away the time he had left. . . . Stupid
8407,"idea, he told himself, don’t think that. . . ."
8408,His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was
8409,"making it happen by having these thoughts, and tried to direct"
8410,"them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who had"
8411,expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the
8412,elf keep silent or would he tell the Death Eater everything he knew?
8413,Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed toward him in
8414,"the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what"
8415,would happen? What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick im-
8416,"ages swarmed into Harry’s head and he tried to push these away too,"
8417,for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher: He and Hermione
8418,had already decided against trying to summon him; what if some-
8419,one from the Ministry came too? They could not count on elfish
8420,Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to
8421,Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione’s sleeve.
8422,Harry’s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much
8423, 278  
8424,THE THIEF
8425,they did not know: Lupin had been right about magic they had
8426,never encountered or imagined. Why hadn’t Dumbledore explained
8427,more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live
8428,"for years, for centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If"
8429,"so, he had been wrong. . . . Snape had seen to that. . . . Snape, the"
8430,"sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower . . ."
8431,And Dumbledore had fallen . . . fallen . . .
8432,"“Give it to me, Gregorovitch.”"
8433,"Harry’s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front"
8434,of him by a long-fingered white hand. The man at whom he was
8435,"pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were"
8436,"no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound,"
8437,"his limbs wrapped about him, his terrified face, on a level with"
8438,"Harry’s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He"
8439,"had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard: a trussed-up Father"
8440,Christmas.
8441,"“I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen"
8442,from me!”
8443,"“Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows. . . . He"
8444,always knows.”
8445,"The hanging man’s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they"
8446,"seemed to swell, bigger and bigger until their blackness swallowed"
8447,Harry whole —
8448,And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little
8449,Gregorovitch’s wake as he held a lantern aloft: Gregorovitch burst
8450,into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern illuminated
8451,what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed
8452,"in the swinging pool of light, and there on the window ledge sat"
8453,"perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. In the"
8454, 279  
8455,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8456,"split second that the lantern’s light illuminated him, Harry saw the"
8457,"delight upon his handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning"
8458,Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward out of the window
8459,with a crow of laughter.
8460,"And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils"
8461,and Gregorovitch’s face was stricken with terror.
8462,"“Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?” said the high cold voice."
8463,"“I do not know, I never knew, a young man — no — please"
8464,— PLEASE !”
8465,A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light —
8466,“Harry!”
8467,"He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had"
8468,"passed out against the side of the tent, had slid sideways down the"
8469,"canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at Hermi-"
8470,"one, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through"
8471,the dark branches high above them.
8472,"“Dream,” he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet"
8473,"Hermione’s glower with a look of innocence. “Must’ve dozed off,"
8474,sorry.”
8475,“I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You
8476,were looking into Vol —”
8477,“Don’t say his name!” came Ron’s angry voice from the depths
8478,of the tent.
8479,"“Fine,” retorted Hermione. “You-Know-Who’s mind, then!”"
8480,“I didn’t mean it to happen!” Harry said. “It was a dream! Can
8481,"you control what you dream about, Hermione?”"
8482,“If you just learned to apply Occlumency —”
8483,But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to dis-
8484,cuss what he had just seen.
8485,  280  
8486,THE THIEF
8487,"“He’s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he’s killed"
8488,"him, but before he killed him he read Gregorovitch’s mind and I"
8489,saw —”
8490,“I think I’d better take over the watch if you’re so tired you’re
8491,"falling asleep,” said Hermione coldly."
8492,“I can finish the watch!”
8493,"“No, you’re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.”"
8494,"She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn."
8495,"Angry, but wishing to avoid a row, Harry ducked back inside."
8496,Ron’s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry
8497,"climbed into the one above him, lay down, and looked up at the dark"
8498,"canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a voice so low"
8499,"that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance."
8500,“What’s You-Know-Who doing?”
8501,"Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail,"
8502,then whispered into the darkness.
8503,"“He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing"
8504,him.”
8505,“How’s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he’s
8506,tied up?”
8507,"“I dunno. . . . It’s weird, isn’t it?”"
8508,"Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all he had seen and heard. The"
8509,"more he recalled, the less sense it made. . . . Voldemort had said"
8510,"nothing about Harry’s wand, nothing about the twin cores, noth-"
8511,ing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to
8512,beat Harry’s. . . .
8513,"“He wanted something from Gregorovitch,” Harry said, eyes still"
8514,"closed tight. “He asked him to hand it over, but Gregorovitch said"
8515,it had been stolen from him . . . and then . . . then . . .”
8516, 281    
8517,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
8518,"He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle"
8519,"through Gregorovitch’s eyes, into his memories. . . ."
8520,"“He read Gregorovitch’s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched"
8521,"on a windowsill, and he fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped"
8522,"out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-Know-Who’s after."
8523,And I . . . I think I’ve seen him somewhere. . . .”
8524,Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing
8525,"boy’s face. The theft had happened many years ago, according to"
8526,Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar?
8527,The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the
8528,"tent; all Harry could hear was Ron’s breathing. After a while, Ron"
8529,"whispered, “Couldn’t you see what the thief was holding?”"
8530,“No . . . it must’ve been something small.”
8531,“Harry?”
8532,The wooden slats of Ron’s bunk creaked as he repositioned him-
8533,self in bed.
8534,"“Harry, you don’t reckon You-Know-Who’s after something else"
8535,to turn into a Horcrux?”
8536,"“I don’t know,” said Harry slowly. “Maybe. But wouldn’t it be"
8537,dangerous for him to make another one? Didn’t Hermione say he
8538,had pushed his soul to the limit already?”
8539,"“Yeah, but maybe he doesn’t know that.”"
8540,"“Yeah . . . maybe,” said Harry."
8541,He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way
8542,"around the problem of the twin cores, sure that Voldemort sought"
8543,"a solution from the old wandmaker . . . and yet he had killed him,"
8544,apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore.
8545,"What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of"
8546,"Magic and the Wizarding world at his feet, was he far away, intent"
8547, 282 
8548,THE THIEF
8549,"on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, and"
8550,which had been stolen by the unknown thief?
8551,"Harry could still see the blond-haired youth’s face; it was merry,"
8552,wild; there was a Fred and George-ish air of triumphant trickery
8553,"about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, and"
8554,"Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. . . ."
8555,"With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was"
8556,"in danger now, and it was on him that Harry’s thoughts dwelled, as"
8557,Ron’s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he himself
8558,drifted slowly into sleep once more.
8559, 283 
8560,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8561,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8562,"E     arly next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left"
8563,"the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most"
8564,"gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow"
8565,he buried Mad-Eye Moody’s eye and marked the spot by gouging a
8566,"small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry"
8567,felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on
8568,Dolores Umbridge’s door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the
8569,"others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next."
8570,Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere
8571,"too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move"
8572,took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore re-
8573,"moved the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while"
8574,Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the
8575,ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disap-
8576,parated to the outskirts of a small market town.
8577,Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of
8578,  284  
8579,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8580,"trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments,"
8581,Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance.
8582,"This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the"
8583,"town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden"
8584,darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.
8585,"“But you can make a brilliant Patronus!” protested Ron, when"
8586,"Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and"
8587,"mouthing the single word, dementors."
8588,"“I couldn’t . . . make one,” he panted, clutching the stitch in his"
8589,side. “Wouldn’t . . . come.”
8590,Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made
8591,"Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing"
8592,"the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing,"
8593,as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming
8594,"filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself."
8595,It had taken all Harry’s willpower to uproot himself from the spot
8596,"and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles"
8597,"who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the"
8598,despair they cast wherever they went.
8599,“So we still haven’t got any food.”
8600,"“Shut up, Ron,” snapped Hermione. “Harry, what happened?"
8601,Why do you think you couldn’t make your Patronus? You managed
8602,perfectly yesterday!”
8603,“I don’t know.”
8604,"He sat low in one of Perkins’s old armchairs, feeling more humili-"
8605,ated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong
8606,inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago: Today he might have
8607,"been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the"
8608,Hogwarts Express.
8609, 285  
8610,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8611,Ron kicked a chair leg.
8612,“What?” he snarled at Hermione. “I’m starving! All I’ve had since
8613,I bled half to death is a couple of toadstools!”
8614,"“You go and fight your way through the dementors, then,” said"
8615,"Harry, stung."
8616,"“I would, but my arm’s in a sling, in case you hadn’t noticed!”"
8617,‘“That’s convenient.”
8618,“And what’s that supposed to — ?”
8619,"“Of course!” cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead"
8620,"and startling both of them into silence. “Harry, give me the locket!"
8621,"Come on,” she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he"
8622,"did not react, “the Horcrux, Harry, you’re still wearing it!”"
8623,"She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over"
8624,his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry’s skin he felt
8625,free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy
8626,or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both
8627,sensations lifted.
8628,“Better?” asked Hermione.
8629,"“Yeah, loads better!”"
8630,"“Harry,” she said, crouching down in front of him and using the"
8631,"kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, “you don’t"
8632,"think you’ve been possessed, do you?”"
8633,“What? No!” he said defensively. “I remember everything we’ve
8634,done while I’ve been wearing it. I wouldn’t know what I’d done if
8635,"I’d been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when"
8636,she couldn’t remember anything.”
8637,"“Hmm,” said Hermione, looking down at the heavy gold locket."
8638,"“Well, maybe we ought not to wear it. We can just keep it in the"
8639,tent.”
8640, 286   
8641,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8642,"“We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around,” Harry stated"
8643,"firmly. “If we lose it, if it gets stolen —”"
8644,"“Oh, all right, all right,” said Hermione, and she placed it around"
8645,her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt.
8646,"“But we’ll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long.”"
8647,"“Great,” said Ron irritably, “and now we’ve sorted that out, can"
8648,we please get some food?”
8649,"“Fine, but we’ll go somewhere else to find it,” said Hermione with"
8650,half a glance at Harry. “There’s no point staying where we know
8651,dementors are swooping around.”
8652,In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung field be-
8653,"longing to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain"
8654,eggs and bread.
8655,"“It’s not stealing, is it?” asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as"
8656,they devoured scrambled eggs on toast. “Not if I left some money
8657,under the chicken coop?”
8658,"Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, “ ’Er-my-"
8659,"nee, ’oo worry ’oo much. ’Elax!”"
8660,"And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were com-"
8661,fortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten
8662,"in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he"
8663,took the first of the three night watches.
8664,This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach
8665,"meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry"
8666,"was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near"
8667,starvation at the Dursleys’. Hermione bore up reasonably well on
8668,those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or
8669,"stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her"
8670,"silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three"
8671, 287   
8672,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8673,"delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts"
8674,"house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible."
8675,Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron’s turn to wear the Hor-
8676,"crux, he became downright unpleasant."
8677,“So where next?” was his constant refrain. He did not seem to
8678,"have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come"
8679,up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies.
8680,Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to
8681,"decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to de-"
8682,"stroy the one they had already got, their conversations becoming"
8683,increasingly repetitive as they had no new information.
8684,As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had
8685,"hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept recit-"
8686,"ing, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Volde-"
8687,mort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born
8688,"and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and"
8689,"Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Alba-"
8690,"nia, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis"
8691,of their speculations.
8692,"“Yeah, let’s go to Albania. Shouldn’t take more than an afternoon"
8693,"to search an entire country,” said Ron sarcastically."
8694,“There can’t be anything there. He’d already made five of his
8695,"Horcruxes before he went into exile, and Dumbledore was certain"
8696,"the snake is the sixth,” said Hermione. “We know the snake’s not"
8697,"in Albania, it’s usually with Vol —”"
8698,“Didn’t I ask you to stop saying that?”
8699,“Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who — happy?”
8700,“Not particularly.”
8701,"“I can’t see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes,” said"
8702, 288  
8703,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8704,"Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again"
8705,simply to break the nasty silence. “Borgin and Burke were experts at
8706,"Dark objects, they would’ve recognized a Horcrux straightaway.”"
8707,Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw some-
8708,"thing at him, Harry plowed on, “I still reckon he might have hidden"
8709,something at Hogwarts.”
8710,Hermione sighed.
8711,"“But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!”"
8712,Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of
8713,this theory.
8714,“Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew
8715,"all of Hogwarts’s secrets. I’m telling you, if there was one place"
8716,Vol —”
8717,“Oi!”
8718,"“YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!” Harry shouted, goaded past en-"
8719,durance. “If there was one place that was really important to You-
8720,"Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!”"
8721,"“Oh, come on,” scoffed Ron. “His school ?”"
8722,"“Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he"
8723,"was special; it meant everything to him, and even after he left —”"
8724,"“This is You-Know-Who we’re talking about, right? Not you?”"
8725,inquired Ron. He was tugging at the chain of the Horcrux around
8726,his neck: Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him.
8727,“You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him
8728,"a job after he left,” said Hermione."
8729,"“That’s right,” said Harry."
8730,“And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try
8731,"and find something, probably another founder’s object, to make"
8732,into another Horcrux?”
8733,  289    
8734,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8735,"“Yeah,” said Harry."
8736,"“But he didn’t get the job, did he?” said Hermione. “So he never"
8737,got the chance to find a founder’s object there and hide it in the
8738,school!”
8739,"“Okay, then,” said Harry, defeated. “Forget Hogwarts.”"
8740,"Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden"
8741,"beneath the Invisibility Cloak, searched for the orphanage in which"
8742,Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and dis-
8743,covered from their records that the place had been demolished many
8744,years before. They visited its site and found a tower block of offices.
8745,“We could try digging in the foundations?” Hermione suggested
8746,halfheartedly.
8747,"“He wouldn’t have hidden a Horcrux here,” Harry said. He had"
8748,known it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort
8749,had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part
8750,of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort
8751,sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray
8752,corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from
8753,"Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizard-"
8754,"ing bank, with its golden doors and marble floors."
8755,"Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through"
8756,"the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for"
8757,security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all
8758,"clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and se-"
8759,"cluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy"
8760,"crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides,"
8761,and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they
8762,passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some
8763,"perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded"
8764, 290  
8765,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8766,the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased
8767,fear and anxiety.
8768,"Harry’s scar kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed,"
8769,when he was wearing the Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop
8770,himself reacting to the pain.
8771,"“What? What did you see?” demanded Ron, whenever he noticed"
8772,Harry wince.
8773,"“A face,” muttered Harry, every time. “The same face. The thief"
8774,who stole from Gregorovitch.”
8775,"And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disap-"
8776,pointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his
8777,"family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he,"
8778,"Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort"
8779,"was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Ap-"
8780,parently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth
8781,"with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure,"
8782,Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry’s scar continued
8783,"to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his"
8784,"memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for"
8785,the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the
8786,"thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desper-"
8787,ate for a lead on the Horcruxes.
8788,"As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that"
8789,"Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about,"
8790,him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry en-
8791,"tered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled"
8792,"a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times"
8793,they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and
8794,hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.
8795,  291   
8796,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8797,Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed
8798,to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey be-
8799,cause they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn
8800,"in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood,"
8801,and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed
8802,by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further
8803,"Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him"
8804,"was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely,"
8805,he stopped suggesting it.
8806,Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it:
8807,They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural
8808,mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to
8809,their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better at iden-
8810,tifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their con-
8811,"tinuing isolation, the lack of other people’s company, or their total"
8812,ignorance of what was going on in the war against Voldemort.
8813,"“My mother,” said Ron one night, as they sat in the tent on a"
8814,"riverbank in Wales, “can make good food appear out of thin air.”"
8815,He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his
8816,"plate. Harry glanced automatically at Ron’s neck and saw, as he"
8817,"had expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He"
8818,"managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude"
8819,"would, he knew, improve slightly when the time came to take off"
8820,the locket.
8821,"“Your mother can’t produce food out of thin air,” said Hermione."
8822,“No one can. Food is the first of the five Principal Exceptions to
8823,Gamp’s Law of Elemental Transfigur —”
8824,"“Oh, speak English, can’t you?” Ron said, prising a fish bone out"
8825,from between his teeth.
8826, 292  
8827,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8828,“It’s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Sum-
8829,"mon it if you know where it is, you can transform it, you can increase"
8830,the quantity if you’ve already got some —”
8831,"“Well, don’t bother increasing this, it’s disgusting,” said Ron."
8832,“Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I’m al-
8833,"ways the one who ends up sorting out the food, because I’m a girl,"
8834,I suppose!”
8835,"“No, it’s because you’re supposed to be the best at magic!” shot"
8836,back Ron.
8837,Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike slid off her tin plate
8838,onto the floor.
8839,"“You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingre-"
8840,"dients and try and charm them into something worth eating, and"
8841,I’ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see how you —”
8842,"“Shut up!” said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both"
8843,hands. “Shut up now!”
8844,Hermione looked outraged.
8845,"“How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook —”"
8846,"“Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!”"
8847,"He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not"
8848,"to talk. Then, over the rush and gush of the dark river beside them,"
8849,he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It was
8850,not moving.
8851,"“You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?” he whispered to"
8852,Hermione.
8853,"“I did everything,” she whispered back, “Muffliato, Muggle-"
8854,"Repelling and Disillusionment Charms, all of it. They shouldn’t be"
8855,"able to hear or see us, whoever they are.”"
8856,"Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged"
8857, 293 
8858,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8859,"stones and twigs, told them that several people were clambering"
8860,"down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow bank"
8861,"where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting."
8862,The enchantments they had cast around themselves ought to be suf-
8863,"ficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the notice"
8864,of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death
8865,"Eaters, then perhaps their defenses were about to be tested by Dark"
8866,Magic for the first time.
8867,The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of
8868,men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer
8869,"than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to"
8870,tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to
8871,rummage; after a moment she drew out three Extendable Ears and
8872,"threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily inserted the ends of"
8873,the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out
8874,of the tent entrance.
8875,Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice.
8876,"“There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d’you reckon it’s too"
8877,early in the season? Accio Salmon!”
8878,There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds
8879,of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed
8880,the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the
8881,"river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking"
8882,English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough
8883,"and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and"
8884,"there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower"
8885,voice than the other.
8886,A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas; large shad-
8887,ows passed between tent and flames. The delicious smell of baking
8888, 294  
8889,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8890,salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the clink-
8891,"ing of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again."
8892,"“Here, Griphook, Gornuk.”"
8893,"Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded."
8894,"“Thank you,” said the goblins together in English."
8895,"“So, you three have been on the run how long?” asked a new,"
8896,"mellow, and pleasant voice; it was vaguely familiar to Harry, who"
8897,"pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man."
8898,"“Six weeks . . . seven . . . I forget,” said the tired man. “Met up"
8899,with Griphook in the first couple of days and joined forces with
8900,Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.” There was
8901,"a pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up"
8902,"and replaced on the ground. “What made you leave, Ted?” contin-"
8903,ued the man.
8904,"“Knew they were coming for me,” replied mellow-voiced Ted, and"
8905,Harry suddenly knew who he was: Tonks’s father. “Heard Death
8906,Eaters were in the area last week and decided I’d better run for it.
8907,"Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew"
8908,"it was a matter of time, knew I’d have to leave in the end. My wife"
8909,"should be okay, she’s pure-blood. And then I met Dean here, what,"
8910,"a few days ago, son?”"
8911,"“Yeah,” said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared"
8912,"at each other, silent but beside themselves with excitement, sure they"
8913,"recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow Gryffindor."
8914,"“Muggle-born, eh?” asked the first man."
8915,"“Not sure,” said Dean. “My dad left my mum when I was a kid."
8916,"I’ve got no proof he was a wizard, though.”"
8917,"There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching;"
8918,then Ted spoke again.
8919,  295  
8920,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8921,"“I’ve got to say, Dirk, I’m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but"
8922,surprised. Word was you’d been caught.”
8923,"“I was,” said Dirk. “I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a"
8924,"break for it, Stunned Dawlish, and nicked his broom. It was easier"
8925,than you’d think; I don’t reckon he’s quite right at the moment.
8926,"Might be Confunded. If so, I’d like to shake the hand of the witch"
8927,"or wizard who did it, probably saved my life.”"
8928,There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river
8929,"rushed on. Then Ted said, “And where do you two fit in? I, er,"
8930,"had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the"
8931,whole.”
8932,"“You had a false impression,” said the higher-voiced of the goblins."
8933,“We take no sides. This is a wizards’ war.”
8934,"“How come you’re in hiding, then?”"
8935,"“I deemed it prudent,” said the deeper-voiced goblin. “Having"
8936,"refused what I considered an impertinent request, I could see that"
8937,my personal safety was in jeopardy.”
8938,“What did they ask you to do?” asked Ted.
8939,"“Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,” replied the goblin, his"
8940,voice rougher and less human as he said it. “I am not a house-elf.”
8941,"“What about you, Griphook?”"
8942,"“Similar reasons,” said the higher-voiced goblin. “Gringotts is no"
8943,longer under the sole control of my race. I recognize no Wizarding
8944,master.”
8945,"He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and"
8946,Gornuk laughed.
8947,“What’s the joke?” asked Dean.
8948,"“He said,” replied Dirk, “that there are things wizards don’t rec-"
8949,"ognize, either.”"
8950, 296   
8951,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
8952,There was a short pause.
8953,"“I don’t get it,” said Dean."
8954,"“I had my small revenge before I left,” said Griphook in English."
8955,"“Good man — goblin, I should say,” amended Ted hastily."
8956,“Didn’t manage to lock a Death Eater up in one of the old high-
8957,"security vaults, I suppose?”"
8958,"“If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,” re-"
8959,plied Griphook. Gornuk laughed again and even Dirk gave a dry
8960,chuckle.
8961,"“Dean and I are still missing something here,” said Ted."
8962,"“So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,” said Griphook,"
8963,and the two goblins roared with malicious laughter. Inside the tent
8964,Harry’s breathing was shallow with excitement: He and Hermione
8965,"stared at each other, listening as hard as they could."
8966,"“Didn’t you hear about that, Ted?” asked Dirk. “About the"
8967,kids who tried to steal Gryffindor’s sword out of Snape’s office at
8968,Hogwarts?”
8969,"An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his"
8970,every nerve as he stood rooted to the spot.
8971,"“Never heard a word,” said Ted. “Not in the Prophet, was it?”"
8972,"“Hardly,” chortled Dirk. “Griphook here told me, he heard about"
8973,it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank. One of the kids who
8974,tried to take the sword was Bill’s younger sister.”
8975,"Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were"
8976,clutching the Extendable Ears as tightly as lifelines.
8977,“She and a couple of friends got into Snape’s office and smashed
8978,open the glass case where he was apparently keeping the sword.
8979,Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the
8980,staircase.”
8981, 297  
8982,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
8983,"“Ah, God bless ’em,” said Ted. “What did they think, that"
8984,they’d be able to use the sword on You-Know-Who? Or on Snape
8985,himself?”
8986,"“Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape"
8987,"decided the sword wasn’t safe where it was,” said Dirk. “Couple of"
8988,"days later, once he’d got the say-so from You-Know-Who, I imagine,"
8989,he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.”
8990,The goblins started to laugh again.
8991,"“I’m still not seeing the joke,” said Ted."
8992,"“It’s a fake,” rasped Griphook."
8993,“The sword of Gryffindor!”
8994,"“Oh yes. It is a copy — an excellent copy, it is true — but it was"
8995,Wizard-made. The original was forged centuries ago by goblins and
8996,had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. Wherever
8997,"the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts"
8998,bank.”
8999,"“I see,” said Ted. “And I take it you didn’t bother telling the"
9000,Death Eaters this?”
9001,"“I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,” said"
9002,"Griphook smugly, and now Ted and Dean joined in Gornuk and"
9003,Dirk’s laughter.
9004,"Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask"
9005,"the question he needed answered, and after a minute that seemed"
9006,"ten, Dean obliged; he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-"
9007,boyfriend of Ginny’s too.
9008,“What happened to Ginny and the others? The ones who tried to
9009,steal it?”
9010,"“Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,” said Griphook indif-"
9011,ferently.
9012, 298   
9013,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
9014,"“They’re okay, though?” asked Ted quickly. “I mean, the Weasleys"
9015,"don’t need any more of their kids injured, do they?”"
9016,"“They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,” said"
9017,Griphook.
9018,"“Lucky for them,” said Ted. “With Snape’s track record I suppose"
9019,we should just be glad they’re still alive.”
9020,"“You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?” asked Dirk. “You"
9021,believe Snape killed Dumbledore?”
9022,"“ ’Course I do,” said Ted. “You’re not going to sit there and tell"
9023,me you think Potter had anything to do with it?”
9024,"“Hard to know what to believe these days,” muttered Dirk."
9025,"“I know Harry Potter,” said Dean. “And I reckon he’s the real"
9026,"thing — the Chosen One, or whatever you want to call it.”"
9027,"“Yeah, there’s a lot would like to believe he’s that, son,” said Dirk,"
9028,"“me included. But where is he? Run for it, by the looks of things."
9029,"You’d think, if he knew anything we don’t, or had anything special"
9030,"going for him, he’d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance,"
9031,"instead of hiding. And you know, the Prophet made a pretty good"
9032,case against him —”
9033,“The Prophet?” scoffed Ted. “You deserve to be lied to if you’re still
9034,"reading that muck, Dirk. You want the facts, try the Quibbler.”"
9035,"There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a"
9036,"good deal of thumping; by the sound of it, Dirk had swallowed a"
9037,"fish bone. At last he spluttered, “The Quibbler? That lunatic rag of"
9038,Xeno Lovegood’s?”
9039,"“It’s not so lunatic these days,” said Ted. “You want to give it"
9040,"a look. Xeno is printing all the stuff the Prophet’s ignoring, not"
9041,a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue.
9042,"How long they’ll let him get away with it, mind, I don’t know. But"
9043, 299   
9044,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9045,"Xeno says, front page of every issue, that any wizard who’s against"
9046,You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-
9047,one priority.”
9048,"“Hard to help a boy who’s vanished off the face of the earth,”"
9049,said Dirk.
9050,"“Listen, the fact that they haven’t caught him yet’s one hell of"
9051,"an achievement,” said Ted. “I’d take tips from him gladly; it’s what"
9052,"we’re trying to do, stay free, isn’t it?”"
9053,"“Yeah, well, you’ve got a point there,” said Dirk heavily. “With"
9054,the whole of the Ministry and all their informers looking for him
9055,"I’d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who’s to say they"
9056,haven’t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?”
9057,"“Ah, don’t say that, Dirk,” murmured Ted."
9058,There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and
9059,forks. When they spoke again it was to discuss whether they ought
9060,to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. Deciding
9061,"the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then"
9062,"clambered back up the incline, their voices fading away."
9063,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry,"
9064,who had found the need to remain silent increasingly difficult the
9065,"longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say more"
9066,"than, “Ginny — the sword —”"
9067,“I know!” said Hermione.
9068,"She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in"
9069,it right up to the armpit.
9070,"“Here . . . we . . . are . . .” she said between gritted teeth, and she"
9071,pulled at something that was evidently in the depths of the bag.
9072,Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight. Harry
9073,hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas

9076,"Nigellus free of Hermione’s bag, she kept her wand pointing at it,"
9077,ready to cast a spell at any moment.
9078,“If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was
9079,"in Dumbledore’s office,” she panted, as they propped the painting"
9080,"against the side of the tent, “Phineas Nigellus would have seen it"
9081,"happen, he hangs right beside the case!”"
9082,"“Unless he was asleep,” said Harry, but he still held his breath"
9083,"as Hermione knelt down in front of the empty canvas, her wand"
9084,"directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said:"
9085,“Er — Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?”
9086,Nothing happened.
9087,“Phineas Nigellus?” said Hermione again. “Professor Black? Please
9088,could we talk to you? Please?”
9089,"“ ‘Please’ always helps,” said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Ni-"
9090,"gellus slid into his portrait. At once, Hermione cried:"
9091,“Obscuro!”
9092,"A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus’s clever, dark"
9093,"eyes, causing him to bump into the frame and shriek with pain."
9094,“What — how dare — what are you — ?”
9095,"“I’m very sorry, Professor Black,” said Hermione, “but it’s a nec-"

9098,ining a great work of art! Where am I? What is going on?”
9099,"“Never mind where we are,” said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus"

9101,“Can that possibly be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?”
9102,"“Maybe,” said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Ni-"
9103,gellus’s interest. “We’ve got a couple of questions to ask you — about
9104,the sword of Gryffindor.”

9106,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9107,"“Ah,” said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and"
9108,"that in an effort to catch sight of Harry, “yes. That silly girl acted"
9109,most unwisely there —”
9110,"“Shut up about my sister,” said Ron roughly. Phineas Nigellus"
9111,raised supercilious eyebrows.
9112,"“Who else is here?” he asked, turning his head from side to side."
9113,“Your tone displeases me! The girl and her friends were foolhardy
9114,in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster!”
9115,"“They weren’t thieving,” said Harry. “That sword isn’t Snape’s.”"
9116,"“It belongs to Professor Snape’s school,” said Phineas Nigellus."
9117,“Exactly what claim did the Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved
9118,"her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the Lovegood"
9119,oddity!”
9120,“Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!” said
9121,Hermione.
9122,"“Where am I?” repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with"
9123,the blindfold again. “Where have you brought me? Why have you
9124,removed me from the house of my forebears?”
9125,"“Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and"
9126,Luna?” asked Harry urgently.
9127,"“Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some"
9128,"work for the oaf, Hagrid.”"
9129,“Hagrid’s not an oaf!” said Hermione shrilly.
9130,"“And Snape might’ve thought that was a punishment,” said"
9131,"Harry, “but Ginny, Neville, and Luna probably had a good laugh"
9132,with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest . . . they’ve faced plenty worse
9133,"than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!”"
9134,"He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus"
9135,Curse at the very least.

9138,"“What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether"
9139,"anyone else has, um, taken out the sword at all? Maybe it’s been"
9140,taken away for cleaning or — or something?”
9141,Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes
9142,and sniggered.
9143,"“Muggle-borns,” he said. “Goblin-made armor does not require"
9144,"cleaning, simple girl. Goblins’ silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing"
9145,only that which strengthens it.”
9146,"“Don’t call Hermione simple,” said Harry."
9147,"“I grow weary of contradiction,” said Phineas Nigellus. “Perhaps"
9148,it is time for me to return to the headmaster’s office?”
9149,"Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying"
9150,to feel his way out of his picture and back into the one at Hogwarts.
9151,Harry had a sudden inspiration.
9152,“Dumbledore! Can’t you bring us Dumbledore?”
9153,“I beg your pardon?” asked Phineas Nigellus.
9154,“Professor Dumbledore’s portrait — couldn’t you bring him
9155,"along, here, into yours?”"
9156,Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry’s
9157,voice.
9158,"“Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter."
9159,"The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other, but they"
9160,cannot travel outside the castle except to visit a painting of them-
9161,"selves hanging elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me,"
9162,"and after the treatment I have received at your hands, I can assure"
9163,you that I shall not be making a return visit!”
9164,"Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts"
9165,to leave his frame.
9166,"“Professor Black,” said Hermione, “couldn’t you just tell us, please,"
9167, 303  
9168,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9169,when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case? Before
9170,"Ginny took it out, I mean?”"
9171,Phineas snorted impatiently.
9172,“I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave
9173,its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a
9174,ring.”
9175,Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them
9176,"dared say more in front of Phineas Nigellus, who had at last man-"
9177,aged to locate the exit.
9178,"“Well, good night to you,” he said a little waspishly, and he began"
9179,to move out of sight again. Only the edge of his hat brim remained
9180,in view when Harry gave a sudden shout.
9181,“Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?”
9182,Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the
9183,picture.
9184,“Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the
9185,"many eccentricities of Albus Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!”"
9186,"And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him noth-"
9187,ing but his murky backdrop.
9188,“Harry!” Hermione cried.
9189,"“I know!” Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched"
9190,the air; it was more than he had dared to hope for. He strode up and
9191,"down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did not even"
9192,feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing Phineas Nigellus’s
9193,portrait back into the beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp
9194,she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to Harry.
9195,“The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe

9200,"“And Dumbledore didn’t give it to me because he still needed it,"
9201,he wanted to use it on the locket —”
9202,“— and he must have realized they wouldn’t let you have it if he
9203,put it in his will —”
9204,“— so he made a copy —”
9205,“— and put a fake in the glass case —”
9206,“— and he left the real one — where?”
9207,They gazed at each other; Harry felt that the answer was dangling
9208,"invisibly in the air above them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn’t Dum-"
9209,"bledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but Harry had not"
9210,realized it at the time?
9211,“Think!” whispered Hermione. “Think! Where would he have
9212,left it?”
9213,"“Not at Hogwarts,” said Harry, resuming his pacing."
9214,“Somewhere in Hogsmeade?” suggested Hermione.
9215,“The Shrieking Shack?” said Harry. “Nobody ever goes in
9216,there.”
9217,"“But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn’t that be a bit risky?”"
9218,"“Dumbledore trusted Snape,” Harry reminded her."
9219,"“Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,” said"
9220,Hermione.
9221,"“Yeah, you’re right!” said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at"
9222,"the thought that Dumbledore had had some reservations, however"
9223,"faint, about Snape’s trustworthiness. “So, would he have hidden"
9224,"the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d’you reckon,"
9225,Ron? Ron?”
9226,Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought
9227,"that Ron had left the tent, then realized that Ron was lying in the"
9228,"shadow of a lower bunk, looking stony."
9229,  305   
9230,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
9231,"“Oh, remembered me, have you?” he said."
9232,“What?”
9233,Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper
9234,bunk.
9235,“You two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.”
9236,"Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook"
9237,"her head, apparently as nonplussed as he was."
9238,“What’s the problem?” asked Harry.
9239,"“Problem? There’s no problem,” said Ron, still refusing to look at"
9240,"Harry. “Not according to you, anyway.”"
9241,There were several plunks on the canvas over their heads. It had
9242,started to rain.
9243,"“Well, you’ve obviously got a problem,” said Harry. “Spit it out,"
9244,will you?”
9245,"Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean,"
9246,unlike himself.
9247,"“All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down"
9248,the tent because there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find.
9249,Just add it to the list of stuff you don’t know.”
9250,"“I don’t know?” repeated Harry, “I don’t know?”"
9251,"Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier;"
9252,it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the
9253,river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry’s jubilation:
9254,Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to
9255,be thinking.
9256,"“It’s not like I’m not having the time of my life here,” said Ron,"
9257,"“you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing"
9258,"my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we’d been"
9259,"running round a few weeks, we’d have achieved something.”"
9260, 306  
9261,THE GOBLIN’S REVENGE
9262,"“Ron,” Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could"
9263,pretend not to have heard it over the loud tattoo the rain was now
9264,beating on the tent.
9265,"“I thought you knew what you’d signed up for,” said Harry."
9266,"“Yeah, I thought I did too.”"
9267,“So what part of it isn’t living up to your expectations?” asked
9268,Harry. Anger was coming to his defense now. “Did you think we’d
9269,be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other day?
9270,Did you think you’d be back to Mummy by Christmas?”
9271,"“We thought you knew what you were doing!” shouted Ron,"
9272,"standing up, and his words pierced Harry like scalding knives. “We"
9273,"thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had"
9274,a real plan!”
9275,"“Ron!” said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain"
9276,"thundering on the tent roof, but again, he ignored her."
9277,"“Well, sorry to let you down,” said Harry, his voice quite calm"
9278,"even though he felt hollow, inadequate. “I’ve been straight with you"
9279,"from the start, I told you everything Dumbledore told me. And in"
9280,"case you haven’t noticed, we’ve found one Horcrux —”"
9281,"“Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding"
9282,"the rest of them — nowhere effing near, in other words!”"
9283,"“Take off the locket, Ron,” Hermione said, her voice unusually"
9284,high. “Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like this if you
9285,hadn’t been wearing it all day.”
9286,"“Yeah, he would,” said Harry, who did not want excuses made"
9287,for Ron. “D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you whispering
9288,behind my back? D’you think I didn’t guess you were thinking this
9289,stuff?”
9290,"“Harry, we weren’t —”"

9294,"disappointed, you said you’d thought he had a bit more to go on"
9295,than —”
9296,"“I didn’t say it like that — Harry, I didn’t!” she cried."
9297,"The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermi-"

9299,"as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared and"

9302,"in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be dead."
9303,“So why are you still here?” Harry asked Ron.
9304,"“Search me,” said Ron."
9305,"“Go home then,” said Harry."
9306,"“Yeah, maybe I will!” shouted Ron, and he took several steps"
9307,"toward Harry, who did not back away. “Didn’t you hear what they"
9308,"said about my sister? But you don’t give a rat’s fart, do you, it’s only"

9338,"“Protego!” she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between"
9339,her and Harry on the one side and Ron on the other; all of them
9340,"were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, and"
9341,Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as
9342,though they were seeing each other clearly for the first time. Harry
9343,felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron: Something had broken between
9344,them.
9345,"“Leave the Horcrux,” Harry said."
9346,Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket
9347,into a nearby chair. He turned to Hermione.
9348,“What are you doing?”
9349,“What do you mean?”
9350,"“Are you staying, or what?”"
9351,"“I . . .” She looked anguished. “Yes — yes, I’m staying. Ron, we"

9356,"“Ron, no — please — come back, come back!”"
9357,She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she
9358,had removed it he had already stormed into the night. Harry stood
9359,"quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron’s name"
9360,amongst the trees.
9361,"After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to"
9362,her face.
9363,“He’s g-g-gone! Disapparated!”
9364,"She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry."
9365,"Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed"
9366,it around his own neck. He dragged blankets off Ron’s bunk and
9367,threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own bed
9368,"and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of"
9369,the rain.

9373,W           hen Harry woke the following day it was several sec-
9374,onds before he remembered what had happened. Then
9375,"he hoped, childishly, that it had been a dream, that Ron was still"
9376,there and had never left. Yet by turning his head on his pillow he
9377,could see Ron’s deserted bunk. It was like a dead body in the way
9378,"it seemed to draw his eyes. Harry jumped down from his own bed,"
9379,"keeping his eyes averted from Ron’s. Hermione, who was already"
9380,"busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but turned"
9381,her face away quickly as he went by.
9382,"He’s gone, Harry told himself. He’s gone. He had to keep think-"
9383,"ing it as he washed and dressed, as though repetition would dull"
9384,the shock of it. He’s gone and he’s not coming back. And that was the
9385,"simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchant-"
9386,"ments meant that it would be impossible, once they vacated this"
9387,"spot, for Ron to find them again."
9388,He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione’s eyes were
9389,  311    
9390,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9391,puffy and red; she looked as if she had not slept. They packed up
9392,"their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why she wanted to"
9393,spin out their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look
9394,"up eagerly, and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking"
9395,"that she heard footsteps through the heavy rain, but no red-haired"
9396,"figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her,"
9397,"looked around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and"
9398,"saw nothing but rain-swept woods, another little parcel of fury"
9399,"exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, “We thought you"
9400,"knew what you were doing!”, and he resumed packing with a hard"
9401,knot in the pit of his stomach.
9402,The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon
9403,spill over onto their bank. They had lingered a good hour after they
9404,would usually have departed their campsite. Finally having entirely
9405,"repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable"
9406,to find any more reasons to delay: She and Harry grasped hands
9407,"and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept heather-covered"
9408,hillside.
9409,"The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry’s hand and"
9410,"walked away from him, finally sitting down on a large rock, her face"
9411,"on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He watched"
9412,"her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something"
9413,kept him rooted to the spot. Everything inside him felt cold and
9414,tight: Again he saw the contemptuous expression on Ron’s face.
9415,"Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with"
9416,"the distraught Hermione at its center, casting the spells she usually"
9417,performed to ensure their protection.
9418,They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was
9419,"determined never to mention his name again, and Hermione seemed"
9420, 312  
9421,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9422,"to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although sometimes at"
9423,"night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying."
9424,Meanwhile Harry had started bringing out the Marauder’s Map and
9425,examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for the moment when
9426,"Ron’s labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts,"
9427,"proving that he had returned to the comfortable castle, protected"
9428,"by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not appear on the"
9429,"map, and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to"
9430,"stare at Ginny’s name in the girls’ dormitory, wondering whether"
9431,"the intensity with which he gazed at it might break into her sleep,"
9432,"that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping"
9433,that she was all right.
9434,"By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the pos-"
9435,"sible locations of Gryffindor’s sword, but the more they talked about"
9436,"the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the more des-"
9437,perate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains
9438,"though he might, Harry could not remember Dumbledore ever"
9439,mentioning a place in which he might hide something. There were
9440,moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron
9441,or with Dumbledore. We thought you knew what you were doing. . . .
9442,We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do. . . . We thought you
9443,had a real plan!
9444,He could not hide it from himself: Ron had been right. Dumble-
9445,dore had left him with virtually nothing. They had discovered one
9446,"Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it: The others were"
9447,as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to
9448,engulf him. He was staggered now to think of his own presumption
9449,in accepting his friends’ offers to accompany him on this meander-
9450,"ing, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and he"
9451,  313  

9453,"was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indication that Her-"
9454,"mione too was about to tell him that she had had enough, that she"
9455,was leaving.
9456,"They were spending many evenings in near silence, and Hermi-"
9457,one took to bringing out Phineas Nigellus’s portrait and propping
9458,"it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left"
9459,by Ron’s departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would
9460,"never visit them again, Phineas Nigellus did not seem able to re-"
9461,"sist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to, and"
9462,"consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was"
9463,"even glad to see him, because he was company, albeit of a snide and"
9464,taunting kind. They relished any news about what was happening at
9465,"Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He"
9466,"venerated Snape, the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had"
9467,"controlled the school, and they had to be careful not to criticize or"
9468,"ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would"
9469,instantly leave his painting.
9470,"However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be"
9471,"facing a constant, low level of mutiny from a hard core of students."
9472,Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape had
9473,reinstated Umbridge’s old decree forbidding gatherings of three or
9474,more students or any unofficial student societies.
9475,"From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and prob-"
9476,"ably Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to"
9477,continue Dumbledore’s Army. This scant news made Harry want
9478,to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made
9479,"him think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts"
9480,"itself, which he missed nearly as much as his ex-girlfriend. Indeed,"
9481,"as Phineas Nigellus talked about Snape’s crackdown, Harry expe-"
9482, 314  
9483,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9484,rienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going
9485,back to school to join the destabilization of Snape’s regime: Be-
9486,"ing fed, and having a soft bed, and other people being in charge,"
9487,seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at that moment.
9488,"But then he remembered that he was Undesirable Number One,"
9489,"that there was a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head, and that"
9490,to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking
9491,"into the Ministry of Magic. Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently"
9492,emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about Harry
9493,and Hermione’s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside
9494,"the beaded bag every time he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invari-"
9495,ably refused to reappear for several days after these unceremonious

9497,The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in
9498,"any one area too long, so rather than staying in the south of Eng-"
9499,"land, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they"
9500,"continued to meander up and down the country, braving a moun-"
9501,"tainside, where sleet pounded the tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the"
9502,tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle of
9503,"a Scottish loch, where snow half buried the tent in the night."
9504,They had already spotted Christmas trees twinkling from several
9505,sitting room windows before there came an evening when Harry
9506,"resolved to suggest, again, what seemed to him the only unexplored"
9507,avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal:
9508,Hermione had been to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak
9509,"(scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as she left), and"
9510,Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a
9511,stomach full of spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. He had also
9512,had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours’ break from
9513, 315   
9514,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9515,"wearing the Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk"
9516,beside him.
9517,“Hermione?”
9518,“Hmm?” She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with
9519,The Tales of Beedle the Bard. He could not imagine how much more
9520,"she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very long;"
9521,"but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because"
9522,Spellman’s Syllabary lay open on the arm of the chair.
9523,Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the
9524,"occasion, several years previously, when he had asked Professor Mc-"
9525,"Gonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, despite the fact that"
9526,he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip.
9527,"“Hermione, I’ve been thinking, and —”"
9528,"“Harry, could you help me with something?”"
9529,Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned
9530,forward and held out The Tales of Beedle the Bard.
9531,"“Look at that symbol,” she said, pointing to the top of a page."
9532,Above what Harry assumed was the title of the story (being unable
9533,"to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what"
9534,"looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line."
9535,"“I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.”"
9536,"“I know that, but it isn’t a rune and it’s not in the syllabary, either."
9537,"All along I thought it was a picture of an eye, but I don’t think it"
9538,"is! It’s been inked in, look, somebody’s drawn it there, it isn’t really"
9539,"part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?”"
9540,"“No . . . No, wait a moment.” Harry looked closer. “Isn’t it the"
9541,same symbol Luna’s dad was wearing round his neck?”
9542,"“Well, that’s what I thought too!”"
9543,“Then it’s Grindelwald’s mark.”
9544, 316 
9545,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9546,"She stared at him, openmouthed."
9547,“What?”
9548,“Krum told me . . .”
9549,He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the
9550,wedding. Hermione looked astonished.
9551,“Grindelwald’s mark?”
9552,She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. “I’ve
9553,never heard that Grindelwald had a mark. There’s no mention of it
9554,in anything I’ve ever read about him.”
9555,"“Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a"
9556,"wall at Durmstrang, and Grindelwald put it there.”"
9557,"She fell back into the old armchair, frowning."
9558,"“That’s very odd. If it’s a symbol of Dark Magic, what’s it doing"
9559,in a book of children’s stories?”
9560,"“Yeah, it is weird,” said Harry. “And you’d think Scrimgeour"
9561,"would have recognized it. He was Minister, he ought to have been"
9562,expert on Dark stuff.”
9563,"“I know. . . . Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All"
9564,the other stories have little pictures over the titles.”
9565,"She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark."
9566,Harry tried again.
9567,“Hermione?”
9568,“Hmm?”
9569,“I’ve been thinking. I — I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.”
9570,"She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he"
9571,was sure she was still thinking about the mysterious mark on the
9572,book.
9573,"“Yes,” she said. “Yes, I’ve been wondering that too. I really think"
9574,we’ll have to.”
9575, 317   
9576,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9577,“Did you hear me right?” he asked.
9578,"“Of course I did. You want to go to Godric’s Hollow. I agree, I"
9579,"think we should. I mean, I can’t think of anywhere else it could be"
9580,"either. It’ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more"
9581,likely it seems it’s there.”
9582,“Er — what’s there?” asked Harry.
9583,"At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt."
9584,"“Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you’d"
9585,"want to go back there, and I mean, Godric’s Hollow is Godric"
9586,Gryffindor’s birthplace —”
9587,“Really? Gryffindor came from Godric’s Hollow?”
9588,"“Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?”"
9589,"“Erm,” he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months:"
9590,"The muscles in his face felt oddly stiff. “I might’ve opened it, you"
9591,"know, when I bought it . . . just the once. . . .”"
9592,"“Well, as the village is named after him I’d have thought you"
9593,"might have made the connection,” said Hermione. She sounded"
9594,much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half
9595,expected her to announce that she was off to the library. “There’s a
9596,"bit about the village in A History of Magic, wait . . .”"
9597,"She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally"
9598,"extracting her copy of their old school textbook, A History of Magic"
9599,"by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through until finding the"
9600,page she wanted.
9601,"“ ‘Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689,"
9602,"wizards went into hiding for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they"
9603,formed their own small communities within a community. Many small
9604,"villages and hamlets attracted several magical families, who banded"
9605,together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworth
9606, 318   
9607,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9608,"in Cornwall, Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on"
9609,the south coast of England were notable homes to knots of Wizarding
9610,families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded Mug-
9611,"gles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps,"
9612,"Godric’s Hollow, the West Country village where the great wizard"
9613,"Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman Wright, Wizard-"
9614,"ing smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the"
9615,"names of ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for"
9616,the stories of hauntings that have dogged the little church beside it for
9617,many centuries.’
9618,"“You and your parents aren’t mentioned,” Hermione said, closing"
9619,"the book, “because Professor Bagshot doesn’t cover anything later"
9620,than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric’s Hol-
9621,"low, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor’s sword; don’t you think Dum-"
9622,bledore would have expected you to make the connection?”
9623,“Oh yeah . . .”
9624,Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking
9625,about the sword at all when he suggested they go to Godric’s Hol-
9626,"low. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents’ graves, the"
9627,"house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of"
9628,Bathilda Bagshot.
9629,“Remember what Muriel said?” he asked eventually.
9630,“Who?”
9631,"“You know,” he hesitated: He did not want to say Ron’s name."
9632,“Ginny’s great-aunt. At the wedding. The one who said you had
9633,skinny ankles.”
9634,"“Oh,” said Hermione. It was a sticky moment: Harry knew that"
9635,she had sensed Ron’s name in the offing. He rushed on:
9636,“She said Bathilda Bagshot still lives in Godric’s Hollow.”
9637, 319  
9638,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9639,"“Bathilda Bagshot,” murmured Hermione, running her index"
9640,finger over Bathilda’s embossed name on the front cover of A His-
9641,"tory of Magic. “Well, I suppose —”"
9642,She gasped so dramatically that Harry’s insides turned over; he
9643,"drew his wand, looking around at the entrance, half expecting to"
9644,"see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there was"
9645,nothing there.
9646,"“What?” he said, half angry, half relieved. “What did you do"
9647,"that for? I thought you’d seen a Death Eater unzipping the tent, at"
9648,least —”
9649,"“Harry, what if Bathilda’s got the sword? What if Dumbledore"
9650,entrusted it to her?”
9651,Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely
9652,"old woman by now, and according to Muriel, she was “gaga.” Was it"
9653,likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword of Gryffindor
9654,"with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to"
9655,chance: Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the
9656,"sword with a fake, nor had he so much as mentioned a friendship"
9657,"with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt"
9658,"on Hermione’s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to"
9659,fall in with Harry’s dearest wish.
9660,"“Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric’s"
9661,Hollow?”
9662,"“Yes, but we’ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.” She"
9663,"was sitting up now, and Harry could tell that the prospect of hav-"
9664,ing a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. “We’ll need to
9665,practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a
9666,"start, and perhaps Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too,"
9667,unless you think we should go the whole hog and use Polyjuice
9668, 320   
9669,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9670,Potion? In that case we’ll need to collect hair from somebody. I
9671,"actually think we’d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises"
9672,the better. . . .”
9673,"Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was"
9674,"a pause, but his mind had left the conversation. For the first time"
9675,"since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he"
9676,felt excited.
9677,"He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he"
9678,"had had a family. It was in Godric’s Hollow that, but for Voldemort,"
9679,he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. He could
9680,have invited friends to his house. . . . He might even have had broth-
9681,ers and sisters. . . . It would have been his mother who had made
9682,his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had hardly ever
9683,"seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about"
9684,to see the place where it had been taken from him. After Hermione
9685,"had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from"
9686,"Hermione’s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album"
9687,"Hagrid had given him so long ago. For the first time in months, he"
9688,"perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up at him"
9689,"from the images, which were all he had left of them now."
9690,Harry would gladly have set out for Godric’s Hollow the follow-
9691,"ing day, but Hermione had other ideas. Convinced as she was that"
9692,Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his parents’
9693,"deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had"
9694,ensured that they had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a
9695,full week later — once they had surreptitiously obtained hairs from
9696,"innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had prac-"
9697,ticed Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility
9698,Cloak together — that Hermione agreed to make the journey.
9699, 321    
9700,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9701,"They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness,"
9702,so it was late afternoon when they finally swallowed Polyjuice Po-
9703,"tion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle man,"
9704,Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag
9705,"containing all of their possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which"
9706,Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into an inside
9707,pocket of Hermione’s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invis-
9708,"ibility Cloak over them, then they turned into the suffocating dark-"
9709,ness once again.
9710,"Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were"
9711,"standing hand in hand in a snowy lane under a dark blue sky, in"
9712,which the night’s first stars were already glimmering feebly. Cot-
9713,"tages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations"
9714,"twinkling in their windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of"
9715,golden streetlights indicated the center of the village.
9716,“All this snow!” Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. “Why
9717,"didn’t we think of snow? After all our precautions, we’ll leave prints!"
9718,"We’ll just have to get rid of them — you go in front, I’ll do it —”"
9719,"Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse,"
9720,trying to keep themselves concealed while magically covering their
9721,traces.
9722,"“Let’s take off the Cloak,” said Harry, and when she looked"
9723,"frightened, “Oh, come on, we don’t look like us and there’s no one"
9724,around.”
9725,He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way
9726,"forward unhampered, the icy air stinging their faces as they passed"
9727,more cottages: Any one of them might have been the one in which
9728,James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry
9729,"gazed at the front doors, their snow-burdened roofs, and their front"
9730, 322  
9731,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9732,"porches, wondering whether he remembered any of them, knowing"
9733,"deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than"
9734,a year old when he had left this place forever. He was not even sure
9735,whether he would be able to see the cottage at all; he did not know
9736,what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then
9737,the little lane along which they were walking curved to the left and
9738,"the heart of the village, a small square, was revealed to them."
9739,"Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like"
9740,"a war memorial in the middle, partly obscured by a windblown"
9741,"Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and a"
9742,little church whose stained-glass windows were glowing jewel-bright
9743,across the square.
9744,The snow here had become impacted: It was hard and slippery
9745,where people had trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing
9746,"in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated by streetlamps."
9747,They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door
9748,opened and closed; then they heard a carol start up inside the little
9749,church.
9750,"“Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve!” said Hermione."
9751,“Is it?”
9752,He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for
9753,weeks.
9754,"“I’m sure it is,” said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. “They"
9755,". . . they’ll be in there, won’t they? Your mum and dad? I can see"
9756,the graveyard behind it.”
9757,"Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement,"
9758,"more like fear. Now that he was so near, he wondered whether he"
9759,wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feel-
9760,"ing, because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first"
9761,  323  
9762,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9763,"time, pulling him forward. Halfway across the square, however, she"
9764,stopped dead.
9765,"“Harry, look!”"
9766,"She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it,"
9767,"it had transformed. Instead of an obelisk covered in names, there"
9768,"was a statue of three people: a man with untidy hair and glasses, a"
9769,"woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sit-"
9770,"ting in his mother’s arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy"
9771,white caps.
9772,"Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents’ faces. He had never"
9773,imagined that there would be a statue. . . . How strange it was to
9774,"see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on"
9775,his forehead. . . .
9776,"“C’mon,” said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned"
9777,"again toward the church. As they crossed the road, he glanced over"
9778,his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war memorial.
9779,The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made
9780,"Harry’s throat constrict, it reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts,"
9781,of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside suits of ar-
9782,"mor, of the Great Hall’s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore"
9783,"wearing a bonnet he had won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted"
9784,sweater. . . .
9785,There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermi-
9786,one pushed it open as quietly as possible and they edged through
9787,"it. On either side of the slippery path to the church doors, the snow"
9788,"lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carv-"
9789,"ing deep trenches behind them as they walked around the building,"
9790,keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant windows.
9791,"Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones pro-"
9792,  324  
9793,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9794,truded from a blanket of pale blue that was flecked with dazzling
9795,"red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass"
9796,hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his
9797,"jacket pocket, Harry moved toward the nearest grave."
9798,"“Look at this, it’s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of"
9799,Hannah’s!”
9800,"“Keep your voice down,” Hermione begged him."
9801,"They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark"
9802,"tracks into the snow behind them, stooping to peer at the words on"
9803,"old headstones, every now and then squinting into the surrounding"
9804,darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.
9805,"“Harry, here!”"
9806,Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back
9807,"to her, his heart positively banging in his chest."
9808,“Is it — ?”
9809,"“No, but look!”"
9810,"She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw,"
9811,"upon the frozen, lichen-spotted granite, the words Kendra Dum-"
9812,"bledore and, a short way below her dates of birth and death, and"
9813,Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation:
9814,"Where your treasure is, there willyour heart be also."
9815,So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right.
9816,"The Dumbledore family had indeed lived here, and part of it had"
9817,died here.
9818,Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not
9819,help thinking that he and Dumbledore both had deep roots in this
9820,"graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, yet he"
9821, 325   
9822,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9823,had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited
9824,the place together; for a moment Harry imagined coming here with
9825,"Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of how much it"
9826,"would have meant to him. But it seemed that to Dumbledore, the"
9827,fact that their families lay side by side in the same graveyard had
9828,"been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, perhaps, to the job he"
9829,wanted Harry to do.
9830,"Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was"
9831,hidden in shadow. He read the words on the tombstone again. Where
9832,"your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not understand"
9833,"what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as"
9834,the eldest member of the family once his mother had died.
9835,“Are you sure he never mentioned — ?” Hermione began.
9836,"“No,” said Harry curtly, then, “let’s keep looking,” and he turned"
9837,"away, wishing he had not seen the stone: He did not want his excited"
9838,trepidation tainted with resentment.
9839,“Here!” cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of
9840,"the darkness. “Oh no, sorry! I thought it said Potter.”"
9841,"She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it,"
9842,a little frown on her face.
9843,"“Harry, come back a moment.”"
9844,"He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly"
9845,made his way back through the snow toward her.
9846,“What?”
9847,“Look at this!”
9848,"The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could"
9849,hardly make out the name. Hermione showed him the symbol be-
9850,neath it.
9851,"“Harry, that’s the mark in the book!”"
9852,  326  
9853,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9854,He peered at the place she indicated: The stone was so worn that
9855,"it was hard to make out what was engraved there, though there did"
9856,seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible name.
9857,“Yeah . . . it could be. . . .”
9858,Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the
9859,headstone.
9860,"“It says Ig — Ignotus, I think. . . .”"
9861,"“I’m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?” Harry"
9862,"told her, a slight edge to his voice, and he set off again, leaving her"
9863,crouched beside the old grave.
9864,"Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott,"
9865,he had met at Hogwarts. Sometimes there were several generations
9866,of the same Wizarding family represented in the graveyard: Harry
9867,"could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the cur-"
9868,rent members had moved away from Godric’s Hollow. Deeper and
9869,"deeper amongst the graves he went, and every time he reached a new"
9870,headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation.
9871,"The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden,"
9872,"much deeper. Harry looked around, worried, thinking of demen-"
9873,"tors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter"
9874,and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way
9875,back into the square. Somebody inside the church had just turned
9876,off the lights.
9877,Then Hermione’s voice came out of the blackness for the third
9878,"time, sharp and clear from a few yards away."
9879,"“Harry, they’re here . . . right here.”"
9880,And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this
9881,"time: He moved toward her, feeling as if something heavy were"
9882,"pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after"
9883, 327 
9884,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
9885,"Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his"
9886,heart and lungs.
9887,The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana’s.
9888,"It was made of white marble, just like Dumbledore’s tomb, and this"

9895,The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
9896,"Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only"
9897,"one chance to take in their meaning, and he read the last of them"
9898,aloud.
9899,“ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death’. . .” A horrible
9900,"thought came to him, and with it a kind of panic. “Isn’t that a Death"
9901,Eater idea? Why is that there?”
9902,“It doesn’t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters
9903,"mean it, Harry,” said Hermione, her voice gentle. “It means . . . you"
9904,know . . . living beyond death. Living after death.”
9905,"But they were not living, thought Harry: They were gone. The"
9906,empty words could not disguise the fact that his parents’ moldering
9907,"remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. And"
9908,"tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly"
9909,"freezing on his face, and what was the point in wiping them off or"
9910,"pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, looking"
9911, 328    
9912,GODRIC’S HOLLOW
9913,down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the
9914,"last of Lily and James lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing"
9915,"or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart still beating,"
9916,"alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment,"
9917,that he was sleeping under the snow with them.
9918,Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly.
9919,"He could not look at her, but returned the pressure, now taking"
9920,"deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying"
9921,"to regain control. He should have brought something to give them,"
9922,"and he had not thought of it, and every plant in the graveyard was"
9923,"leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it in a"
9924,"circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed"
9925,before them. Harry caught it and laid it on his parents’ grave.
9926,As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave: He did not think he
9927,could stand another moment there. He put his arm around Hermi-
9928,"one’s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they turned"
9929,"in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore’s"
9930,"mother and sister, back toward the dark church and the out-of-sight"
9931,kissing gate.

9935,"H         arry, stop.”"
9936,“What’s wrong?”
9937,They had only just reached the grave of the unknown Abbott.
9938,"“There’s someone there. Someone watching us. I can tell. There,"
9939,over by the bushes.”
9940,"They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense"
9941,black boundary of the graveyard. Harry could not see anything.
9942,“Are you sure?”
9943,"“I saw something move, I could have sworn I did. . . .”"
9944,She broke from him to free her wand arm.
9945,"“We look like Muggles,” Harry pointed out."
9946,“Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave!
9947,"Harry, I’m sure there’s someone over there!”"
9948,Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed
9949,to be haunted: what if — ? But then he heard a rustle and saw a
9950, 330  
9951,BATHILDA’S SECRET
9952,little eddy of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione had
9953,pointed. Ghosts could not move snow.
9954,"“It’s a cat,” said Harry, after a second or two, “or a bird. If it was"
9955,"a Death Eater we’d be dead by now. But let’s get out of here, and"
9956,we can put the Cloak back on.”
9957,They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the
9958,"graveyard. Harry, who did not feel as sanguine as he had pretended"
9959,"when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate and the slip-"
9960,pery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over them-
9961,selves. The pub was fuller than before: Many voices inside it were
9962,now singing the carol that they had heard as they approached the
9963,church. For a moment Harry considered suggesting they take refuge
9964,"inside it, but before he could say anything Hermione murmured,"
9965,"“Let’s go this way,” and pulled him down the dark street leading out"
9966,of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered.
9967,Harry could make out the point where the cottages ended and the
9968,lane turned into open country again. They walked as quickly as they
9969,"dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the"
9970,outlines of Christmas trees dark through the curtains.
9971,"“How are we going to find Bathilda’s house?” asked Hermione,"
9972,who was shivering a little and kept glancing back over her shoulder.
9973,“Harry? What do you think? Harry?”
9974,"She tugged at his arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He"
9975,was looking toward the dark mass that stood at the very end of this
9976,"row of houses. Next moment he had sped up, dragging Hermione"
9977,along with him; she slipped a little on the ice.
9978,“Harry —”
9979,"“Look. . . . Look at it, Hermione. . . .”"
9980,  331   
9981,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
9982,“I don’t . . . oh!”
9983,He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James
9984,and Lily. The hedge had grown wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid
9985,had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst the
9986,"waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though"
9987,"entirely covered in dark ivy and snow, but the right side of the top"
9988,"floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where the"
9989,"curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up"
9990,at the wreck of what must once have been a cottage just like those
9991,that flanked it.
9992,“I wonder why nobody’s ever rebuilt it?” whispered Hermione.
9993,“Maybe you can’t rebuild it?” Harry replied. “Maybe it’s like the
9994,injuries from Dark Magic and you can’t repair the damage?”
9995,He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy
9996,"and thickly rusted gate, not wishing to open it, but simply to hold"
9997,some part of the house.
9998,"“You’re not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might — oh,"
9999,"Harry, look!”"
10000,His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen
10001,"out of the ground in front of them, up through the tangles of nettles"
10002,"and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in golden let-"
10003,ters upon the wood it said:
10004,"On this spot, on the night of 31 October 1981,"
10005,Lily and James Potter lost their lives.
10006,"Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard"
10007,ever to have survived the Killing Curse.
10008,"This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left"
10009,in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters
10010, 332  
10011,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10012,and as a reminder of the violence
10013,that tore apart their family.
10014,"And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been"
10015,added by other witches and wizards who had come to see the place
10016,where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely signed
10017,their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into
10018,"the wood, still others had left messages. The most recent of these,"
10019,"shining brightly over sixteen years’ worth of magical graffiti, all said"
10020,similar things.
10021,"Good luck, Harry, wherever you are."
10022,"If you read this, Harry, we’re all behind you!"
10023,Long live Harry Potter.
10024,"“They shouldn’t have written on the sign!” said Hermione,"
10025,indignant.
10026,But Harry beamed at her.
10027,“It’s brilliant. I’m glad they did. I . . .”
10028,He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane
10029,"toward them, silhouetted by the bright lights in the distant square."
10030,"Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a"
10031,"woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on"
10032,"the snowy ground. Her stoop, her stoutness, her shuffling gait all"
10033,gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as she
10034,drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into
10035,"any of the cottages she was passing, but he knew instinctively that"
10036,she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from them and
10037,"simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them."
10038, 333    
10039,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10040,He did not need Hermione’s pinch to his arm. There was next to
10041,no chance that this woman was a Muggle: She was standing there
10042,"gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to her,"
10043,"if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however,"
10044,"it was odd behavior to come out on a night this cold, simply to look"
10045,"at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, meanwhile, she"
10046,"ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless,"
10047,"Harry had the strangest feeling that she knew that they were there,"
10048,and also who they were. Just as he had reached this uneasy conclu-
10049,"sion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned."
10050,"Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed"
10051,against his.
10052,“How does she know?”
10053,"He shook his head. The woman beckoned again, more vigor-"
10054,ously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey the sum-
10055,"mons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing"
10056,stronger every moment that they stood facing each other in the
10057,deserted street.
10058,Was it possible that she had been waiting for them all these long
10059,"months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry"
10060,would come in the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had
10061,moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had followed them to this
10062,spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish
10063,power that he had never encountered before.
10064,"Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump."
10065,“Are you Bathilda?”
10066,The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again.
10067,Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other.
10068,"Harry raised his eyebrows; Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod."
10069, 334  
10070,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10071,"They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and"
10072,hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several
10073,"houses, she turned in at a gate. They followed her up the front path"
10074,through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just left.
10075,"She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened"
10076,it and stepped back to let them pass.
10077,"She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house: Harry wrinkled"
10078,his nose as they sidled past her and pulled off the Cloak. Now that
10079,"he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down with"
10080,"age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind"
10081,"them, her knuckles blue and mottled against the peeling paint, then"
10082,turned and peered into Harry’s face. Her eyes were thick with cata-
10083,"racts and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face"
10084,was dotted with broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether
10085,"she could make him out at all; even if she could, it was the balding"
10086,Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see.
10087,"The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food"
10088,"intensified as she unwound a moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a"
10089,head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed clearly.
10090,“Bathilda?” Harry repeated.
10091,She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his
10092,skin; the thing inside it that sometimes ticked or beat had woken;
10093,"he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, could"
10094,"it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near?"
10095,"Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing Hermione aside as though"
10096,"she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting"
10097,room.
10098,"“Harry, I’m not sure about this,” breathed Hermione."
10099,“Look at the size of her; I think we could overpower her if we had
10100, 335  
10101,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10102,"to,” said Harry. “Listen, I should have told you, I knew she wasn’t"
10103,all there. Muriel called her ‘gaga.’ ”
10104,“Come!” called Bathilda from the next room.
10105,Hermione jumped and clutched Harry’s arm.
10106,"“It’s okay,” said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the"
10107,sitting room.
10108,"Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but"
10109,"it was still very dark, not to mention extremely dirty. Thick dust"
10110,"crunched beneath their feet, and Harry’s nose detected, underneath"
10111,"the dank and mildewed smell, something worse, like meat gone"
10112,bad. He wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside
10113,Bathilda’s house to check whether she was coping. She seemed to
10114,"have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles"
10115,"clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catch-"
10116,ing fire.
10117,"“Let me do that,” offered Harry, and he took the matches from her."
10118,She stood watching him as he finished lighting the candle stubs that
10119,"stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously on stacks of"
10120,books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups.
10121,The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-
10122,fronted chest of drawers on which there stood a large number of
10123,"photographs. When the flame danced into life, its reflection wavered"
10124,on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from
10125,"the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered"
10126,"“Tergeo”: The dust vanished from the photographs, and he saw at"
10127,once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most or-
10128,nate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had
10129,removed them. Then the sight of a photograph near the back of the
10130,"collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up."
10131, 336   
10132,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10133,"It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who"
10134,"had perched on Gregorovitch’s windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry"
10135,out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where he had
10136,"seen the boy before: in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm"
10137,"in arm with the teenage Dumbledore, and that must be where all"
10138,the missing photographs were: in Rita’s book.
10139,"“Mrs. — Miss — Bagshot?” he said, and his voice shook slightly."
10140,“Who is this?”
10141,Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Her-
10142,mione light the fire for her.
10143,"“Miss Bagshot?” Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture"
10144,in his hands as the flames burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda
10145,"looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his chest."
10146,"“Who is this person?” Harry asked her, pushing the picture"
10147,forward.
10148,"She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry."
10149,“Do you know who this is?” he repeated in a much slower and
10150,louder voice than usual. “This man? Do you know him? What’s he
10151,called?”
10152,Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration.
10153,How had Rita Skeeter unlocked Bathilda’s memories?
10154,“Who is this man?” he repeated loudly.
10155,"“Harry, what are you doing?” asked Hermione."
10156,"“This picture, Hermione, it’s the thief, the thief who stole from"
10157,Gregorovitch! Please!” he said to Bathilda. “Who is this?”
10158,But she only stared at him.
10159,"“Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. — Miss — Bag-"
10160,"shot?” asked Hermione, raising her own voice. “Was there some-"
10161,thing you wanted to tell us?”
10162, 337  
10163,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10164,"Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuf-"
10165,fled a few steps closer to Harry. With a little jerk of her head she
10166,looked back into the hall.
10167,“You want us to leave?” he asked.
10168,"She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at"
10169,"herself, then at the ceiling."
10170,"“Oh, right . . . Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs"
10171,with her.”
10172,"“All right,” said Hermione, “let’s go.”"
10173,"But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with sur-"
10174,"prising vigor, once more pointing first at Harry, then to herself."
10175,"“She wants me to go with her, alone.”"
10176,"“Why?” asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear"
10177,in the candlelit room; the old lady shook her head a little at the
10178,loud noise.
10179,"“Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only"
10180,to me?”
10181,“Do you really think she knows who you are?”
10182,"“Yes,” said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon"
10183,"his own, “I think she does.”"
10184,"“Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry.”"
10185,"“Lead the way,” Harry told Bathilda."
10186,"She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him to-"
10187,ward the door. Harry glanced back at Hermione with a reassuring
10188,"smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging herself"
10189,"in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase."
10190,"As Harry walked out of the room, unseen by both Hermione and"
10191,"Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the unknown"
10192,thief inside his jacket.
10193,  338  
10194,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10195,The stairs were steep and narrow: Harry was half tempted to place
10196,his hands on stout Bathilda’s backside to ensure that she did not
10197,"topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too likely."
10198,"Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned"
10199,"immediately right, and led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom."
10200,It was pitch-black and smelled horrible: Harry had just made out
10201,a chamber pot protruding from under the bed before Bathilda closed
10202,the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness.
10203,"“Lumos,” said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start:"
10204,"Bathilda had moved close to him in those few seconds of darkness,"
10205,and he had not heard her approach.
10206,“You are Potter?” she whispered.
10207,"“Yes, I am.”"
10208,"She nodded slowly, solemnly. Harry felt the Horcrux beating"
10209,"fast, faster than his own heart: It was an unpleasant, agitating"
10210,sensation.
10211,"“Have you got anything for me?” Harry asked, but she seemed"
10212,distracted by his lit wand-tip.
10213,“Have you got anything for me?” he repeated.
10214,Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once:
10215,Harry’s scar prickled painfully; the Horcrux twitched so that the
10216,"front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved"
10217,"momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice:"
10218,Hold him!
10219,"Harry swayed where he stood: The dark, foul-smelling room"
10220,seemed to close around him again; he did not know what had just
10221,happened.
10222,"“Have you got anything for me?” he asked for a third time, much"
10223,louder.
10224, 339 
10225,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10226,"“Over here,” she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised"
10227,his wand and saw the outline of a cluttered dressing table beneath
10228,the curtained window.
10229,This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and
10230,"the unmade bed, his wand raised. He did not want to look away"
10231,from her.
10232,"“What is it?” he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was"
10233,heaped high with what looked and smelled like dirty laundry.
10234,"“There,” she said, pointing at the shapeless mass."
10235,"And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tan-"
10236,"gled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, she moved weirdly: He saw it out"
10237,of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror paralyzed
10238,him as he saw the old body collapsing and the great snake pouring
10239,from the place where her neck had been.
10240,The snake struck as he raised his wand: The force of the bite to
10241,his forearm sent the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light
10242,swung dizzyingly around the room and was extinguished: Then a
10243,powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out
10244,"of him: He fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound"
10245,of filthy clothing —
10246,"He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake’s tail, which"
10247,thrashed down upon the table where he had been a second earlier:
10248,Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the floor.
10249,"From below he heard Hermione call, “Harry?”"
10250,He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back: Then
10251,a heavy smooth mass smashed him to the floor and he felt it slide
10252,"over him, powerful, muscular —"
10253,"“No!” he gasped, pinned to the floor."
10254,"“Yes,” whispered the voice. “Yesss . . . hold you . . . hold you . . .”"
10255, 340    
10256,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10257,“Accio . . . Accio Wand . . .”
10258,But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the
10259,"snake from him as it coiled itself around his torso, squeezing the air"
10260,"from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a circle of ice"
10261,"that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his"
10262,"brain was flooding with cold, white light, all thought obliterated,"
10263,"his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, everything going. . . ."
10264,"A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was fly-"
10265,"ing, flying with triumph in his heart, without need of broomstick"
10266,or thestral. . . .
10267,He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had
10268,released him. He scrambled up and saw the snake outlined against
10269,"the landing light: It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a shriek;"

10271,zen air filled the room as Harry ducked to avoid another shower of
10272,broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like something — his
10273,wand —
10274,"He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the"
10275,"snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione was nowhere to be seen and for"
10276,"a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang"
10277,"and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking"
10278,"Harry hard in the face as it went, coil after heavy coil rising up to"
10279,"the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared"
10280,"more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years."
10281,"“He’s coming! Hermione, he’s coming!”"
10282,"As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos:"
10283,"It smashed shelves from the wall, and splintered china flew every-"

10285,knew to be Hermione —

10288,She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed: The
10289,"snake reared again, but Harry knew that worse than the snake was"
10290,"coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to split"
10291,open with the pain from his scar —
10292,"The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione"
10293,"with him; as it struck, Hermione screamed, “Confringo!” and her spell"
10294,"flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe mirror and ricochet-"
10295,"ing back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat"
10296,"of it sear the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermi-"
10297,"one with him, he leapt from bed to broken dressing table and then"
10298,"straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream"
10299,reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair. . . .
10300,And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was
10301,"running across the fetid bedroom, his long white hands clutching"
10302,at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the little woman
10303,"twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled"
10304,"with the girl’s, that echoed across the dark gardens over the church"
10305,bells ringing in Christmas Day. . . .
10306,"And his scream was Harry’s scream, his pain was Harry’s pain . . ."
10307,"that it could happen here, where it had happened before . . . here,"
10308,within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing
10309,what it was to die . . . to die. . . . The pain was so terrible . . . ripped
10310,"from his body. . . . But if he had no body, why did his head hurt so"

10319,and rightness in him that he always knew on these occasions. . . . Not
10320,"anger . . . that was for weaker souls than he . . . but triumph, yes. . . ."
10321,"He had waited for this, he had hoped for it. . . ."
10322,"“Nice costume, mister!”"
10323,He saw the small boy’s smile falter as he ran near enough to see be-
10324,"neath the hood of the cloak, saw the fear cloud his painted face: Then"
10325,the child turned and ran away. . . . Beneath the robe he fingered the
10326,handle of his wand. . . . One simple movement and the child would
10327,"never reach his mother . . . but unnecessary, quite unnecessary. . . ."
10328,"And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destina-"
10329,"tion was in sight at last, the Fidelius Charm broken, though they did"
10330,not know it yet. . . . And he made less noise than the dead leaves slith-
10331,"ering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and"
10332,stared over it. . . .
10333,They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their
10334,"little sitting room, the tall black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs"
10335,of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the amusement of the small
10336,black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. The child was laughing and try-
10337,"ing to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist. . . ."
10338,"A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not"
10339,"hear, her long dark-red hair falling over her face. Now the father scooped"
10340,up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw his wand down
10341,"upon the sofa and stretched, yawning. . . ."
10342,"The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did"
10343,not hear. His white hand pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and
10344,"pointed it at the door, which burst open."
10345,He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It
10346,"was easy, too easy, he had not even picked up his wand. . . ."
10347,"“Lily, take Harry and go! It’s him! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off!”"
10348, 343   
10349,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10350,"Hold him off, without a wand in his hand! . . . He laughed before"
10351,casting the curse. . . .
10352,“Avada Kedavra!”
10353,"The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pram pushed"
10354,"against the wall, it made the banisters glare like lightning rods, and"
10355,James Potter fell like a marionette whose strings were cut. . . .
10356,"He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but"
10357,"as long as she was sensible, she, at least, had nothing to fear. . . . He"
10358,"climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to"
10359,barricade herself in. . . . She had no wand upon her either. . . . How
10360,"stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their safety lay in"
10361,"friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments. . . ."
10362,"He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled"
10363,"against it with one lazy wave of his wand . . . and there she stood, the"
10364,"child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her son into the crib"
10365,"behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in"
10366,shielding him from sight she hoped to be chosen instead. . . .
10367,"“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!”"
10368,"“Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now.”"
10369,"“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead —”"
10370,“This is my last warning —”
10371,“Not Harry! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . . Not Harry!
10372,Not Harry! Please — I’ll do anything —”
10373,"“Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!”"
10374,"He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more"
10375,prudent to finish them all. . . .
10376,The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her
10377,"husband. The child had not cried all this time: He could stand, clutch-"
10378,"ing the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the intruder’s face with a"
10379,  344   
10380,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10381,"kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid"
10382,"beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would"
10383,"pop up any moment, laughing —"
10384,He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy’s face: He wanted
10385,"to see it happen, the destruction of this one, inexplicable danger. The"
10386,child began to cry: It had seen that he was not James. He did not like
10387,"it crying, he had never been able to stomach the small ones whining in"
10388,the orphanage —
10389,“Avada Kedavra!”
10390,"And then he broke: He was nothing, nothing but pain and ter-"
10391,"ror, and he must hide himself, not here in the rubble of the ruined"
10392,"house, where the child was trapped and screaming, but far away . . ."
10393,far away. . . .
10394,"“No,” he moaned."
10395,"The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the"
10396,"boy, and yet he was the boy. . . ."
10397,“No . . .”
10398,"And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda’s house, im-"
10399,"mersed in memories of his greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake"
10400,slithered over broken china and glass. . . . He looked down and saw
10401,something . . . something incredible. . . .
10402,“No . . .”
10403,"“Harry, it’s all right, you’re all right!”"
10404,He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he
10405,"was, the unknown thief, the thief he was seeking. . . ."
10406,“No . . . I dropped it. . . . I dropped it. . . .”
10407,"“Harry, it’s okay, wake up, wake up!”"
10408,"He was Harry. . . . Harry, not Voldemort . . . and the thing that"
10409,was rustling was not a snake. . . . He opened his eyes.
10410, 345   
10411,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10412,"“Harry,” Hermione whispered. “Do you feel all — all right?”"
10413,"“Yes,” he lied."
10414,"He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap"
10415,of blankets. He could tell that it was almost dawn by the stillness and
10416,"the quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He was"
10417,drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets.
10418,“We got away.”
10419,"“Yes,” said Hermione. “I had to use a Hover Charm to get you"
10420,"into your bunk, I couldn’t lift you. You’ve been . . . Well, you haven’t"
10421,been quite . . .”
10422,There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed
10423,a small sponge in her hand: She had been wiping his face.
10424,"“You’ve been ill,” she finished. “Quite ill.”"
10425,“How long ago did we leave?”
10426,“Hours ago. It’s nearly morning.”
10427,"“And I’ve been . . . what, unconscious?”"
10428,"“Not exactly,” said Hermione uncomfortably. “You’ve been shout-"
10429,"ing and moaning and . . . things,” she added in a tone that made"
10430,Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like Volde-
10431,"mort, cried like the baby in the crib?"
10432,"“I couldn’t get the Horcrux off you,” Hermione said, and he knew"
10433,"she wanted to change the subject. “It was stuck, stuck to your chest."
10434,"You’ve got a mark; I’m sorry, I had to use a Severing Charm to get"
10435,"it away. The snake bit you too, but I’ve cleaned the wound and put"
10436,some dittany on it. . . .”
10437,He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself
10438,and looked down. There was a scarlet oval over his heart where the
10439,locket had burned him. He could also see the half-healed puncture
10440,marks to his forearm.
10441, 346   
10442,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10443,“Where’ve you put the Horcrux?”
10444,“In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while.”
10445,He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray
10446,face.
10447,"“We shouldn’t have gone to Godric’s Hollow. It’s my fault, it’s all"
10448,"my fault, Hermione, I’m sorry.”"
10449,“It’s not your fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumble-
10450,dore might have left the sword there for you.”
10451,"“Yeah, well . . . we got that wrong, didn’t we?”"
10452,"“What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you"
10453,upstairs? Was the snake hiding somewhere? Did it just come out
10454,and kill her and attack you?”
10455,"“No,” he said. “She was the snake . . . or the snake was her . . ."
10456,all along.”
10457,“W-what?”
10458,He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda’s house on him:
10459,It made the whole thing horribly vivid.
10460,“Bathilda must’ve been dead a while. The snake was . . . was in-
10461,"side her. You-Know-Who put it there in Godric’s Hollow, to wait."
10462,You were right. He knew I’d go back.”
10463,“The snake was inside her?”
10464,"He opened his eyes again: Hermione looked revolted,"
10465,nauseated.
10466,"“Lupin said there would be magic we’d never imagined,” Harry"
10467,"said. “She didn’t want to talk in front of you, because it was"
10468,"Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn’t realize, but of course I"
10469,"could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent"
10470,"a message to You-Know-Who, I heard it happen inside my head, I"
10471,"felt him get excited, he said to keep me there . . . and then . . .”"
10472, 347   
10473,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
10474,He remembered the snake coming our of Bathilda’s neck: Hermi-
10475,one did not need to know the details.
10476,"“. . . she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked.”"
10477,He looked down at the puncture marks.
10478,"“It wasn’t supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-"
10479,Who came.”
10480,"If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been"
10481,"worth it, all of it. . . . Sick at heart, he sat up and threw back the"
10482,covers.
10483,"“Harry, no, I’m sure you ought to rest!”"
10484,"“You’re the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible."
10485,I’m fine. I’ll keep watch for a while. Where’s my wand?”
10486,"She did not answer, she merely looked at him."
10487,"“Where’s my wand, Hermione?”"
10488,"She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes."
10489,“Harry . . .”
10490,“Where’s my wand?”
10491,She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him.
10492,The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One frag-
10493,ile strand of phoenix feather kept both pieces hanging together. The
10494,wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his hands
10495,as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury.
10496,He could not think properly: Everything was a blur of panic and
10497,fear. Then he held out the wand to Hermione.
10498,“Mend it. Please.”
10499,"“Harry, I don’t think, when it’s broken like this —”"
10500,"“Please, Hermione, try!”"
10501,“R-Reparo.”
10502,The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. Harry held it up.
10503, 348   
10504,BATHILDA’S SECRET
10505,“Lumos!”
10506,"The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at"
10507,Hermione.
10508,“Expelliarmus!”
10509,"Hermione’s wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand."
10510,"The feeble attempt at magic was too much for Harry’s wand, which"
10511,"split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in what"
10512,he was seeing . . . the wand that had survived so much . . .
10513,"“Harry,” Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her."
10514,"“I’m so, so sorry. I think it was me. As we were leaving, you know,"
10515,"the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting Curse, and it"
10516,"rebounded everywhere, and it must have — must have hit —”"
10517,"“It was an accident,” said Harry mechanically. He felt empty,"
10518,stunned. “We’ll — we’ll find a way to repair it.”
10519,"“Harry, I don’t think we’re going to be able to,” said Hermione,"
10520,the tears trickling down her face. “Remember . . . remember Ron?
10521,"When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same"
10522,"again, he had to get a new one.”"
10523,"Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by"
10524,"Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who was dead. How was he supposed"
10525,to find himself a new wand?
10526,"“Well,” he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, “well, I’ll just"
10527,"borrow yours for now, then. While I keep watch.”"
10528,"Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand,"
10529,"and he left her sitting beside his bed, desiring nothing more than"
10530,to get away from her.

10535,"T       he sun was coming up: The pure, colorless vastness of the"
10536,"sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his suffering."
10537,Harry sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep breath of clean
10538,air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over the sparkling snowy
10539,"hillside ought to have been the greatest treasure on earth, yet he"
10540,could not appreciate it: His senses had been spiked by the calamity
10541,"of losing his wand. He looked out over a valley blanketed in snow,"
10542,distant church bells chiming through the glittering silence.
10543,"Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if"
10544,he were trying to resist physical pain. He had spilled his own blood
10545,more times than he could count; he had lost all the bones in his
10546,right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest
10547,"and forearm to join those on his hand and forehead, but never, until"
10548,"this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally weakened, vulnerable,"
10549,"and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been"
10550,torn from him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he
10551, 350   
10552,THE LIFE AND LIES OF
10553,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
10554,expressed any of this: The wand is only as good as the wizard. But
10555,"she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin"
10556,like the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy.
10557,"He had lost the protection of the twin cores, and only now that it"
10558,was gone did he realize how much he had been counting upon it.
10559,"He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and,"
10560,"without looking at them, tucked them away in Hagrid’s pouch"
10561,around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and use-
10562,less objects to take any more. Harry’s hand brushed the old Snitch
10563,through the mokeskin and for a moment he had to fight the temp-
10564,"tation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful,"
10565,"useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind —"
10566,"And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava,"
10567,"scorching him inside, wiping out every other feeling. Out of sheer"
10568,desperation they had talked themselves into believing that Godric’s
10569,"Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed"
10570,"to go back, that it was all part of some secret path laid out for them"
10571,"by Dumbledore; but there was no map, no plan. Dumbledore had"
10572,"left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and"
10573,"undreamed-of terrors, alone and unaided: Nothing was explained,"
10574,"nothing was given freely, they had no sword, and now, Harry had"
10575,"no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it"
10576,would surely be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was. . . .
10577,Voldemort had all the information now. . . .
10578,“Harry?”
10579,Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her
10580,"own wand. Her face streaked with tears, she crouched down beside"
10581,"him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky"
10582,under her arm.

10585,"“Thanks,” he said, taking one of the cups."
10586,“Do you mind if I talk to you?”
10587,"“No,” he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings."
10588,"“Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was."
10589,Well . . . I’ve got the book.”
10590,"Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and"
10591,Lies of Albus Dumbledore.
10592,“Where — how — ?”
10593,"“It was in Bathilda’s sitting room, just lying there. . . . This note"
10594,was sticking out of the top of it.”
10595,"Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud."
10596,"“ ‘Dear Batty, Thanks for your help. Here’s a copy of the book, hope"
10597,"you like it. You said everything, even if you don’t remember it. Rita.’"
10598,"I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda was alive, but"
10599,perhaps she wasn’t in any fit state to read it?”
10600,"“No, she probably wasn’t.”"
10601,Harry looked down upon Dumbledore’s face and experienced a
10602,surge of savage pleasure: Now he would know all the things that
10603,"Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether Dum-"
10604,bledore wanted him to or not.
10605,"“You’re still really angry at me, aren’t you?” said Hermione; he"
10606,"looked up to see fresh tears leaking out of her eyes, and knew that"
10607,his anger must have shown in his face.
10608,"“No,” he said quietly. “No, Hermione, I know it was an accident."
10609,"You were trying to get us out of there alive, and you were incredible."
10610,I’d be dead if you hadn’t been there to help me.”
10611,"He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to"
10612,the book. Its spine was stiff; it had clearly never been opened before.
10613,"He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He came"
10614, 352  
10615,THE LIFE AND LIES OF

10617,"across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore"
10618,"and his handsome companion, roaring with laughter at some long-"
10619,forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the caption.
10620,"Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother’s death,"
10621,with his friend Gellert Grindelwald.
10622,Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindel-
10623,"wald. His friend Grindelwald. He looked sideways at Hermione,"
10624,who was still contemplating the name as though she could not be-
10625,lieve her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry.
10626,“Grindelwald?”
10627,"Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the"
10628,pages around them for a recurrence of that fatal name. He soon dis-
10629,"covered it and read greedily, but became lost: It was necessary to go"
10630,"further back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself"
10631,"at the start of a chapter entitled “The Greater Good.” Together, he"
10632,and Hermione started to read:
10633,"Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left"

10642,"London, preparing to depart for Greece the following morning,"
10643,when an owl arrived bearing news of Dumbledore’s mother’s
10644,  353   
10645,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
10646,"death. “Dogbreath” Doge, who refused to be interviewed for"
10647,"this book, has given the public his own sentimental version of"
10648,what happened next. He represents Kendra’s death as a tragic
10649,"blow, and Dumbledore’s decision to give up his expedition as"
10650,an act of noble self-sacrifice.
10651,"Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric’s Hollow at once,"
10652,supposedly to “care” for his younger brother and sister. But
10653,how much care did he actually give them?
10654,"“He were a head case, that Aberforth,” says Enid Smeek,"
10655,whose family lived on the outskirts of Godric’s Hollow at that
10656,"time. “Ran wild. ’Course, with his mum and dad gone you’d"
10657,"have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my"
10658,"head. I don’t think Albus was fussed about him, I never saw"
10659,"them together, anyway.”"
10660,"So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young"
10661,"brother? The answer, it seems, is ensuring the continued im-"
10662,"prisonment of his sister. For, though her first jailer had died,"
10663,there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumble-
10664,dore. Her very existence continued to be known only to those
10665,"few outsiders who, like “Dogbreath” Doge, could be counted"
10666,upon to believe in the story of her “ill health.”
10667,Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was
10668,"Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated magical historian who has"
10669,"lived in Godric’s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course,"
10670,had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the
10671,"family to the village. Several years later, however, the author"
10672,"sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been favorably im-"
10673,pressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Trans-
10674,figuration Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with
10675,  354 
10676,THE LIFE AND LIES OF
10677,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
10678,"the entire Dumbledore family. At the time of Kendra’s death,"
10679,Bathilda was the only person in Godric’s Hollow who was on
10680,speaking terms with Dumbledore’s mother.
10681,"Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier"
10682,"in her life has now dimmed. “The fire’s lit, but the cauldron’s"
10683,"empty,” as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in Enid Smeek’s"
10684,"slightly earthier phrase, “She’s nutty as squirrel poo.” Never-"
10685,"theless, a combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques"
10686,enabled me to extract enough nuggets of hard fact to string
10687,together the whole scandalous story.
10688,"Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra’s"
10689,"premature death down to a backfiring charm, a story repeated"
10690,by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also parrots the
10691,"family line on Ariana, calling her “frail” and “delicate.” On"
10692,"one subject, however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put"
10693,"into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and she alone, knows the"
10694,full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore’s life.
10695,"Now revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything"
10696,that his admirers believed of Dumbledore: his supposed hatred
10697,"of the Dark Arts, his opposition to the oppression of Muggles,"
10698,even his devotion to his own family.
10699,The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to
10700,"Godric’s Hollow, now an orphan and head of the family,"
10701,Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her great-
10702,"nephew, Gellert Grindelwald."
10703,The name of Grindelwald is justly famous: In a list of Most
10704,"Dangerous Dark Wizards of All Time, he would miss out on"
10705,"the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a genera-"
10706,"tion later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended"
10707, 355   
10708,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
10709,"his campaign of terror to Britain, however, the details of his"
10710,rise to power are not widely known here.
10711,"Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its"
10712,"unfortunate tolerance of the Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed"
10713,himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. Rather
10714,than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and
10715,"prizes, however, Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself to other"
10716,"pursuits. At sixteen years old, even Durmstrang felt it could no"
10717,longer turn a blind eye to the twisted experiments of Gellert
10718,"Grindelwald, and he was expelled."
10719,"Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald’s next"
10720,movements is that he “traveled abroad for some months.” It can
10721,now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his great-aunt
10722,"in Godric’s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though"
10723,"it will be for many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship"
10724,with none other than Albus Dumbledore.
10725,"“He seemed a charming boy to me,” babbles Bathilda,"
10726,“whatever he became later. Naturally I introduced him to poor
10727,"Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own age. The"
10728,boys took to each other at once.”
10729,"They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her,"
10730,that Albus Dumbledore sent Gellert Grindelwald in the dead
10731,of night.
10732,"“Yes, even after they’d spent all day in discussion — both"
10733,"such brilliant young boys, they got on like a cauldron on"
10734,fire — I’d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert’s bedroom
10735,"window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have"
10736,"struck him, and he had to let Gellert know immediately!”"
10737,And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though

10741,"Albus Dumbledore’s fans will find it, here are the thoughts of"
10742,"their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best friend."
10743,(A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.)
10744,Gellert —
10745,Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR
10746,"THE MUGGLES’ OWN GOOD — this, I think, is the cru-"
10747,"cial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes,"
10748,"that power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives"
10749,us responsibilities over the ruled. We must stress this
10750,"point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we"
10751,"build. Where we are opposed, as we surely will be,"
10752,this must be the basis of all our counterarguments. We
10753,seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this
10754,"it follows that where we meet resistance, we must use"
10755,only the force that is necessary and no more. (This was
10756,"your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain,"
10757,"because if you had not been expelled, we would never"
10758,have met.)
10759,Albus
10760,Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will
10761,"be, this letter constitutes proof that Albus Dumbledore once"
10762,dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and establish-
10763,ing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have
10764,always portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns’ greatest
10765,champion! How hollow those speeches promoting Muggle
10766,rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How
10767,"despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his"
10768,  357   
10769,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
10770,rise to power when he should have been mourning his mother
10771,and caring for his sister!
10772,No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his
10773,"crumbling pedestal will bleat that he did not, after all, put"
10774,"his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of"
10775,"heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems"
10776,altogether more shocking.
10777,"Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dum-"
10778,"bledore and Grindelwald parted, never to see each other again"
10779,"until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see chapter"
10780,22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come
10781,to his senses? Had he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part
10782,"in his plans? Alas, no."
10783,"“It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,” says"
10784,Bathilda. “It came as an awful shock. Gellert was there in the
10785,"house when it happened, and he came back to my house all of"
10786,"a dither, told me he wanted to go home the next day. Terribly"
10787,"distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was"
10788,the last I saw of him.
10789,“Albus was beside himself at Ariana’s death. It was so dread-
10790,ful for those two brothers. They had lost everybody except
10791,each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. Aberforth
10792,"blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dread-"
10793,"ful circumstances. But Aberforth always talked a little madly,"
10794,"poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus’s nose at the funeral"
10795,was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons
10796,"fighting like that, across her daughter’s body. A shame Gellert"
10797,could not have stayed for the funeral. . . . He would have been
10798,"a comfort to Albus, at least. . . .”"
10799, 358   
10800,THE LIFE AND LIES OF

10802,"This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few"
10803,"who attended Ariana Dumbledore’s funeral, raises several ques-"
10804,tions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore blame Albus
10805,"for his sister’s death? Was it, as “Batty” pretends, a mere effu-"
10806,sion of grief? Or could there have been some more concrete
10807,"reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled from Durmstrang"
10808,"for near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country"
10809,"hours after the girl’s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?)"
10810,"never saw him again, not until forced to do so by the pleas of"
10811,the Wizarding world.
10812,Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have
10813,referred to this brief boyhood friendship in later life. How-
10814,"ever, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for"
10815,"some five years of turmoil, fatalities, and disappearances, his"
10816,attack upon Gellert Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection
10817,for the man or fear of exposure as his once best friend that
10818,caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that
10819,Dumbledore set out to capture the man he was once so de-
10820,lighted he had met?
10821,And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the in-
10822,advertent victim of some Dark rite? Did she stumble across
10823,"something she ought not to have done, as the two young men"
10824,sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it
10825,possible that Ariana Dumbledore was the first person to die
10826,“for the greater good”?
10827,The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had
10828,reached the bottom of the page before him. She tugged the book
10829,"out of Harry’s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression,"
10830, 359   
10831,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
10832,"and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something"
10833,indecent.
10834,“Harry —”
10835,But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down
10836,inside him; it was exactly as he had felt after Ron left. He had
10837,"trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness"
10838,"and wisdom. All was ashes: How much more could he lose? Ron,"
10839,"Dumbledore, the phoenix wand . . ."
10840,“Harry.” She seemed to have heard his thoughts. “Listen to me.
10841,It — it doesn’t make very nice reading —”
10842,"“Yeah, you could say that —”"
10843,"“— but don’t forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing.”"
10844,"“You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn’t you?”"
10845,"“Yes, I — I did.” She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea"
10846,in her cold hands. “I think that’s the worst bit. I know Bathilda
10847,"thought it was all just talk, but ‘For the Greater Good’ became"
10848,"Grindelwald’s slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he com-"
10849,mitted later. And . . . from that . . . it looks like Dumbledore gave
10850,him the idea. They say ‘For the Greater Good’ was even carved over
10851,the entrance to Nurmengard.”
10852,“What’s Nurmengard?”
10853,“The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He
10854,"ended up in there himself, once Dumbledore had caught him. Any-"
10855,"way, it’s — it’s an awful thought that Dumbledore’s ideas helped"
10856,"Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can’t"
10857,pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one
10858,"summer when they were both really young, and —”"
10859,"“I thought you’d say that,” said Harry. He did not want to let his"
10860,"anger spill out at her, but it was hard to keep his voice steady. “I"
10861,  360   
10862,THE LIFE AND LIES OF
10863,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
10864,thought you’d say ‘They were young.’ They were the same age as we
10865,"are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts,"
10866,"and there he was, in a huddle with his new best friend, plotting their"
10867,rise to power over the Muggles.”
10868,His temper would not remain in check much longer: He stood
10869,"up and walked around, trying to work some of it off."
10870,"“I’m not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote,” said Hermi-"
10871,"one. “All that ‘right to rule’ rubbish, it’s ‘Magic Is Might’ all over"
10872,"again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck alone in"
10873,the house —”
10874,“Alone? He wasn’t alone! He had his brother and sister for com-
10875,"pany, his Squib sister he was keeping locked up —”"
10876,"“I don’t believe it,” said Hermione. She stood up too. “Whatever"
10877,"was wrong with that girl, I don’t think she was a Squib. The Dum-"
10878,"bledore we knew would never, ever have allowed —”"
10879,“The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn’t want to conquer

10881,"empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, squawking"
10882,and spiraling against the pearly sky.
10883,"“He changed, Harry, he changed! It’s as simple as that! Maybe he"
10884,"did believe these things when he was seventeen, but the whole of the"
10885,rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! Dumbledore
10886,"was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for"
10887,"Muggle protection and Muggle-born rights, who fought You-Know-"
10888,"Who from the start, and who died trying to bring him down!”"
10889,"Rita’s book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of"
10890,Albus Dumbledore smiled dolefully at both.
10891,"“Harry, I’m sorry, but I think the real reason you’re so angry is"
10892,that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself.”
10893, 361   
10894,CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
10895,"“Maybe I am!” Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his"
10896,"head, hardly knowing whether he was trying to hold in his anger or"
10897,protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. “Look
10898,"what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And"
10899,"again! And again! And don’t expect me to explain everything, just"
10900,"trust me blindly, trust that I know what I’m doing, trust me even"
10901,though I don’t trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!”
10902,"His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each"
10903,"other in the whiteness and the emptiness, and Harry felt they were"
10904,as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky.
10905,"“He loved you,” Hermione whispered. “I know he loved you.”"
10906,Harry dropped his arms.
10907,"“I don’t know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This"
10908,"isn’t love, the mess he’s left me in. He shared a damn sight more of"
10909,what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever
10910,shared with me.”
10911,"Harry picked up Hermione’s wand, which he had dropped in the"
10912,"snow, and sat back down in the entrance of the tent."
10913,“Thanks for the tea. I’ll finish the watch. You get back in the
10914,warm.”
10915,"She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the"
10916,"book and then walked back past him into the tent, but as she did"
10917,"so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed"
10918,"his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she"
10919,said was true: that Dumbledore had really cared.

10924,at midnight. Harry’s dreams were confused and disturbing:
10925,"Nagini wove in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked"
10926,"ring, then through a wreath of Christmas roses. He woke repeat-"
10927,"edly, panicky, convinced that somebody had called out to him in"
10928,"the distance, imagining that the wind whipping around the tent"
10929,was footsteps or voices.
10930,"Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was"
10931,huddled in the entrance to the tent reading A History of Magic by the
10932,"light of her wand. The snow was still falling thickly, and she greeted"
10933,with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on.
10934,"“We’ll go somewhere more sheltered,” she agreed, shivering as she"
10935,pulled on a sweatshirt over her pajamas. “I kept thinking I could
10936,hear people moving outside. I even thought I saw somebody once
10937,or twice.”
10938, 363  

10940,Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at
10941,"the silent, motionless Sneakoscope on the table."
10942,"“I’m sure I imagined it,” said Hermione, looking nervous. “The"
10943,"snow in the dark, it plays tricks on your eyes. . . . But perhaps we"
10944,"ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?”"
10945,"Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Hor-"
10946,"crux, and Hermione clutching the beaded bag, they Disapparated."
10947,The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry’s feet parted company
10948,"with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like"
10949,frozen earth covered with leaves.
10950,"“Where are we?” he asked, peering around at a fresh mass of"
10951,trees as Hermione opened the beaded bag and began tugging out
10952,tent poles.
10953,"“The Forest of Dean,” she said. “I came camping here once with"
10954,my mum and dad.”
10955,"Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold,"
10956,but they were at least protected from the wind. They spent most
10957,"of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around the useful"
10958,"bright blue flames that Hermione was so adept at producing, and"
10959,which could be scooped up and carried around in a jar. Harry felt
10960,"as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, an"
10961,impression reinforced by Hermione’s solicitousness. That afternoon
10962,"fresh flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered"
10963,clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery snow.
10964,"After two nights of little sleep, Harry’s senses seemed more alert"
10965,than usual. Their escape from Godric’s Hollow had been so narrow
10966,"that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more threaten-"
10967,ing. As darkness drew in again Harry refused Hermione’s offer to
10968,keep watch and told her to go to bed.
10969,  364 
10970,THE SILVER DOE
10971,"Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down,"
10972,"wearing all the sweaters he owned but even so, still shivery. The dark-"
10973,ness deepened with the passing hours until it was virtually impen-
10974,"etrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder’s Map, so as"
10975,"to watch Ginny’s dot for a while, before he remembered that it was"
10976,the Christmas holidays and that she would be back at the Burrow.
10977,Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the
10978,"forest. Harry knew that it must be full of living creatures, but he"
10979,wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could sepa-
10980,rate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might
10981,"proclaim other, sinister movements. He remembered the sound of"
10982,"a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and at once"
10983,thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their
10984,protective enchantments had worked for weeks; why should they
10985,break now? And yet he could not throw off the feeling that some-
10986,thing was different tonight.
10987,"Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had"
10988,"fallen asleep, slumped at an awkward angle against the side of the"
10989,tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness that he
10990,might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparition and
10991,Apparition. He had just held up a hand in front of his face to see
10992,whether he could make out his fingers when it happened.
10993,"A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through"
10994,"the trees. Whatever the source, it was moving soundlessly. The light"
10995,seemed simply to drift toward him.
10996,"He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised"
10997,Hermione’s wand. He screwed up his eyes as the light became blind-
10998,"ing, the trees in front of it pitch-black in silhouette, and still the"
10999,thing came closer. . . .
11000, 365   
11001,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11002,And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an
11003,"oak. It was a silver-white doe, moon-bright and dazzling, picking"
11004,"her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints in"
11005,"the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful"
11006,"head with its wide, long-lashed eyes held high."
11007,"Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her"
11008,"strangeness, but at her inexplicable familiarity. He felt that he had"
11009,"been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this"
11010,"moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for"
11011,"Hermione, which had been so strong a moment ago, had gone. He"
11012,"knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come for"
11013,"him, and him alone."
11014,They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she
11015,turned and walked away.
11016,"“No,” he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. “Come"
11017,back!”
11018,"She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her"
11019,brightness was striped by their thick black trunks. For one trembling
11020,"second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a trick, a lure,"
11021,"a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was"
11022,not Dark Magic. He set off in pursuit.
11023,"Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as"
11024,"she passed through the trees, for she was nothing but light. Deeper"
11025,"and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked quickly,"
11026,"sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her"
11027,properly. And then she would speak and the voice would tell him
11028,what he needed to know.
11029,"At last, she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward"
11030, 366  
11031,THE SILVER DOE
11032,"him once more, and he broke into a run, a question burning in him,"
11033,"but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished."
11034,"Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished"
11035,"image was still imprinted on his retinas; it obscured his vision,"
11036,"brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now"
11037,fear came: Her presence had meant safety.
11038,"“Lumos!” he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited."
11039,The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as
11040,"he stood there, listening to the sounds of the forest, to distant crack-"
11041,"les of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be attacked? Had"
11042,she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody
11043,"stood beyond the reach of the wandlight, watching him?"
11044,"He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of"
11045,"green light burst from behind a tree. Why, then, had she led him"
11046,to this spot?
11047,"Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun"
11048,"about, but all that was there was a small, frozen pool, its cracked"
11049,black surface glittering as he raised the wand higher to examine it.
11050,He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice
11051,"reflected his distorted shadow and the beam of wandlight, but deep"
11052,"below the thick, misty gray carapace, something else glinted. A great"
11053,silver cross . . .
11054,His heart skipped into his mouth: He dropped to his knees at the
11055,pool’s edge and angled the wand so as to flood the bottom of the
11056,pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red . . . It was a
11057,sword with glittering rubies in its hilt. . . . The sword of Gryffindor
11058,was lying at the bottom of the forest pool.
11059,"Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible?"
11060, 367  
11061,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11062,"How could it have come to be lying in a forest pool, this close to the"
11063,place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic drawn
11064,"Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a"
11065,"Patronus, some kind of guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been"
11066,"put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely because they were"
11067,"here? In which case, where was the person who had wanted to pass"
11068,it to Harry? Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees
11069,"and bushes, searching for a human outline, for the glint of an eye,"
11070,"but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear"
11071,leavened his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword
11072,reposing upon the bottom of the frozen pool.
11073,"He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, “Accio"
11074,Sword.”
11075,"It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy,"
11076,"the sword would have lain on the ground for him to pick up, not"
11077,"in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice,"
11078,thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to
11079,"him. He had been in terrible danger then, and had asked for help."
11080,"“Help,” he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool"
11081,"bottom, indifferent, motionless."
11082,"What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumble-"
11083,dore had told him the last time he had retrieved the sword? Only a
11084,true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what were the
11085,qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry’s head
11086,"answered him: Their daring, nerve, and chivalry set Gryffindors apart."
11087,"Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath"
11088,dispersing rapidly upon the frozen air. He knew what he had to do.
11089,"If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might come to this"
11090,from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice.
11091, 368   
11092,THE SILVER DOE
11093,"He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was con-"
11094,vinced now that nobody was going to attack him. They had had their
11095,"chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had plenty of oppor-"
11096,tunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point
11097,was because the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting.
11098,With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers
11099,"of clothing. Where “chivalry” entered into this, he thought ruefully,"
11100,"he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that he was"
11101,not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead.
11102,"An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought"
11103,"with a pang of Hedwig. He was shivering now, his teeth chatter-"
11104,"ing horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood"
11105,"there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch"
11106,"containing his wand, his mother’s letter, the shard of Sirius’s mirror,"
11107,"and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed Hermione’s"
11108,wand at the ice.
11109,“Diffindo.”
11110,It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence: The surface
11111,of the pool broke and chunks of dark ice rocked on the ruffled wa-
11112,"ter. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve the"
11113,sword he would have to submerge himself completely.
11114,Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the
11115,water warmer. He stepped to the pool’s edge and placed Hermione’s
11116,"wand on the ground, still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how much"
11117,colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be
11118,"shivering, he jumped."
11119,Every pore of his body screamed in protest: The very air in his
11120,lungs seemed to freeze solid as he was submerged to his shoulders
11121,in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe; trembling so violently
11122, 369   
11123,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11124,"the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with"
11125,his numb feet. He only wanted to dive once.
11126,Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to
11127,"second, gasping and shaking, until he told himself that it must be"
11128,"done, gathered all his courage, and dived."
11129,The cold was agony: It attacked him like fire. His brain itself
11130,seemed to have frozen as he pushed through the dark water to the
11131,"bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers closed"
11132,around the hilt; he pulled it upward.
11133,Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of wa-
11134,"ter weeds, though nothing had brushed him as he dived, and raised"
11135,his empty hand to free himself. It was not weed: The chain of the
11136,Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe.
11137,"Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the sur-"
11138,"face, but merely propelled himself into the rocky side of the pool."
11139,"Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, his"
11140,"frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were pop-"
11141,"ping inside his head, and he was going to drown, there was nothing"
11142,"left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around his chest"
11143,were surely Death’s. . . .
11144,"Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been"
11145,"in his life, he came to facedown in the snow. Somewhere close by,"
11146,another person was panting and coughing and staggering around.
11147,"Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake at-"
11148,"tacked. . . . Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs,"
11149,not judging by the weight of the footsteps. . . .
11150,Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior’s identity.
11151,All he could do was raise a shaking hand to his throat and feel the
11152,place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was gone:
11153, 370   
11154,THE SILVER DOE
11155,Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over
11156,his head.
11157,“Are — you — mental?”
11158,Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given
11159,"Harry the strength to get up. Shivering violently, he staggered to"
11160,"his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but drenched"
11161,"to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor"
11162,in one hand and the Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in
11163,the other.
11164,"“Why the hell,” panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which"
11165,swung backward and forward on its shortened chain in some parody
11166,"of hypnosis, “didn’t you take this thing off before you dived?”"
11167,"Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing"
11168,compared with Ron’s reappearance; he could not believe it. Shud-
11169,"dering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still lying at the"
11170,water’s edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after
11171,"sweater over his head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to"
11172,"have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, and yet he had to"
11173,"be real: He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry’s life."
11174,"“It was y-you?” Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice"
11175,weaker than usual due to his near-strangulation.
11176,"“Well, yeah,” said Ron, looking slightly confused."
11177,“Y-you cast that doe?”
11178,"“What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!”"
11179,“My Patronus is a stag.”
11180,“Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers.”
11181,"Harry put Hagrid’s pouch back around his neck, pulled on a"
11182,"final sweater, stooped to pick up Hermione’s wand, and faced Ron"
11183,again.
11184, 371  
11185,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11186,“How come you’re here?”
11187,"Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later,"
11188,if at all.
11189,"“Well, I’ve — you know — I’ve come back. If —” He cleared his"
11190,throat. “You know. You still want me.”
11191,"There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron’s departure seemed"
11192,to rise like a wall between them. Yet he was here. He had returned.
11193,He had just saved Harry’s life.
11194,Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised
11195,to see the things he was holding.
11196,"“Oh yeah, I got it out,” he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up"
11197,"the sword for Harry’s inspection. “That’s why you jumped in,"
11198,right?”
11199,"“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I don’t understand. How did you get"
11200,here? How did you find us?”
11201,"“Long story,” said Ron. “I’ve been looking for you for hours, it’s"
11202,"a big forest, isn’t it? And I was just thinking I’d have to kip under a"
11203,tree and wait for morning when I saw that deer coming and you
11204,following.”
11205,“You didn’t see anyone else?”
11206,"“No,” said Ron. “I —”"
11207,"But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together"
11208,some yards away.
11209,"“I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running"
11210,"to the pool at the time, because you’d gone in and you hadn’t come"
11211,"up, so I wasn’t going to make a detour to — hey!”"
11212,Harry was already hurrying to the place Ron had indicated. The
11213,two oaks grew close together; there was a gap of only a few inches
11214,"between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see but not be seen."
11215, 372   
11216,THE SILVER DOE
11217,"The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry"
11218,could see no sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood
11219,"waiting, still holding the sword and the Horcrux."
11220,“Anything there?” Ron asked.
11221,"“No,” said Harry."
11222,“So how did the sword get in that pool?”
11223,“Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there.”
11224,"They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glint-"
11225,ing a little in the light from Hermione’s wand.
11226,“You reckon this is the real one?” asked Ron.
11227,"“One way to find out, isn’t there?” said Harry."
11228,The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron’s hand. The locket
11229,was twitching slightly. Harry knew that the thing inside it was
11230,agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had
11231,tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not
11232,the time for long discussions; now was the moment to destroy the
11233,"locket once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione’s"
11234,"wand high, and saw the place: a flattish rock lying in the shadow"
11235,of a sycamore tree.
11236,"“Come here,” he said, and he led the way, brushed snow from the"
11237,"rock’s surface, and held out his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron"
11238,"offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head."
11239,"“No, you should do it.”"
11240,"“Me?” said Ron, looking shocked. “Why?”"
11241,“Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it’s supposed
11242,to be you.”
11243,He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known
11244,"that the doe was benign, he knew that Ron had to be the one to"
11245,wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry something
11246, 373  
11247,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11248,"about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain"
11249,acts.
11250,"“I’m going to open it,” said Harry, “and you stab it. Straightaway,"
11251,okay? Because whatever’s in there will put up a fight. The bit of
11252,Riddle in the diary tried to kill me.”
11253,“How are you going to open it?” asked Ron. He looked terrified.
11254,"“I’m going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue,” said Harry. The"
11255,answer came so readily to his lips that he thought that he had always
11256,known it deep down: Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter with
11257,"Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid"
11258,with glittering green stones: It was easy to visualize it as a minuscule
11259,"snake, curled upon the cold rock."
11260,"“No!” said Ron. “No, don’t open it! I’m serious!”"
11261,"“Why not?” asked Harry. “Let’s get rid of the damn thing, it’s"
11262,been months —”
11263,"“I can’t, Harry, I’m serious — you do it —”"
11264,“But why?”
11265,"“Because that thing’s bad for me!” said Ron, backing away from"
11266,"the locket on the rock. “I can’t handle it! I’m not making excuses,"
11267,"Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affected"
11268,"you and Hermione, it made me think stuff — stuff I was thinking"
11269,"anyway, but it made everything worse, I can’t explain it, and then"
11270,"I’d take it off and I’d get my head on straight again, and then I’d"
11271,"have to put the effing thing back on — I can’t do it, Harry!”"
11272,"He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his"
11273,head.
11274,"“You can do it,” said Harry, “you can! You’ve just got the sword,"
11275,"I know it’s supposed to be you who uses it. Please, just get rid of"
11276,"it, Ron.”"
11277, 374  
11278,THE SILVER DOE
11279,The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swal-
11280,"lowed, then, still breathing hard through his long nose, moved back"
11281,toward the rock.
11282,"“Tell me when,” he croaked."
11283,"“On three,” said Harry, looking back down at the locket and nar-"
11284,"rowing his eyes, concentrating on the letter S, imagining a serpent,"
11285,while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped cockroach. It
11286,"would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry’s"
11287,neck still burned.
11288,“One . . . two . . . three . . . open.”
11289,The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of
11290,the locket swung wide with a little click.
11291,"Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye,"
11292,dark and handsome as Tom Riddle’s eyes had been before he turned
11293,them scarlet and slit-pupiled.
11294,"“Stab,” said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock."
11295,Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands: The point dangled
11296,"over the frantically swiveling eyes, and Harry gripped the locket"
11297,"tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from the"
11298,empty windows.
11299,Then a voice hissed from out of the Horcrux.
11300,"“I have seen your heart, and it is mine.”"
11301,“Don’t listen to it!” Harry said harshly. “Stab it!”
11302,"“I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears."
11303,"All you desire is possible, but all that you dread is also possible. . . .”"
11304,“Stab!” shouted Harry; his voice echoed off the surrounding
11305,"trees, the sword point trembled, and Ron gazed down into Riddle’s"
11306,eyes.
11307,"“Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter . . . Least"
11308,  375   
11309,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11310,"loved, now, by the girl who prefers your friend . . . Second best, always,"
11311,eternally overshadowed . . .”
11312,"“Ron, stab it now!” Harry bellowed: He could feel the locket"
11313,quivering in his grip and was scared of what was coming. Ron
11314,"raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle’s eyes gleamed"
11315,scarlet.
11316,"Out of the locket’s two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed,"
11317,"like two grotesque bubbles, the heads of Harry and Hermione,"
11318,weirdly distorted.
11319,Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out
11320,"of the locket, first chests, then waists, then legs, until they stood in"
11321,"the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, swaying over"
11322,"Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from"
11323,"the locket as it burned, suddenly, white-hot."
11324,"“Ron!” he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with"
11325,"Voldemort’s voice and Ron was gazing, mesmerized, into its face."
11326,"“Why return? We were better without you, happier without you,"
11327,"glad of your absence. . . . We laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice,"
11328,your presumption —”
11329,"“Presumption!” echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more"
11330,"beautiful and yet more terrible than the real Hermione: She swayed,"
11331,"cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified yet transfixed, the sword"
11332,"hanging pointlessly at his side. “Who could look at you, who would"
11333,"ever look at you, beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, com-"
11334,"pared with the Chosen One? What are you, compared with the Boy"
11335,Who Lived?”
11336,"“Ron, stab it, STAB IT!” Harry yelled, but Ron did not move:"
11337,"His eyes were wide, and the Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione"
11338, 376  
11339,THE SILVER DOE
11340,"were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their eyes"
11341,"shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet."
11342,"“Your mother confessed,” sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-"
11343,"Hermione jeered, “that she would have preferred me as a son, would"
11344,be glad to exchange . . .”
11345,"“Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are"
11346,"nothing, nothing, nothing to him,” crooned Riddle-Hermione, and"
11347,she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around Riddle-
11348,"Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace: Their lips met."
11349,"On the ground in front of them, Ron’s face filled with anguish."
11350,"He raised the sword high, his arms shaking."
11351,"“Do it, Ron!” Harry yelled."
11352,"Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of"
11353,scarlet in his eyes.
11354,“Ron — ?”
11355,"The sword flashed, plunged: Harry threw himself out of the way,"
11356,"there was a clang of metal and a long, drawn-out scream. Harry"
11357,"whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend"
11358,himself: but there was nothing to fight.
11359,The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone:
11360,"There was only Ron, standing there with the sword held slackly in"
11361,"his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket on"
11362,the flat rock.
11363,"Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say"
11364,or do. Ron was breathing heavily: His eyes were no longer red at
11365,"all, but their normal blue; they were also wet."
11366,"Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the"
11367,broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced the glass in both windows:
11368, 377  
11369,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11370,"Riddle’s eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket"
11371,was smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had
11372,vanished; torturing Ron had been its final act.
11373,"The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees,"
11374,"his head in his arms. He was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from"
11375,"cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, knelt down"
11376,"beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took"
11377,it as a good sign that Ron did not throw it off.
11378,"“After you left,” he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that"
11379,"Ron’s face was hidden, “she cried for a week. Probably longer, only"
11380,she didn’t want me to see. There were loads of nights when we never
11381,even spoke to each other. With you gone . . .”
11382,He could not finish; it was only now that Ron was here again that
11383,Harry fully realized how much his absence had cost them.
11384,"“She’s like my sister,” he went on. “I love her like a sister and I"
11385,reckon she feels the same way about me. It’s always been like that.
11386,I thought you knew.”
11387,"Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and"
11388,wiped his nose noisily on his sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and
11389,"walked to where Ron’s enormous rucksack lay yards away, discarded"
11390,as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He
11391,"hoisted it onto his own back and walked back to Ron, who clam-"
11392,"bered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but otherwise"
11393,composed.
11394,"“I’m sorry,” he said in a thick voice. “I’m sorry I left. I know I"
11395,was a — a —”

11400,"“You’ve sort of made up for it tonight,” said Harry. “Getting the"
11401,sword. Finishing off the Horcrux. Saving my life.”
11402,"“That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was,” Ron mumbled."
11403,"“Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was,” said"
11404,Harry. “I’ve been trying to tell you that for years.”
11405,"Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping"
11406,the still-sopping back of Ron’s jacket.
11407,"“And now,” said Harry as they broke apart, “all we’ve got to do"
11408,is find the tent again.”
11409,But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest
11410,"with the doe had seemed lengthy, with Ron by his side the journey"
11411,back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry could not wait
11412,"to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he"
11413,"entered the tent, Ron lagging a little behind him."
11414,"It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only"
11415,illumination the bluebell flames still shimmering in a bowl on the
11416,"floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, and"
11417,did not move until Harry had said her name several times.
11418,“Hermione!”
11419,"She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face."
11420,“What’s wrong? Harry? Are you all right?”
11421,"“It’s okay, everything’s fine. More than fine. I’m great. There’s"
11422,someone here.”
11423,“What do you mean? Who — ?”
11424,"She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto"
11425,"the threadbare carpet. Harry backed into a shadowy corner, slipped"
11426,"off Ron’s rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the canvas."
11427,Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker
11428, 379  
11429,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11430,"toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale face. She stopped right in front"
11431,"of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak,"
11432,hopeful smile and half raised his arms.
11433,Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every
11434,inch of him that she could reach.
11435,“Ouch — ow — gerroff! What the — ? Hermione — OW!”
11436,“You — complete — arse — Ronald — Weasley!”
11437,"She punctuated every word with a blow: Ron backed away, shield-"
11438,ing his head as Hermione advanced.
11439,“You — crawl — back — here — after — weeks — and —
11440,"weeks — oh, where’s my wand?”"
11441,She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry’s hands and
11442,he reacted instinctively.
11443,“Protego!”
11444,The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione: The
11445,force of it knocked her backward onto the floor. Spitting hair out
11446,"of her mouth, she leapt up again."
11447,“Hermione!” said Harry. “Calm —”
11448,“I will not calm down!” she screamed. Never before had he seen
11449,her lose control like this; she looked quite demented. “Give me back
11450,my wand! Give it back to me!”
11451,"“Hermione, will you please —”"
11452,"“Don’t you tell me what to do, Harry Potter!” she screeched."
11453,“Don’t you dare! Give it back now! And YOU!”
11454,She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation: It was like a maledic-
11455,"tion, and Harry could not blame Ron for retreating several steps."
11456,“I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come
11457,back!”
11458,"“I know,” Ron said, “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really —”"
11459, 380 
11460,THE SILVER DOE
11461,"“Oh, you’re sorry!”"
11462,"She laughed, a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at"
11463,"Harry for help, but Harry merely grimaced his helplessness."
11464,“You come back after weeks — weeks — and you think it’s all
11465,going to be all right if you just say sorry?”
11466,"“Well, what else can I say?” Ron shouted, and Harry was glad"
11467,that Ron was fighting back.
11468,"“Oh, I don’t know!” yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. “Rack"
11469,"your brains, Ron, that should only take a couple of seconds —”"
11470,"“Hermione,” interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow,"
11471,“he just saved my —”
11472,“I don’t care!” she screamed. “I don’t care what he’s done! Weeks
11473,"and weeks, we could have been dead for all he knew —”"
11474,"“I knew you weren’t dead!” bellowed Ron, drowning her voice"
11475,"for the first time, and approaching as close as he could with the"
11476,"Shield Charm between them. “Harry’s all over the Prophet, all over"
11477,"the radio, they’re looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and"
11478,"mental stories, I knew I’d hear straight off if you were dead, you"
11479,don’t know what it’s been like —”
11480,“What it’s been like for you?”
11481,Her voice was now so shrill only bats would be able to hear it
11482,"soon, but she had reached a level of indignation that rendered her"
11483,"temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity."
11484,"“I wanted to come back the minute I’d Disapparated, but I"
11485,"walked straight into a gang of Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn’t"
11486,go anywhere!”
11487,"“A gang of what?” asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down"
11488,into a chair with her arms and legs crossed so tightly it seemed un-
11489,likely that she would unravel them for several years.
11490,  381   
11491,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11492,"“Snatchers,” said Ron. “They’re everywhere — gangs trying to"
11493,"earn gold by rounding up Muggle-borns and blood traitors, there’s"
11494,a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my
11495,"own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited,"
11496,thought I was a Muggle-born in hiding. I had to talk fast to get out
11497,of being dragged to the Ministry.”
11498,“What did you say to them?”
11499,“Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think
11500,of.”
11501,“And they believed that?”
11502,"“They weren’t the brightest. One of them was definitely part troll,"
11503,the smell off him. . . .”
11504,"Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this"
11505,"small instance of humor, but her expression remained stony above"
11506,her tightly knotted limbs.
11507,"“Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was"
11508,"a bit pathetic to be honest, but there were still five of them and only"
11509,one of me and they’d taken my wand. Then two of them got into a
11510,fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one
11511,"holding me in the stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke"
11512,"holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn’t do it so well, Splinched"
11513,myself again” — Ron held up his right hand to show two missing
11514,fingernails; Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly — “and I came
11515,out miles from where you were. By the time I got back to that bit of
11516,riverbank where we’d been . . . you’d gone.”
11517,"“Gosh, what a gripping story,” Hermione said in the lofty voice"
11518,she adopted when wishing to wound. “You must have been simply
11519,"terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric’s Hollow and, let’s think,"

11522,"what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who’s snake"
11523,"turned up, it nearly killed both of us, and then You-Know-Who"
11524,himself arrived and missed us by about a second.”
11525,"“What?” Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione"
11526,ignored him.
11527,"“Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings"
11528,"into perspective, doesn’t it?”"
11529,"“Hermione,” said Harry quietly, “Ron just saved my life.”"
11530,She appeared not to have heard him.
11531,"“One thing I would like to know, though,” she said, fixing her"
11532,eyes on a spot a foot over Ron’s head. “How exactly did you find
11533,"us tonight? That’s important. Once we know, we’ll be able to make"
11534,sure we’re not visited by anyone else we don’t want to see.”
11535,"Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans"
11536,pocket.
11537,“This.”
11538,She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.
11539,"“The Deluminator?” she asked, so surprised she forgot to look"
11540,cold and fierce.
11541,"“It doesn’t just turn the lights on and off,” said Ron. “I don’t"
11542,know how it works or why it happened then and not any other
11543,"time, because I’ve been wanting to come back ever since I left. But"
11544,I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and
11545,I heard . . . I heard you.”
11546,He was looking at Hermione.
11547,“You heard me on the radio?” she asked incredulously.
11548,"“No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice,” he held"
11549,"up the Deluminator again, “came out of this.”"
11550, 383  
11551,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11552,"“And what exactly did I say?” asked Hermione, her tone some-"
11553,where between skepticism and curiosity.
11554,“My name. ‘Ron.’ And you said . . . something about a
11555,wand. . . .”
11556,Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered: It
11557,had been the first time Ron’s name had been said aloud by either of
11558,them since the day he had left; Hermione had mentioned it when
11559,talking about repairing Harry’s wand.
11560,"“So I took it out,” Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, “and"
11561,"it didn’t seem different or anything, but I was sure I’d heard you. So"
11562,"I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but another light"
11563,appeared right outside the window.”
11564,"Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes"
11565,focused on something neither Harry nor Hermione could see.
11566,"“It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light"
11567,"you get around a Portkey, you know?”"
11568,"“Yeah,” said Harry and Hermione together automatically."
11569,"“I knew this was it,” said Ron. “I grabbed my stuff and packed it,"
11570,then I put on my rucksack and went out into the garden.
11571,"“The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and"
11572,when I came out it bobbed along a bit and I followed it behind the
11573,"shed and then it . . . well, it went inside me.”"
11574,"“Sorry?” said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly."
11575,"“It sort of floated toward me,” said Ron, illustrating the move-"
11576,"ment with his free index finger, “right to my chest, and then — it"
11577,"just went straight through. It was here,” he touched a point close"
11578,"to his heart, “I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me"
11579,"I knew what I was supposed to do, I knew it would take me where"
11580, 384  

11582,I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill.
11583,There was snow everywhere. . . .”
11584,"“We were there,” said Harry. “We spent two nights there, and the"
11585,second night I kept thinking I could hear someone moving around
11586,in the dark and calling out!”
11587,"“Yeah, well, that would’ve been me,” said Ron. “Your protective"
11588,"spells work, anyway, because I couldn’t see you and I couldn’t hear"
11589,"you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in my"
11590,sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you’d
11591,have to show yourselves when you packed up the tent.”
11592,"“No, actually,” said Hermione. “We’ve been Disapparating under"
11593,"the Invisibility Cloak as an extra precaution. And we left really early,"
11594,"because, as Harry says, we’d heard somebody blundering around.”"
11595,"“Well, I stayed on that hill all day,” said Ron. “I kept hoping you’d"
11596,appear. But when it started to get dark I knew I must have missed
11597,"you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came out"
11598,"and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these"
11599,"woods. I still couldn’t see you, so I just had to hope one of you would"
11600,"show yourselves in the end — and Harry did. Well, I saw the doe"
11601,"first, obviously.”"
11602,“You saw the what?” said Hermione sharply.
11603,"They explained what had happened, and as the story of the silver"
11604,"doe and the sword in the pool unfolded, Hermione frowned from"
11605,"one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to keep"
11606,her limbs locked together.
11607,“But it must have been a Patronus!” she said. “Couldn’t you see
11608,who was casting it? Didn’t you see anyone? And it led you to the
11609,sword! I can’t believe this! Then what happened?”
11610,  385   
11611,CHAPTER NINETEEN
11612,Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool
11613,and had waited for him to resurface; how he had realized that some-
11614,"thing was wrong, dived in, and saved Harry, then returned for the"
11615,"sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated,"
11616,and Harry cut in.
11617,“— and Ron stabbed it with the sword.”
11618,“And . . . and it went? Just like that?” she whispered.
11619,"“Well, it — it screamed,” said Harry with half a glance at Ron."
11620,“Here.”
11621,He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and
11622,examined its punctured windows.
11623,"Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield"
11624,Charm with a wave of Hermione’s wand and turned to Ron.
11625,“Did you just say you got away from the Snatchers with a spare
11626,wand?”
11627,"“What?” said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining"
11628,the locket. “Oh — oh yeah.”
11629,"He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short,"
11630,dark wand out of its pocket. “Here. I figured it’s always handy to
11631,have a backup.”
11632,"“You were right,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “Mine’s"
11633,broken.”
11634,"“You’re kidding?” Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got"
11635,"to her feet, and he looked apprehensive again."
11636,"Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag,"
11637,then climbed back into her bed and settled down without another

11673,Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione’s baleful
11674,"presence again, and under the pretense of scouring the bare hedges"
11675,"for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing exchange"
11676,of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of
11677,"his and Hermione’s various wanderings, right up to the full story"
11678,of what had happened at Godric’s Hollow; Ron was now filling
11679,Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizard-
11680,ing world during his weeks away.
11681,“. . . and how did you find out about the Taboo?” he asked Harry
11682,after explaining the many desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to
11683,evade the Ministry.
11684,“The what?”
11685,“You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who’s
11686,name!”
11687,"“Oh, yeah. Well, it’s just a bad habit we’ve slipped into,” said"
11688,Harry. “But I haven’t got a problem calling him V —”
11689,"“NO!” roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and"
11690,Hermione (nose buried in a book at the tent entrance) to scowl

11707,his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. “You don’t reckon
11708,Kingsley could have sent that doe?”
11709,"“His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?”"
11710,“Oh yeah . . .”

11712,Hermione.
11713,“Harry . . . you don’t reckon it could’ve been Dumbledore?”
11714,“Dumbledore what?”

11717,"corners of his eyes, “he had the real sword last, didn’t he?”"
11718,"Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the"
11719,longing behind the question. The idea that Dumbledore had man-

11721,have been inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head.
11722,"“Dumbledore’s dead,” he said. “I saw it happen, I saw the body."

11736,"“I dunno,” said Ron. “Sometimes I’ve thought, when I’ve been"

11752,slap in the face for everyone who thought he was such a good bloke.
11753,"I don’t know that it’s such a big deal, though. He was really young"
11754,when they —”
11755,"“Our age,” said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and"
11756,something in his face seemed to decide Ron against pursuing the
11757,subject.
11758,A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles.
11759,Harry took aim at it with the wand Ron had given him the previous
11760, 391   
11761,CHAPTER TWENTY
11762,"night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, and"
11763,had decided was made of blackthorn.
11764,“Engorgio.”
11765,"The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing slightly in the web. Harry"
11766,tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger.
11767,"“Stop that,” said Ron sharply. “I’m sorry I said Dumbledore was"
11768,"young, okay?”"
11769,Harry had forgotten Ron’s hatred of spiders.
11770,“Sorry — Reducio.”
11771,The spider did not shrink. Harry looked down at the blackthorn
11772,wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had
11773,seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix
11774,"wand. The new one felt intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody"
11775,else’s hand sewn to the end of his arm.
11776,"“You just need to practice,” said Hermione, who had approached"
11777,them noiselessly from behind and had stood watching anxiously as
11778,Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. “It’s all a matter of
11779,"confidence, Harry.”"
11780,He knew why she wanted it to be all right: She still felt guilty
11781,about breaking his wand. He bit back the retort that sprang to his
11782,"lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it made"
11783,"no difference, and he would have hers instead. Keen for them all"
11784,"to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermi-"
11785,"one a tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book"
11786,once more.
11787,"All three of them returned to the tent when darkness fell, and"
11788,"Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried to make"
11789,the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic
11790,still seemed clumsier and less powerful than it had done before.
11791, 392  
11792,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
11793,"Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, after many"
11794,"nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out"
11795,of his rucksack and started to try and tune it.
11796,"“There’s this one program,” he told Harry in a low voice, “that"
11797,tells the news like it really is. All the others are on You-Know-Who’s
11798,"side and are following the Ministry line, but this one . . . you wait"
11799,"till you hear it, it’s great. Only they can’t do it every night, they have"
11800,"to keep changing locations in case they’re raided, and you need a"
11801,"password to tune in. . . . Trouble is, I missed the last one. . . .”"
11802,"He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand, mut-"
11803,tering random words under his breath. He threw Hermione many
11804,"covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the no-"
11805,tice she took of him he might not have been there. For ten minutes
11806,"or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her"
11807,"book, and Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand."
11808,Finally Hermione climbed down from her bunk. Ron ceased his
11809,tapping at once.
11810,"“If it’s annoying you, I’ll stop!” he told Hermione nervously."
11811,"Hermione did not deign to respond, but approached Harry."
11812,"“We need to talk,” she said."
11813,He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life
11814,and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.
11815,“What?” he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that
11816,there was a chapter on him in there; he was not sure he felt up to
11817,hearing Rita’s version of his relationship with Dumbledore. Hermi-
11818,"one’s answer, however, was completely unexpected."
11819,“I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood.”
11820,He stared at her.
11821,“Sorry?”
11822,  393  
11823,CHAPTER TWENTY
11824,“Xenophilius Lovegood. Luna’s father. I want to go and talk to
11825,him!”
11826,“Er — why?”
11827,"She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, “It’s"
11828,"that mark, the mark in Beedle the Bard. Look at this!”"
11829,She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry’s
11830,unwilling eyes and he saw a photograph of the original letter that
11831,"Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore’s famil-"
11832,"iar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that"
11833,"Dumbledore really had written those words, that they had not been"
11834,Rita’s invention.
11835,"“The signature,” said Hermione. “Look at the signature, Harry!”"
11836,He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking
11837,"about, but, looking more closely with the aid of his lit wand, he saw"
11838,that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny version
11839,of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the
11840,Bard.
11841,"“Er — what are you — ?” said Ron tentatively, but Hermione"
11842,quelled him with a look and turned back to Harry.
11843,"“It keeps cropping up, doesn’t it?” she said. “I know Viktor said"
11844,"it was Grindelwald’s mark, but it was definitely on that old grave in"
11845,"Godric’s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long before"
11846,"Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can’t ask Dumble-"
11847,dore or Grindelwald what it means — I don’t even know whether
11848,Grindelwald’s still alive — but we can ask Mr. Lovegood. He was
11849,"wearing the symbol at the wedding. I’m sure this is important,"
11850,Harry!”
11851,"Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense,"
11852,"eager face and then out into the surrounding darkness, thinking."
11853, 394  
11854,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
11855,"After a long pause he said, “Hermione, we don’t need another God-"
11856,"ric’s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and —”"
11857,"“But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of"
11858,"Beedle the Bard, how do you know we’re not supposed to find out"
11859,about the sign?”
11860,“Here we go again!” Harry felt slightly exasperated. “We keep
11861,trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and
11862,clues —”
11863,"“The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,” piped up"
11864,"Ron. “I think Hermione’s right, I think we ought to go and see"
11865,Lovegood.”
11866,Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron’s sup-
11867,port of Hermione had little to do with a desire to know the meaning
11868,of the triangular rune.
11869,"“It won’t be like Godric’s Hollow,” Ron added, “Lovegood’s on"
11870,"your side, Harry, The Quibbler’s been for you all along, it keeps tell-"
11871,ing everyone they’ve got to help you!”
11872,“I’m sure this is important!” said Hermione earnestly.
11873,"“But don’t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me"
11874,about it before he died?”
11875,“Maybe . . . maybe it’s something you need to find out for your-
11876,"self,” said Hermione with a faint air of clutching at straws."
11877,"“Yeah,” said Ron sycophantically, “that makes sense.”"
11878,"“No, it doesn’t,” snapped Hermione, “but I still think we ought"
11879,"to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A symbol that links Dumbledore, Grin-"
11880,"delwald, and Godric’s Hollow? Harry, I’m sure we ought to know"
11881,about this!”
11882,"“I think we should vote on it,” said Ron. “Those in favor of going"
11883,to see Lovegood —”
11884, 395    
11885,CHAPTER TWENTY
11886,His hand flew into the air before Hermione’s. Her lips quivered
11887,suspiciously as she raised her own.
11888,"“Outvoted, Harry, sorry,” said Ron, clapping him on the back."
11889,"“Fine,” said Harry, half amused, half irritated. “Only, once we’ve"
11890,"seen Lovegood, let’s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we?"
11891,"Where do the Lovegoods live, anyway? Do either of you know?”"
11892,"“Yeah, they’re not far from my place,” said Ron. “I dunno exactly"
11893,"where, but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever"
11894,they mention them. Shouldn’t be hard to find.”
11895,"When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his"
11896,voice.
11897,“You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.”
11898,"“All’s fair in love and war,” said Ron brightly, “and this is a bit of"
11899,"both. Cheer up, it’s the Christmas holidays, Luna’ll be home!”"
11900,They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchpole
11901,from the breezy hillside to which they Disapparated next morning.
11902,From their high vantage point the village looked like a collection of
11903,toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth
11904,in the breaks between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking
11905,"toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing their eyes, but all they"
11906,"could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which"
11907,afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.
11908,"“It’s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,” said Ron."
11909,"“Well, it’s not like you haven’t just seen them. You were there for"
11910,"Christmas,” said Hermione coldly."
11911,“I wasn’t at the Burrow!” said Ron with an incredulous laugh.
11912,“Do you think I was going to go back there and tell them all I’d
11913,"walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would’ve been great"
11914,"about it. And Ginny, she’d have been really understanding.”"
11915, 396  
11916,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
11917,"“But where have you been, then?” asked Hermione, surprised."
11918,“Bill and Fleur’s new place. Shell Cottage. Bill’s always been de-
11919,cent to me. He — he wasn’t impressed when he heard what I’d
11920,"done, but he didn’t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry."
11921,None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he
11922,and Fleur weren’t going home for Christmas because they wanted
11923,"to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were married. I"
11924,don’t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina
11925,Warbeck.”
11926,Ron turned his back on the Burrow.
11927,"“Let’s try up here,” he said, leading the way over the top of the"
11928,hill.
11929,"They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione’s insistence,"
11930,hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak. The cluster of low hills ap-
11931,"peared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which"
11932,seemed deserted.
11933,"“Do you think it’s theirs, and they’ve gone away for Christmas?”"
11934,"said Hermione, peering through the window at a neat little kitchen"
11935,with geraniums on the windowsill. Ron snorted.
11936,"“Listen, I’ve got a feeling you’d be able to tell who lived there if"
11937,you looked through the Lovegoods’ window. Let’s try the next lot
11938,of hills.”
11939,So they Disapparated a few miles farther north.
11940,"“Aha!” shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes."
11941,"Ron was pointing upward, toward the top of the hill on which they"
11942,"had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose vertically"
11943,"against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging"
11944,"behind it in the afternoon sky. “That’s got to be Luna’s house, who"
11945,else would live in a place like that? It looks like a giant rook!”
11946,  397   
11947,CHAPTER TWENTY
11948,"“It’s nothing like a bird,” said Hermione, frowning at the tower."
11949,"“I was talking about a chess rook,” said Ron. “A castle to you.”"
11950,Ron’s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill
11951,"first. When Harry and Hermione caught up with him, panting and"
11952,"clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly."
11953,"“It’s theirs,” said Ron. “Look.”"
11954,Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broken-down
11955,"gate. The first read,"
11956,THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR: X. LOVEGOOD
11957,"the second,"
11958,PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE
11959,"the third,"
11960,KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS
11961,The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading
11962,"to the front door was overgrown with a variety of odd plants, includ-"
11963,ing a bush covered in the orange radishlike fruit Luna sometimes
11964,wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave
11965,"the wizened stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent"
11966,"with the wind, stripped of leaves but still heavy with berry-sized red"
11967,"fruits and bushy crowns of white-beaded mistletoe, stood sentinel"
11968,"on either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened,"
11969,hawklike head peered down at them from one of the branches.
11970,"“You’d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,” said Hermi-"
11971,"one. “It’s you Mr. Lovegood wants to help, not us.”"
11972,"He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the"
11973,"beaded bag. She then rapped three times on the thick black door,"
11974, 398  
11975,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
11976,which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped like
11977,an eagle.
11978,"Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there"
11979,"stood Xenophilius Lovegood, barefoot and wearing what appeared"
11980,to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was dirty
11981,and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and
11982,Fleur’s wedding by comparison.
11983,“What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?” he cried
11984,"in a high-pitched, querulous voice, looking first at Hermione, then"
11985,"at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open in a"
11986,"perfect, comical O."
11987,"“Hello, Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry, holding out his hand. “I’m"
11988,"Harry, Harry Potter.”"
11989,"Xenophilius did not take Harry’s hand, although the eye that was"
11990,not pointing inward at his nose slid straight to the scar on Harry’s
11991,forehead.
11992,“Would it be okay if we came in?” asked Harry. “There’s some-
11993,thing we’d like to ask you.”
11994,"“I . . . I’m not sure that’s advisable,” whispered Xenophilius."
11995,He swallowed and cast a quick look around the garden. “Rather a
11996,shock . . . My word . . . I . . . I’m afraid I don’t really think I ought
11997,to —”
11998,"“It won’t take long,” said Harry, slightly disappointed by this"
11999,less-than-warm welcome.
12000,"“I — oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!”"
12001,They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed
12002,the door shut behind them. They were standing in the most peculiar
12003,"kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly circular, so that"
12004,it felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved
12005,  399  
12006,CHAPTER TWENTY
12007,"to fit the walls — the stove, the sink, and the cupboards — and all"
12008,"of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and birds in bright pri-"
12009,"mary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna’s style: The effect,"
12010,"in such an enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming."
12011,"In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the"
12012,upper levels. There was a great deal of clattering and banging coming
12013,from overhead: Harry wondered what Luna could be doing.
12014,"“You’d better come up,” said Xenophilius, still looking extremely"
12015,"uncomfortable, and he led the way."
12016,The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and
12017,"workplace, and as such, was even more cluttered than the kitchen."
12018,"Though much smaller and entirely round, the room somewhat re-"
12019,sembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion
12020,that it had transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised
12021,of centuries of hidden objects. There were piles upon piles of books
12022,and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures
12023,"Harry did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung"
12024,from the ceiling.
12025,Luna was not there: The thing that was making such a racket
12026,was a wooden object covered in magically turning cogs and wheels.
12027,It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of
12028,"old shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-"
12029,"fashioned printing press, due to the fact that it was churning out"
12030,Quibblers.
12031,"“Excuse me,” said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the ma-"
12032,"chine, seized a grubby tablecloth from beneath an immense number"
12033,"of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and threw it"
12034,"over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He"
12035,then faced Harry.
12036, 400   
12037,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
12038,“Why have you come here?”
12039,"Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small"
12040,cry of shock.
12041,“Mr. Lovegood — what’s that?”
12042,"She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike"
12043,"that of a unicorn, which had been mounted on the wall, protruding"
12044,several feet into the room.
12045,"“It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xeno-"
12046,philius.
12047,“No it isn’t!” said Hermione.
12048,"“Hermione,” muttered Harry, embarrassed, “now’s not the"
12049,moment —”
12050,"“But Harry, it’s an Erumpent horn! It’s a Class B Tradeable"
12051,Material and it’s an extraordinarily dangerous thing to have in a
12052,house!”
12053,"“How d’you know it’s an Erumpent horn?” asked Ron, edging"
12054,"away from the horn as fast as he could, given the extreme clutter"
12055,of the room.
12056,“There’s a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them!
12057,"Mr. Lovegood, you need to get rid of it straightaway, don’t you know"
12058,it can explode at the slightest touch?”
12059,"“The Crumple-Horned Snorkack,” said Xenophilius very clearly,"
12060,"a mulish look upon his face, “is a shy and highly magical creature,"
12061,and its horn —”
12062,"“Mr. Lovegood, I recognize the grooved markings around the"
12063,"base, that’s an Erumpent horn and it’s incredibly dangerous — I"
12064,don’t know where you got it —”
12065,"“I bought it,” said Xenophilius dogmatically, “two weeks ago, from"
12066,a delightful young wizard who knew of my interest in the exquisite

12068,CHAPTER TWENTY
12069,"Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now,” he said, turning"
12070,"to Harry, “why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?”"
12071,"“We need some help,” said Harry, before Hermione could start"
12072,again.
12073,"“Ah,” said Xenophilius. “Help. Hmm.”"
12074,His good eye moved again to Harry’s scar. He seemed simultane-
12075,ously terrified and mesmerized.
12076,“Yes. The thing is . . . helping Harry Potter . . . rather danger-
12077,ous . . .”
12078,“Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty
12079,to help Harry?” said Ron. “In that magazine of yours?”
12080,"Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press,"
12081,still banging and clattering beneath the tablecloth.
12082,"“Er — yes, I have expressed that view. However —”"
12083,"“That’s for everyone else to do, not you personally?” said Ron."
12084,"Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting"
12085,between the three of them. Harry had the impression that he was
12086,undergoing some painful internal struggle.
12087,“Where’s Luna?” asked Hermione. “Let’s see what she thinks.”
12088,Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steeling himself. Finally he
12089,said in a shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing
12090,"press, “Luna is down at the stream, fishing for Freshwater Plimpies."
12091,"She . . . she will like to see you. I’ll go and call her and then — yes,"
12092,very well. I shall try to help you.”
12093,He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front
12094,door open and close. They looked at each other.
12095,"“Cowardly old wart,” said Ron. “Luna’s got ten times his guts.”"
12096,“He’s probably worried about what’ll happen to them if the Death
12097,"Eaters find out I was here,” said Harry."
12098, 402    
12099,XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD
12100,"“Well, I agree with Ron,” said Hermione. “Awful old hypocrite,"
12101,telling everyone else to help you and trying to worm out of it him-
12102,self. And for heaven’s sake keep away from that horn.”
12103,Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He
12104,"could see a stream, a thin, glittering ribbon lying far below them"
12105,at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past
12106,"the window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invis-"
12107,ible beyond another line of hills. Ginny was over there somewhere.
12108,They were closer to each other today than they had been since Bill
12109,"and Fleur’s wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing to-"
12110,"ward her now, thinking of her. He supposed he ought to be glad of"
12111,"it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, Xenophilius’s"
12112,attitude proved that.
12113,He turned away from the window and his gaze fell upon another
12114,"peculiar object standing upon the cluttered, curved sideboard: a"
12115,stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a most
12116,bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear
12117,trumpets curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue
12118,"wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran over the top of her head,"
12119,while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap
12120,around her forehead.
12121,"“Look at this,” said Harry."

12123,wedding.”
12124,"They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophil-"
12125,"ius had climbed back up the spiral staircase into the room, his thin"
12126,"legs now encased in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted"
12127,teacups and a steaming teapot.
12128,"“Ah, you have spotted my pet invention,” he said, shoving the"

12132,"“Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful Rowena"
12133,Ravenclaw. ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure!’ ”
12134,He indicated the objects like ear trumpets.
12135,“These are the Wrackspurt siphons — to remove all sources of
12136,"distraction from the thinker’s immediate area. Here,” he pointed out"
12137,"the tiny wings, “a billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of"
12138,"mind. Finally,” he pointed to the orange radish, “the Dirigible Plum,"
12139,so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.”
12140,"Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had man-"
12141,aged to balance precariously on one of the cluttered side tables.
12142,“May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?” said Xenophil-
12143,"ius. “We make it ourselves.” As he started to pour out the drink,"
12144,"which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, “Luna is"
12145,"down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here."
12146,"She ought not to be too long, she has caught nearly enough Plimp-"

12151,Mr. Potter?”
12152,"“Well,” said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encour-"
12153,"agingly, “it’s about that symbol you were wearing around your neck"
12154,"at Bill and Fleur’s wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered what it"
12155,meant.”
12156,Xenophilius raised his eyebrows.
12157,“Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?”

12162,H          arry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. Neither of
12163,them seemed to have understood what Xenophilius had
12164,said either.
12165,“The Deathly Hallows?”
12166,"“That’s right,” said Xenophilius. “You haven’t heard of them? I’m"
12167,"not surprised. Very, very few wizards believe. Witness that knuckle-"
12168,"headed young man at your brother’s wedding,” he nodded at Ron,"
12169,“who attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark
12170,wizard! Such ignorance. There is nothing Dark about the Hallows
12171,"— at least, not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to"
12172,"reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help"
12173,one with the Quest.”
12174,He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion
12175,and drank some.
12176,"“I’m sorry,” said Harry. “I still don’t really understand.”"
12177,"To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged:"

12180,"The stuff was quite disgusting, as though someone had liquidized"
12181,bogey-flavored Every Flavor Beans.
12182,"“Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows,” said Xeno-"
12183,"philius, smacking his lips in apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot"
12184,infusion.
12185,“But what are the Deathly Hallows?” asked Hermione.
12186,Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup.
12187,“I assume that you are all familiar with “The Tale of the Three
12188,Brothers’?”
12189,"Harry said, “No,” but Ron and Hermione both said, “Yes.” Xeno-"
12190,philius nodded gravely.
12191,"“Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with ‘The Tale of"
12192,the Three Brothers’ . . . I have a copy somewhere. . . .”
12193,"He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment"
12194,"and books, but Hermione said, “I’ve got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I’ve"
12195,got it right here.”
12196,"And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small,"
12197,beaded bag.
12198,"“The original?” inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nod-"

12200,way to make sure we all understand.”
12201,"“Er . . . all right,” said Hermione nervously. She opened the book,"
12202,and Harry saw that the symbol they were investigating headed the
12203,"top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read."
12204,"“ ‘There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely,"
12205,winding road at twilight —’ ”
12206,"“Midnight, our mum always told us,” said Ron, who had stretched"
12207,"out, arms behind his head, to listen. Hermione shot him a look of"
12208,annoyance.

12212,"“Sorry, I just think it’s a bit spookier if it’s midnight!” said Ron."
12213,"“Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives,” said"
12214,Harry before he could stop himself. Xenophilius did not seem to
12215,"be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window at the"
12216,"sky. “Go on, Hermione.”"
12217,"“ ‘In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and"
12218,"too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in"
12219,"the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a"
12220,bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it
12221,when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
12222,“ ‘And Death spoke to them —’”
12223,"“Sorry,” interjected Harry, “but Death spoke to them?”"
12224,"“It’s a fairy tale, Harry!”"
12225,"“Right, sorry. Go on.”"
12226,“ ‘And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated
12227,"out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But"
12228,Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers
12229,"upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having"
12230,been clever enough to evade him.
12231,"“ ‘So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand"
12232,more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels
12233,"for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So"
12234,"Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand"
12235,"from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother."
12236,"“ ‘Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that"
12237,"he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to"
12238,recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank
12239,"and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would"
12240,have the power to bring back the dead.
12241, 407   
12242,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
12243,“ ‘And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he
12244,would like. The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest
12245,"of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something"
12246,that would enable him to go forth from that place without being fol-
12247,"lowed by Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own"
12248,Cloak of Invisibility.’ ”
12249,“Death’s got an Invisibility Cloak?” Harry interrupted again.
12250,"“So he can sneak up on people,” said Ron. “Sometimes he gets"
12251,"bored of running at them, flapping his arms and shrieking . . . sorry,"
12252,Hermione.”
12253,“ ‘Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue
12254,"on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure"
12255,"they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts."
12256,"“ ‘In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination."
12257,"“ ‘The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a"
12258,"distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quar-"
12259,"rel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail"
12260,"to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor,"
12261,"the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the"
12262,"powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it"
12263,made him invincible.
12264,"“ ‘That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he"
12265,"lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good"
12266,"measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat."
12267,“ ‘And so Death took the first brother for his own.
12268,"“ ‘Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where"
12269,he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall

12275,"untimely death, appeared at once before him."
12276,"“ ‘Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though"
12277,"she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and"
12278,"suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing,"
12279,killed himself so as truly to join her.
12280,“ ‘And so Death took the second brother for his own.
12281,"“ ‘But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he"
12282,was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great
12283,age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility
12284,"and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and"
12285,"went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.’ ”"
12286,Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xeno-
12287,"philius seemed to realize that she had stopped reading, then he with-"
12288,"drew his gaze from the window and said, “Well, there you are.”"
12289,"“Sorry?” said Hermione, sounding confused."
12290,"“Those are the Deathly Hallows,” said Xenophilius."
12291,"He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled"
12292,a torn piece of parchment from between more books.
12293,"“The Elder Wand,” he said, and he drew a straight vertical line"
12294,"upon the parchment. “The Resurrection Stone,” he said, and he added"
12295,"a circle on top of the line. “The Cloak of Invisibility,” he finished, en-"
12296,"closing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbol that so"
12297,"intrigued Hermione. “Together,” he said, “the Deathly Hallows.”"
12298,“But there’s no mention of the words ‘Deathly Hallows’ in the
12299,"story,” said Hermione."
12300,"“Well, of course not,” said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. “That"
12301,"is a children’s tale, told to amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us"
12302, 409  
12303,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
12304,"who understand these matters, however, recognize that the ancient"
12305,"story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make"
12306,the possessor master of Death.”
12307,There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the
12308,window. Already the sun was low in the sky.
12309,"“Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon,” he said quietly."
12310,“When you say ‘master of Death’ —” said Ron.
12311,"“Master,” said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. “Conqueror."
12312,Vanquisher. Whichever term you prefer.”
12313,"“But then . . . do you mean . . .” said Hermione slowly, and Harry"
12314,could tell that she was trying to keep any trace of skepticism out of
12315,"her voice, “that you believe these objects — these Hallows — actu-"
12316,ally exist?”
12317,Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again.
12318,"“Well, of course.”"
12319,"“But,” said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting"
12320,"to crack, “Mr. Lovegood, how can you possibly believe — ?”"
12321,"“Luna has told me all about you, young lady,” said Xenophilius."
12322,"“You are, I gather, not unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow."
12323,Close-minded.”
12324,"“Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione,” said Ron,"
12325,nodding toward the ludicrous headdress. His voice shook with the
12326,strain of not laughing.
12327,"“Mr. Lovegood,” Hermione began again. “We all know that there"
12328,"are such things as Invisibility Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist."
12329,But —”
12330,"“Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss"
12331,"Granger! I mean to say, it is not a traveling cloak imbued with a Dis-"
12332,"illusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else woven"

12336,"from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the"
12337,years until it turns opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really
12338,"and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures"
12339,"eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter"
12340,what spells are cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like
12341,"that, Miss Granger?”"
12342,"Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again,"
12343,"looking more confused than ever. She, Harry, and Ron glanced"
12344,"at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the"
12345,same thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xeno-
12346,philius had just described was in the room with them at that very
12347,moment.
12348,"“Exactly,” said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in"
12349,reasoned argument. “None of you have ever seen such a thing. The
12350,"possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?”"
12351,He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged
12352,with the faintest trace of pink.
12353,"“All right,” said Hermione, disconcerted. “Say the Cloak existed"
12354,". . . what about the stone, Mr. Lovegood? The thing you call the"
12355,Resurrection Stone?”
12356,“What of it?”
12357,"“Well, how can that be real?”"
12358,"“Prove that it is not,” said Xenophilius."
12359,Hermione looked outraged.
12360,"“But that’s — I’m sorry, but that’s completely ridiculous! How"
12361,can I possibly prove it doesn’t exist? Do you expect me to get hold
12362,"of — of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you"
12363,could claim that anything’s real if the only basis for believing in it
12364,is that nobody’s proved it doesn’t exist!”

12367,"“Yes, you could,” said Xenophilius. “I am glad to see that you are"
12368,opening your mind a little.”
12369,"“So the Elder Wand,” said Harry quickly, before Hermione could"
12370,"retort, “you think that exists too?”"
12371,"“Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence,” said Xenophil-"
12372,"ius. “The Elder Wand is the Hallow that is most easily traced, be-"
12373,cause of the way in which it passes from hand to hand.”
12374,“Which is what?” asked Harry.
12375,“Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from
12376,"its previous owner, if he is to be truly master of it,” said Xenophil-"
12377,ius. “Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert the
12378,"Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot"
12379,"died in his own cellar after his son, Hereward, took the wand from"
12380,"him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from Barnabas"
12381,"Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand"
12382,is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history.”
12383,"Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius,"
12384,but she did not contradict him.
12385,“So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?” asked Ron.
12386,"“Alas, who knows?” said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the"
12387,window. “Who knows where the Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail
12388,goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them really
12389,"defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who"
12390,"may have defeated them? History, alas, does not tell us.”"
12391,"There was a pause. Finally Hermione asked stiffly, “Mr. Love-"
12392,"good, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the Deathly"
12393,Hallows?”
12394,Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry’s

12399,name before. . . .
12400,"“But you have been misleading me, young woman!” said Xeno-"
12401,"philius, now sitting up much straighter in his chair and goggling at"
12402,Hermione. “I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! Many of
12403,us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything — everything!
12404,— to do with the Hallows!”
12405,“Who are the Peverells?” asked Ron.
12406,"“That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric’s"
12407,"Hollow,” said Hermione, still watching Xenophilius. “Ignotus"
12408,Peverell.”
12409,"“Exactly!” said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedantically."
12410,“The sign of the Deathly Hallows on Ignotus’s grave is conclusive
12411,proof!”
12412,“Of what?” asked Ron.
12413,"“Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three"
12414,"Peverell brothers, Antioch, Cadmus, and Ignotus! That they were"
12415,the original owners of the Hallows!”
12416,"With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up"
12417,"the tray, and headed for the spiral staircase."
12418,"“You will stay for dinner?” he called, as he vanished downstairs"
12419,again. “Everybody always requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimpy
12420,soup.”
12421,"“Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo’s,”"
12422,said Ron under his breath.
12423,Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about
12424,in the kitchen downstairs before speaking.
12425,“What do you think?” he asked Hermione.
12426, 413    
12427,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
12428,"“Oh, Harry,” she said wearily, “it’s a pile of utter rubbish. This"
12429,can’t be what the sign really means. This must just be his weird take
12430,on it. What a waste of time.”
12431,“I s’pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snor-
12432,"kacks,” said Ron."
12433,“You don’t believe it either?” Harry asked him.
12434,"“Nah, that story’s just one of those things you tell kids to teach"
12435,"them lessons, isn’t it? ‘Don’t go looking for trouble, don’t pick fights,"
12436,don’t go messing around with stuff that’s best left alone! Just keep
12437,"your head down, mind your own business, and you’ll be okay’ Come"
12438,"to think of it,” Ron added, “maybe that story’s why elder wands are"
12439,supposed to be unlucky.”
12440,“What are you talking about?”
12441,"“One of those superstitions, isn’t it? ‘May-born witches will marry"
12442,"Muggles.’ ‘Jinx by twilight, undone by midnight.’ ‘Wand of elder,"
12443,never prosper.’ You must’ve heard them. My mum’s full of them.”
12444,"“Harry and I were raised by Muggles,” Hermione reminded him."
12445,“We were taught different superstitions.” She sighed deeply as a
12446,rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one good
12447,thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to
12448,have made her forget that she was annoyed at Ron. “I think you’re
12449,"right,” she told him. “It’s just a morality tale, it’s obvious which gift"
12450,"is best, which one you’d choose —”"
12451,"The three of them spoke at the same time; Hermione said, “the"
12452,"Cloak,” Ron said, “the wand,” and Harry said, “the stone.”"
12453,"They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused."
12454,"“You’re supposed to say the Cloak,” Ron told Hermione, “but you"
12455,wouldn’t need to be invisible if you had the wand. An unbeatable

12460,"“We’ve already got an Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry."
12461,"“And it’s helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn’t noticed!”"
12462,said Hermione. “Whereas the wand would be bound to attract
12463,trouble —”
12464,"“Only if you shouted about it,” argued Ron. “Only if you were"
12465,"prat enough to go dancing around, waving it over your head, and"
12466,"singing, ‘I’ve got an unbeatable wand, come and have a go if you"
12467,think you’re hard enough.’ As long as you kept your trap shut —”
12468,"“Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?” said Hermione, look-"
12469,"ing skeptical. “You know, the only true thing he said to us was that"
12470,there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for hundreds of
12471,years.”
12472,“There have?” asked Harry.
12473,Hermione looked exasperated: The expression was so endearingly
12474,familiar that Harry and Ron grinned at each other.
12475,"“The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under differ-"
12476,"ent names through the centuries, usually in the possession of some"
12477,Dark wizard who’s boasting about them. Professor Binns mentioned
12478,"some of them, but — oh, it’s all nonsense. Wands are only as pow-"
12479,erful as the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast
12480,that theirs are bigger and better than other people’s.”
12481,"“But how do you know,” said Harry, “that those wands — the"

12484,"“What, and they’re all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?”"
12485,said Ron.
12486,"Harry laughed: The strange idea that had occurred to him was,"
12487,"after all, ridiculous. His wand, he reminded himself, had been of"

12492,"if it had been unbeatable, how could it have been broken?"
12493,“So why would you take the stone?” Ron asked him.
12494,"“Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius . . ."

12496,Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled.
12497,"“But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn’t want to come"
12498,"back, would they?” said Harry, thinking about the tale they had"
12499,just heard. “I don’t suppose there have been loads of other sto-
12500,"ries about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?” he asked"
12501,Hermione.
12502,"“No,” she replied sadly. “I don’t think anyone except Mr. Love-"
12503,good could kid themselves that’s possible. Beedle probably took the
12504,"idea from the Sorcerer’s Stone; you know, instead of a stone to make"
12505,"you immortal, a stone to reverse death.”"
12506,The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger: It was some-
12507,thing like burning underpants. Harry wondered whether it would
12508,be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking to
12509,spare his feelings.
12510,"“What about the Cloak, though?” said Ron slowly. “Don’t you"
12511,"realize, he’s right? I’ve got so used to Harry’s Cloak and how good"
12512,"it is, I never stopped to think. I’ve never heard of one like Harry’s."
12513,It’s infallible. We’ve never been spotted under it —”
12514,"“Of course not — we’re invisible when we’re under it, Ron!”"
12515,"“But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they’re not ex-"
12516,"actly ten a Knut, you know, is true! It’s never occurred to me before,"
12517,but I’ve heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when they get
12518,"old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they’ve got holes in."

12522,"Harry’s was owned by his dad, so it’s not exactly new, is it, but it’s"
12523,just . . . perfect!”
12524,"“Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone . . .”"
12525,"As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only"
12526,"half listening. Reaching the spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to"
12527,the next level and was distracted at once. His own face was looking
12528,back at him from the ceiling of the room above.
12529,"After a moment’s bewilderment, he realized that it was not a mir-"
12530,"ror, but a painting. Curious, he began to climb the stairs."
12531,"“Harry, what are you doing? I don’t think you should look around"
12532,when he’s not here!”
12533,But Harry had already reached the next level.
12534,Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five beautifully
12535,"painted faces: Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They"
12536,"were not moving as the portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there"
12537,was a certain magic about them all the same: Harry thought they
12538,breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the
12539,"pictures, linking them together, but after examining them for a"
12540,"minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually one word,"
12541,repeated a thousand times in golden ink: friends . . . friends . . .
12542,friends . . .
12543,Harry felt a great rush of affection for Luna. He looked around
12544,"the room. There was a large photograph beside the bed, of a young"
12545,Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging.
12546,Luna looked rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had
12547,ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty. This struck Harry as
12548,slightly odd. He stared around.
12549,Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet was also thick with
12550, 417   
12551,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
12552,"dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar."
12553,"The bed had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept"
12554,"in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched over the nearest window,"
12555,across a bloodred sky.
12556,“What’s wrong?” Hermione asked as Harry descended the stair-
12557,"case, but before he could respond, Xenophilius reached the top of"
12558,"the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls."
12559,"“Mr. Lovegood,” said Harry. “Where’s Luna?”"
12560,“Excuse me?”
12561,“Where’s Luna?”
12562,Xenophilius halted on the top step.
12563,"“I — I’ve already told you. She is down at Bottom Bridge, fish-"
12564,ing for Plimpies.”
12565,“So why have you only laid that tray for four?”
12566,"Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only"
12567,"noise was the continued chugging of the printing press, and a slight"
12568,rattle from the tray as Xenophilius’s hands shook.
12569,"“I don’t think Luna’s been here for weeks,” said Harry. “Her"
12570,"clothes are gone, her bed hasn’t been slept in. Where is she? And"
12571,why do you keep looking out of the window?”
12572,Xenophilius dropped the tray: The bowls bounced and smashed.
12573,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione drew their wands: Xenophilius froze,"
12574,his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the printing
12575,press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming
12576,across the floor from underneath the tablecloth; the press fell silent
12577,at last.
12578,"Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines,"
12579,her wand still pointing at Mr. Lovegood.
12580,"“Harry, look at this.”"

12584,He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clut-
12585,"ter. The front of The Quibbler carried his own picture, emblazoned"
12586,with the words Undesirable Number One and captioned with
12587,the reward money.
12588,"“The Quibbler’s going for a new angle, then?” Harry asked coldly,"
12589,his mind working very fast. “Is that what you were doing when
12590,"you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to the"
12591,Ministry?”
12592,Xenophilius licked his lips.
12593,"“They took my Luna,” he whispered. “Because of what I’ve been"
12594,"writing. They took my Luna and I don’t know where she is, what"
12595,they’ve done to her. But they might give her back to me if I — if
12596,I —”
12597,“Hand over Harry?” Hermione finished for him.
12598,"“No deal,” said Ron flatly. “Get out of the way, we’re leaving.”"
12599,"Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back"
12600,into a dreadful leer.
12601,“They will be here at any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot
12602,lose Luna. You must not leave.”
12603,"He spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sud-"
12604,den vision of his mother doing the same thing in front of his crib.
12605,"“Don’t make us hurt you,” Harry said. “Get out of the way, Mr."
12606,Lovegood.”
12607,“HARRY!” Hermione screamed.
12608,Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three
12609,"of them looked away from him, Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry"
12610,"realized their mistake just in time: He launched himself sideways,"
12611,shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm’s way as Xenophilius’s Stun-
12612,ning Spell soared across the room and hit the Erumpent horn.
12613,  419  
12614,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
12615,There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it seemed to blow
12616,the room apart: Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in
12617,"all directions, along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust."
12618,"Harry flew through the air, then crashed to the floor, unable to see"
12619,"as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Her-"
12620,"mione’s scream, Ron’s yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds,"
12621,which told him that Xenophilius had been blasted off his feet and
12622,fallen backward down the spiral stairs.
12623,"Half buried in rubble, Harry tried to raise himself: He could"
12624,"barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fallen in, and"
12625,the end of Luna’s bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of
12626,"Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him with half its face missing, frag-"
12627,"ments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most"
12628,"of the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the stair-"
12629,"case to the kitchen. Then another white shape moved close by, and"
12630,"Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger"
12631,to her lips.
12632,The door downstairs crashed open.
12633,"“Didn’t I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?” said a rough"
12634,voice. “Didn’t I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?”
12635,There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius.
12636,“No . . . no . . . upstairs . . . Potter!”
12637,"“I told you last week, Lovegood, we weren’t coming back for any-"
12638,thing less than some solid information! Remember last week? When
12639,you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid bleeding head-
12640,"dress? And the week before” — another bang, another squeal —"
12641,“when you thought we’d give her back if you offered us proof there

12643,  420  
12644,THE TALE OF THE

12646,“No — no — I beg you!” sobbed Xenophilius. “It really is Pot-
12647,ter! Really!”
12648,“And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us
12649,"up!” roared the Death Eater, and there was a volley of bangs inter-"
12650,spersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius.
12651,"“The place looks like it’s about to fall in, Selwyn,” said a cool"
12652,"second voice, echoing up the mangled staircase. “The stairs are"
12653,completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place
12654,down.”
12655,"“You lying piece of filth,” shouted the wizard named Selwyn."
12656,"“You’ve never seen Potter in your life, have you? Thought you’d"
12657,"lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you’ll get your girl"
12658,back like this?”
12659,“I swear . . . I swear . . . Potter’s upstairs!”
12660,"“Homenum revelio,” said the voice at the foot of the stairs."
12661,"Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he had the odd sensation that"
12662,"something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its"
12663,shadow.
12664,"“There’s someone up there all right, Selwyn,” said the second"
12665,man sharply.
12666,"“It’s Potter, I tell you, it’s Potter!” sobbed Xenophilius. “Please . . ."
12667,"please . . . give me Luna, just let me have Luna. . . .”"
12668,"“You can have your little girl, Lovegood,” said Selwyn, “if you"
12669,get up those stairs and bring me down Harry Potter. But if this is
12670,"a plot, if it’s a trick, if you’ve got an accomplice waiting up there to"
12671,"ambush us, we’ll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you"
12672,to bury.”
12673,Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings
12674, 421    
12675,CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
12676,and scrapings: Xenophilius was trying to get through the debris on
12677,the stairs.
12678,"“Come on,” Harry whispered, “we’ve got to get out of here.”"
12679,He started to dig himself out under cover of all the noise Xeno-
12680,philius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried deepest: Harry
12681,"and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreck-"
12682,"age to where he lay, trying to prise a heavy chest of drawers off his"
12683,legs. While Xenophilius’s banging and scraping drew nearer and
12684,"nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover"
12685,Charm.
12686,"“All right,” breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press"
12687,blocking the top of the stairs began to tremble; Xenophilius was
12688,feet away from them. She was still white with dust. “Do you trust
12689,"me, Harry?”"
12690,Harry nodded.
12691,"“Okay then,” Hermione whispered, “give me the Invisibility"
12692,"Cloak. Ron, you’re going to put it on.”"
12693,“Me? But Harry —”
12694,"“Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron, grab my"
12695,shoulder.”
12696,Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak.
12697,The printing press blocking the stairs was vibrating: Xenophilius
12698,was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know
12699,what Hermione was waiting for.
12700,"“Hold tight,” she whispered. “Hold tight . . . any second . . .”"
12701,Xenophilius’s paper-white face appeared over the top of the
12702,sideboard.
12703,"“Obliviate!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand first into his"
12704,"face, then at the floor beneath them. “Deprimo!”"

12708,She had blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like
12709,"boulders, Harry still holding onto her hand for dear life; there was"
12710,"a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out"
12711,of the way as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained
12712,all around them from the shattered ceiling. Hermione twisted in
12713,midair and the thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry’s

12726,"“Cave Inimicum . . . Didn’t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn’t"

12730,"“Oh, I hope they don’t kill him!” groaned Hermione. “That’s why"
12731,"I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left,"

12739,“But what about your mum and dad?”
12740,"“They’re in Australia,” said Hermione. “They should be all right."
12741,They don’t know anything.”
12742,"“You’re a genius,” Ron repeated, looking awed."
12743,"“Yeah, you are, Hermione,” agreed Harry fervently. “I don’t know"
12744,what we’d do without you.”
12745,"She beamed, but became solemn at once."
12746,“What about Luna?”
12747,"“Well, if they’re telling the truth and she’s still alive —” began"
12748,Ron.
12749,"“Don’t say that, don’t say it!” squealed Hermione. “She must be"
12750,"alive, she must!”"
12751,"“Then she’ll be in Azkaban, I expect,” said Ron. “Whether she"
12752,"survives the place, though . . . Loads don’t. . . .”"
12753,"“She will,” said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the al-"

12755,probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.”
12756,"“I hope you’re right,” said Hermione. She passed a hand over her"

12758,"“— if he hadn’t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,”"
12759,said Ron.
12760,"They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made"

12770,"doesn’t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep"
12771,us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!”
12772,"“I don’t think so,” said Ron. “It’s a damn sight harder making"
12773,stuff up when you’re under stress than you’d think. I found that out
12774,when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be
12775,"Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new"
12776,"person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make"

12779,"“Well, I don’t suppose it matters,” sighed Hermione. “Even if he"
12780,"was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my"

12784,"“But the Deathly Hallows can’t exist, Ron!”"
12785,"“You keep saying that, but one of them can,” said Ron. “Harry’s"

12787,"“ ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers’ is a story,” said Hermione firmly."
12788,“A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving

12792,turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.

12799,what about the Resurrection Stone?” Her fingers sketched quotation
12800,"marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. “No magic"

12802,"“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my"

12806,truly bringing someone back to life.”
12807,"“But she, the girl in the tale, didn’t really come back, did she? The"
12808,"story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But"
12809,"the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn’t he? He"
12810,even lived with her for a while. . . .”
12811,He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione’s
12812,"expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was"
12813,fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people.
12814,"“So that Peverell bloke who’s buried in Godric’s Hollow,” he said"
12815,"hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, “you don’t know anything"
12816,"about him, then?”"
12817,"“No,” she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. “I"
12818,looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he’d been any-
12819,"one famous or done anything important, I’m sure he’d be in one of"
12820,our books. The only place I’ve managed to find the name ‘Peverell’
12821,is Nature’s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from
12822,"Kreacher,” she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. “It lists the"
12823,pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently
12824,the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.”
12825,“ ‘Extinct in the male line’?” repeated Ron.
12826,"“It means the name’s died out,” said Hermione, “centuries ago, in"
12827,  427   
12828,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
12829,"the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendants, though,"
12830,they’d just be called something different.”
12831,"And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that"
12832,had stirred at the sound of the name “Peverell”: a filthy old man
12833,"brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he"
12834,"cried aloud, “Marvolo Gaunt!”"
12835,“Sorry?” said Ron and Hermione together.
12836,“Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who’s grandfather! In the Pensieve!
12837,With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the
12838,Peverells!”
12839,Ron and Hermione looked bewildered.
12840,"“The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt"
12841,said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the
12842,"bloke from the Ministry’s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!”"
12843,“The Peverell coat of arms?” said Hermione sharply. “Could you
12844,see what it looked like?”
12845,"“Not really,” said Harry, trying to remember. “There was nothing"
12846,"fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only"
12847,ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.”
12848,Harry saw Hermione’s comprehension in the sudden widening of
12849,"her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished."
12850,“Blimey . . . You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the
12851,Hallows?”
12852,“Why not?” said Harry excitedly. “Marvolo Gaunt was an igno-
12853,"rant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry."
12854,"If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might"
12855,not have known what it really was. There were no books in that
12856,"house, and trust me, he wasn’t the type to read fairy tales to his kids."
12857,He’d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of

12860,"arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made"
12861,you practically royal.”
12862,"“Yes . . . and that’s all very interesting,” said Hermione cautiously,"
12863,"“but Harry, if you’re thinking what I think you’re think —”"
12864,"“Well, why not? Why not?” said Harry, abandoning caution. “It"
12865,"was a stone, wasn’t it?” He looked at Ron for support. “What if it"
12866,was the Resurrection Stone?”
12867,Ron’s mouth fell open.
12868,“Blimey — but would it still work if Dumbledore broke — ?”
12869,"“Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There’s no such thing as a"
12870,Resurrection Stone!”
12871,"Hermione had leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry."
12872,"“Harry, you’re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story —”"
12873,"“Fit everything in?” he repeated. “Hermione, it fits of its own ac-"
12874,cord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone!
12875,Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!”
12876,“A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone
12877,properly!”
12878,“Where d’you reckon the ring is now?” Ron asked Harry. “What
12879,did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?”
12880,"But Harry’s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and"
12881,Hermione’s. . . .
12882,"Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor"
12883,master of Death . . . Master . . . Conqueror . . . Vanquisher . . . The last
12884,enemy that shall be destroyed is death. . . .
12885,"And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Volde-"
12886,"mort, whose Horcruxes were no match . . . Neither can live while"
12887,the other survives. . . . Was this the answer? Hallows versus Hor-
12888,"cruxes? Was there a way, after all, to ensure that he was the one"

12890,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
12891,"who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows,"
12892,would he be safe?
12893,“Harry?”
12894,But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibil-
12895,"ity Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple"
12896,"as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in"
12897,his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was ex-
12898,actly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly
12899,"renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving"
12900,"constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast"
12901,at it. . . .
12902,"And then, with a gasp, he remembered —"
12903,“Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!”
12904,"His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did"
12905,not care.
12906,“My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This
12907,"is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third"
12908,Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric’s Hollow. . . .” Harry
12909,"was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new"
12910,vistas of truth were opening all around him. “He’s my ancestor! I’m
12911,descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!”
12912,"He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the"
12913,"mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt"
12914,joyous as he turned back to the other two.
12915,"“Harry,” said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the"
12916,"pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard."
12917,"“Read it,” he told her, pushing his mother’s letter into her hand."
12918,"“Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he"
12919,"want it? He didn’t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment"

12923,out one!”
12924,"Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair:"
12925,He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He
12926,"stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous"
12927,"discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted"
12928,inside him so that he shouted out.
12929,“IT’S IN HERE! He left me the ring — it’s in the Snitch!”
12930,“You — you reckon?”
12931,He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was
12932,"so obvious, so clear to Harry: Everything fit, everything. . . . His"
12933,"Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open"
12934,"the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do"
12935,"was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then —"
12936,But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excite-
12937,"ment, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and"
12938,"he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken."
12939,“That’s what he’s after.”
12940,The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even
12941,more scared.
12942,“You-Know-Who’s after the Elder Wand.”
12943,"He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew"
12944,it was the truth. It all made sense. Voldemort was not seeking a new
12945,"wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry"
12946,"walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Her-"
12947,"mione as he looked out into the night, thinking. . . ."
12948,Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody
12949,could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a
12950,"child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards"
12951, 431  
12952,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
12953,believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew
12954,about them?
12955,Harry gazed into the darkness. . . . If Voldemort had known
12956,"about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them,"
12957,done anything to possess them: three objects that made the pos-
12958,sessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hal-
12959,"lows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn’t"
12960,"the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a"
12961,"Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wiz-"
12962,arding secret?
12963,Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without
12964,"realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of"
12965,"three . . . for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden,"
12966,whose existence was best known. . . . The bloody trail of the Elder
12967,Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history . . .
12968,"Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver"
12969,sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with
12970,amazement at his discoveries.
12971,He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermi-
12972,"one standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding"
12973,"Lily’s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn’t they"
12974,realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?
12975,"“This is it,” Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his"
12976,own astonished certainty. “This explains everything. The Deathly
12977,"Hallows are real, and I’ve got one — maybe two —”"
12978,He held up the Snitch.
12979,"“— and You-Know-Who’s chasing the third, but he doesn’t real-"
12980,ize . . . he just thinks it’s a powerful wand —”
12981,"“Harry,” said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him"
12982, 432  
12983,THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
12984,"back Lily’s letter, “I’m sorry, but I think you’ve got this wrong, all"
12985,wrong.”
12986,“But don’t you see? It all fits —”
12987,"“No, it doesn’t,” she said. “It doesn’t, Harry, you’re just getting"
12988,"carried away. Please,” she said as he started to speak, “please just"
12989,"answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dum-"
12990,"bledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all"
12991,"three of them would be master of Death — Harry, why wouldn’t"
12992,he have told you? Why?”
12993,He had his answer ready.
12994,"“But you said it, Hermione! You’ve got to find out about them"
12995,for yourself! It’s a Quest!”
12996,“But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the
12997,Lovegoods’!” cried Hermione in exasperation. “I didn’t really be-
12998,lieve it!”
12999,Harry took no notice.
13000,“Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try
13001,"my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he’d do.”"
13002,"“Harry, this isn’t a game, this isn’t practice! This is the real thing,"
13003,and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy
13004,"the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn’t mean anything, forget the"
13005,"Deathly Hallows, we can’t afford to get sidetracked —”"
13006,Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over
13007,"and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the"
13008,"Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that"
13009,the Deathly Hallows were real.
13010,She appealed to Ron.
13011,"“You don’t believe in this, do you?”"
13012,Harry looked up. Ron hesitated.
13013,  433   
13014,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
13015,"“I dunno . . . I mean . . . bits of it sort of fit together,” said Ron"
13016,awkwardly. “But when you look at the whole thing . . .” He took a
13017,"deep breath. “I think we’re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry."
13018,That’s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe . . . maybe we should
13019,forget about this Hallows business.”
13020,"“Thank you, Ron,” said Hermione. “I’ll take first watch.”"
13021,"And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance,"
13022,bringing the action to a fierce full stop.
13023,But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hal-
13024,"lows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agi-"
13025,"tating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and"
13026,"the Cloak, if he could just possess them all. . . ."
13027,I open at the close. . . . But what was ‘the close’? Why couldn’t he
13028,"have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumble-"
13029,dore these questions in person . . . and Harry murmured words to
13030,"the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue,"
13031,but the golden ball would not open. . . .
13032,"And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where"
13033,was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn
13034,"and show him Voldemort’s thoughts, because for the first time ever,"
13035,he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing. . . .
13036,"Hermione would not like that idea, of course. . . . But then, she did"
13037,"not believe . . . Xenophilius had been right, in a way . . . Limited."
13038,Narrow. Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea
13039,"of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone . . ."
13040,"and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly"
13041,"swallowing it, but the cold metal did not yield. . . ."
13042,"It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in"
13043,"Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed"
13044, 434  
13045,THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
13046,of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contempla-
13047,tion of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her; but dementors
13048,in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came
13049,"to think about it, he had not yet tried casting a Patronus with the"
13050,blackthorn wand. . . . He must try that in the morning. . . .
13051,If only there was a way of getting a better wand . . .
13052,"And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, in-"
13053,"vincible, swallowed him once more. . . ."
13054,They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through
13055,"a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast,"
13056,"where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the"
13057,"whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and"
13058,depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as
13059,"though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione’s"
13060,"flat disbelief nor Ron’s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet"
13061,"the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less"
13062,joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their deter-
13063,mined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening
13064,"his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained"
13065,absolute. Harry’s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed
13066,him so much that he felt quite isolated from the other two and their
13067,obsession with the Horcruxes.
13068,"“Obsession?” said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry"
13069,"was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione"
13070,had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes.
13071,"“We’re not the ones with an obsession, Harry! We’re the ones trying"
13072,to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!”
13073,But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore
13074,"had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he"
13075, 435   
13076,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
13077,"had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection"
13078,Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other
13079,survives. . . . master of Death . . . Why didn’t Ron and Hermione
13080,understand?
13081,"“ ‘The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death,’ ” Harry quoted"
13082,calmly.
13083,“I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fight-
13084,"ing?” Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her."
13085,"Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on"
13086,"discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting"
13087,sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar
13088,"had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this"
13089,"fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened,"
13090,but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort
13091,"were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shift-"
13092,ing as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just
13093,able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like
13094,"a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than"
13095,"substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted"
13096,by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself
13097,"and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared"
13098,"and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry con-"
13099,"nected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his"
13100,"wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand’s fault that he could no longer"
13101,see into Voldemort’s mind as well as before.
13102,"As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even"
13103,"through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking"
13104,charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having
13105,  436  
13106,THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
13107,"walked out on them, perhaps because Harry’s descent into listless-"
13108,"ness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one"
13109,now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.
13110,"“Three Horcruxes left,” he kept saying. “We need a plan of ac-"
13111,"tion, come on! Where haven’t we looked? Let’s go through it again."
13112,The orphanage . . .”
13113,"Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes,"
13114,"Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or"
13115,"worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them"
13116,"again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He"
13117,"would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Volde-"
13118,"mort’s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron"
13119,"insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry"
13120,"was aware, to keep them moving."
13121,"“You never know,” was Ron’s constant refrain. “Upper Flagley is"
13122,"a Wizarding village, he might’ve wanted to live there. Let’s go and"
13123,have a poke around.”
13124,These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them
13125,within occasional sight of Snatchers.
13126,"“Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,” said"
13127,"Ron. “The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some"
13128,of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch —”
13129,“On what?” said Harry.
13130,"“Potterwatch, didn’t I tell you that’s what it was called? The pro-"
13131,"gram I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the"
13132,truth about what’s going on! Nearly all the programs are following
13133,"You-Know-Who’s line, all except Potterwatch. I really want you to"
13134,"hear it, but it’s tricky tuning in. . . .”"
13135, 437     
13136,CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
13137,Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out vari-
13138,ous rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occa-
13139,sionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragon
13140,"pox, and once a few bars of “A Cauldron Full of Hot Strong Love.”"
13141,"While he tapped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct pass-"
13142,"word, muttering strings of random words under his breath."
13143,"“They’re normally something to do with the Order,” he told them."
13144,“Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I’m bound to get one in
13145,the end. . . .”
13146,But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting
13147,"in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape"
13148,"hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when"
13149,Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent.
13150,"“I’ve got it, I’ve got it! Password was ‘Albus’! Get in here, Harry!”"
13151,Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the
13152,"Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron"
13153,and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermi-
13154,"one, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for some-"
13155,"thing to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker,"
13156,from which a most familiar voice was issuing.
13157,"“. . . apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves,"
13158,which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those
13159,charming Death Eaters.”
13160,“But that’s Lee Jordan!” said Hermione.
13161,"“I know!” beamed Ron. “Cool, eh?”"
13162,"“. . . now found ourselves another secure location,” Lee was say-"
13163,"ing, “and I’m pleased to tell you that two of our regular"
13164,"contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!”"
13165,“Hi.”

13167,THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
13168,"“Evening, River.”"
13169,"“ ‘River,’ that’s Lee,” Ron explained. “They’ve all got code names,"
13170,but you can usually tell —”
13171,“Shh!” said Hermione.
13172,"“But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,” Lee went on, “let’s"
13173,take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless
13174,Network News and Daily Prophet don’t think important enough to
13175,mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the
13176,murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.”
13177,"Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione"
13178,gazed at one another in horror.
13179,“A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed
13180,"that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both be-"
13181,"lieved to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gor-"
13182,"nuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any"
13183,"knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate"
13184,for news.
13185,"“Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found"
13186,dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths
13187,"to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me"
13188,"that it was the Killing Curse — more evidence, as if it were needed,"
13189,of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a
13190,recreational sport under the new regime.
13191,"“Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of"
13192,Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric’s Hollow. The
13193,evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoe-
13194,nix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries
13195,inflicted by Dark Magic.

13200,"Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered"
13201,by the Death Eaters.”
13202,"Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half"
13203,"of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might"
13204,come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the
13205,outside world for a long time.
13206,"“Thank you,” said Lee’s voice. “And now we turn to regular con-"
13207,"tributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is"
13208,affecting the Muggle world.”
13209,"“Thanks, River,” said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured,"
13210,reassuring.
13211,“Kingsley!” burst out Ron.
13212,"“We know!” said Hermione, hushing him."
13213,“Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as
13214,"they continue to sustain heavy casualties,” said Kingsley. “However,"
13215,we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches
13216,"risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors,"
13217,often without the Muggles’ knowledge. I’d like to appeal to all our
13218,"listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective"
13219,charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could
13220,be saved if such simple measures are taken.”
13221,"“And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that"
13222,"in these dangerous times, it should be ‘Wizards first’?” asked Lee."
13223,“I’d say that it’s one short step from ‘Wizards first’ to ‘Purebloods
13224,"first,’ and then to ‘Death Eaters,’ ” replied Kingsley. “We’re all hu-"

13231,Romulus for our popular feature ‘Pals of Potter.’ ”
13232,"“Thanks, River,” said another very familiar voice; Ron started to"
13233,"speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper."
13234,“We know it’s Lupin!”
13235,"“Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you’ve ap-"
13236,"peared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?”"
13237,"“I do,” said Lupin firmly. “There is no doubt at all in my mind"
13238,that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the
13239,"Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly"
13240,blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. ‘The Boy Who
13241,Lived’ remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting:
13242,"the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep"
13243,resisting.”
13244,A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin
13245,"forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they"
13246,had last met?
13247,"“And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening,"
13248,Romulus?”
13249,"“I’d tell him we’re all with him in spirit,” said Lupin, then hesi-"
13250,"tated slightly. “And I’d tell him to follow his instincts, which are"
13251,good and nearly always right.”
13252,"Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears."
13253,"“Nearly always right,” she repeated."
13254,"“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” said Ron in surprise. “Bill told me Lupin’s"
13255,living with Tonks again! And apparently she’s getting pretty big
13256,too. . . .”

13264,Lupin.
13265,“At least he’s still alive!” muttered Ron.
13266,“We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus
13267,"Hagrid” — all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest"
13268,"of the sentence — “well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School,"
13269,"has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where"
13270,he is rumored to have hosted a ‘Support Harry Potter’ party in his
13271,"house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we"
13272,"believe, on the run.”"
13273,"“I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you’ve"
13274,got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?” asked Lee.
13275,"“It would tend to give you an edge,” agreed Lupin gravely. “May"
13276,"I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid’s spirit,"
13277,we would urge even the most devoted of Harry’s supporters against
13278,following Hagrid’s lead. ‘Support Harry Potter’ parties are unwise
13279,in the present climate.”
13280,"“Indeed they are, Romulus,” said Lee, “so we suggest that you"
13281,continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar
13282,by listening to Potterwatch! And now let’s move to news concerning
13283,the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like
13284,"to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views"
13285,"on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I’d like"
13286,to introduce a new correspondent: Rodent.”
13287,"“ ‘Rodent ’?” said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and"

13292,“No — is it George?”
13293,"“It’s Fred, I think,” said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin"
13294,"it was said,"
13295,"“I’m not being ‘Rodent,’ no way, I told you I wanted to be"
13296,‘Rapier’!”
13297,"“Oh, all right then. ‘Rapier,’ could you please give us your take"
13298,on the various stories we’ve been hearing about the Chief Death
13299,Eater?”
13300,"“Yes, River, I can,” said Fred. “As our listeners will know, unless"
13301,they’ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere
13302,"similar, You-Know-Who’s strategy of remaining in the shadows is"
13303,"creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged"
13304,"sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-"
13305,Know-Whos running around the place.”
13306,"“Which suits him, of course,” said Kingsley. “The air of mystery"
13307,is creating more terror than actually showing himself.”
13308,"“Agreed,” said Fred. “So, people, let’s try and calm down a bit."
13309,"Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance,"
13310,this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill with a single glance from
13311,"his eyes. That’s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether"
13312,"the thing that’s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it’s safe to look"
13313,"into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that’s still"
13314,likely to be the last thing you ever do.”
13315,"For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He"
13316,could feel the weight of tension leaving him.
13317,“And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?” asked
13318,Lee.
13319,"“Well, who wouldn’t want a nice little holiday after all the hard"

13324,"Maybe he is, maybe he isn’t, but the fact remains he can move faster"
13325,"than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to,"
13326,so don’t count on him being a long way away if you’re planning on
13327,"taking any risks. I never thought I’d hear myself say it, but safety"
13328,first!”
13329,"“Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,” said Lee."
13330,"“Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don’t"
13331,"know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure"
13332,we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will
13333,be ‘Mad-Eye.’ Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.”
13334,The radio’s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel
13335,"went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing"
13336,"familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had be-"

13338,people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long

13340,"“Good, eh?” said Ron happily."
13341,"“Brilliant,” said Harry."
13342,"“It’s so brave of them,” sighed Hermione admiringly. “If they"
13343,were found . . .”
13344,"“Well, they keep on the move, don’t they?” said Ron. “Like us.”"
13345,“But did you hear what Fred said?” asked Harry excitedly; now

13358,can’t say it anymore — we’ve got to put the protection back around

13360,"But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope"
13361,on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices
13362,"coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the De-"

13364,“Come out of there with your hands up!” came a rasping voice
13365,through the darkness. “We know you’re in there! You’ve got half a

13370,"H          arry looked around at the other two, now mere outlines"
13371,"in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her wand, not"
13372,"toward the outside, but into his face; there was a bang, a burst of"
13373,"white light, and he buckled in agony, unable to see. He could feel"
13374,his face swelling rapidly under his hands as heavy footfalls sur-
13375,rounded him.
13376,"“Get up, vermin.”"
13377,Unknown hands dragged Harry roughly off the ground. Before
13378,"he could stop them, someone had rummaged through his pockets"
13379,and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at his excruci-
13380,"atingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers,"
13381,"tight, swollen, and puffy as though he had suffered some violent"
13382,allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits through which
13383,he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the
13384,tent; all he could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five
13385,people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside too.

13387,MALFOY MANOR
13388,“Get — off — her!” Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable
13389,sound of knuckles hitting flesh: Ron grunted in pain and Hermione
13390,"screamed, “No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!”"
13391,“Your boyfriend’s going to have worse than that done to him if
13392,"he’s on my list,” said the horribly familiar, rasping voice. “Delicious"
13393,girl . . . What a treat . . . I do enjoy the softness of the skin. . . .”
13394,Harry’s stomach turned over. He knew who this was: Fenrir
13395,"Greyback, the werewolf who was permitted to wear Death Eater"
13396,robes in return for his hired savagery.
13397,“Search the tent!” said another voice.
13398,Harry was thrown facedown onto the ground. A thud told him
13399,that Ron had been cast down beside him. They could hear foot-
13400,steps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the tent
13401,as they searched.
13402,"“Now, let’s see who we’ve got,” said Greyback’s gloating voice"
13403,"from overhead, and Harry was rolled over onto his back. A beam"
13404,of wandlight fell into his face and Greyback laughed.
13405,“I’ll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What hap-
13406,"pened to you, ugly?”"
13407,Harry did not answer immediately.
13408,"“I said,” repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the"
13409,"diaphragm that made him double over in pain, “what happened"
13410,to you?”
13411,"“Stung,” Harry muttered. “Been stung.”"
13412,"“Yeah, looks like it,” said a second voice."
13413,“What’s your name?” snarled Greyback.
13414,"“Dudley,” said Harry."
13415,“And your first name?”
13416,“I — Vernon. Vernon Dudley.”

13419,"“Check the list, Scabior,” said Greyback, and Harry heard him"
13420,"move sideways to look down at Ron, instead. “And what about you,"
13421,ginger?”
13422,"“Stan Shunpike,” said Ron."
13423,"“Like ’ell you are,” said the man called Scabior. “We know Stan"
13424,"Shunpike, ’e’s put a bit of work our way.”"
13425,There was another thud.
13426,"“I’b Bardy,” said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was"
13427,full of blood. “Bardy Weadley.”
13428,“A Weasley?” rasped Greyback. “So you’re related to blood trai-
13429,"tors even if you’re not a Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little"
13430,friend . . .” The relish in his voice made Harry’s flesh crawl.
13431,"“Easy, Greyback,” said Scabior over the jeering of the others."
13432,"“Oh, I’m not going to bite just yet. We’ll see if she’s a bit quicker"
13433,"at remembering her name than Barny. Who are you, girly?”"
13434,"“Penelope Clearwater,” said Hermione. She sounded terrified,"
13435,but convincing.
13436,“What’s your blood status?”
13437,"“Half-blood,” said Hermione."
13438,"“Easy enough to check,” said Scabior. “But the ’ole lot of ’em look"
13439,like they could still be ’ogwarts age —”
13440,"“We’b lebt,” said Ron."
13441,"“Left, ’ave you, ginger?” said Scabior. “And you decided to go"
13442,"camping? And you thought, just for a laugh, you’d use the Dark"
13443,Lord’s name?”
13444,"“Nod a laugh,” said Ron. “Aggiden.”"
13445,“Accident?” There was more jeering laughter.

13451,“Doh.”
13452,"“Well, they don’t show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the"
13453,name’s been Tabooed. A few Order members have been tracked that
13454,way. We’ll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!”
13455,"Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way,"
13456,"pushed him down into a sitting position, then started binding him"
13457,"back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely"
13458,able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the
13459,"man tying them had walked away, Harry whispered to the other"
13460,prisoners.
13461,“Anyone still got a wand?”
13462,"“No,” said Ron and Hermione from either side of him."
13463,"“This is all my fault. I said the name, I’m sorry —”"
13464,“Harry?”
13465,"It was a new, but familiar, voice, and it came from directly behind"

13467,“Dean?”
13468,"“It is you! If they find out who they’ve got — ! They’re Snatchers,"
13469,they’re only looking for truants to sell for gold —”
13470,"“Not a bad little haul for one night,” Greyback was saying, as"
13471,a pair of hobnailed boots marched close by Harry and they heard
13472,"more crashes from inside the tent. “A Mudblood, a runaway goblin,"
13473,"and three truants. You checked their names on the list yet, Scabior?”"
13474,he roared.
13475,"“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley on ’ere, Greyback.”"

13479,"He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infini-"
13480,"tesimal gap left between his swollen eyelids, a face covered in mat-"
13481,"ted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and sores at"
13482,the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the
13483,"top of the tower where Dumbledore had died: of dirt, sweat, and"
13484,blood.
13485,"“So you aren’t wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list un-"

13487,"“Slytherin,” said Harry automatically."
13488,"“Funny ’ow they all thinks we wants to ’ear that,” jeered Scabior"
13489,out of the shadows. “But none of ’em can tell us where the com-
13490,mon room is.”
13491,"“It’s in the dungeons,” said Harry clearly. “You enter through the"
13492,"wall. It’s full of skulls and stuff and it’s under the lake, so the light’s"
13493,all green.”
13494,There was a short pause.

13501,the game was up in any case. “Department of Magical Accidents

13509,"“Well, well,” said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest"
13510,"note of trepidation in that callous voice, and knew that Greyback"
13511,was wondering whether he had indeed just attacked and bound the
13512,son of a Ministry official. Harry’s heart was pounding against the
13513,ropes around his ribs; he would not have been surprised to know
13514,"that Greyback could see it. “If you’re telling the truth, ugly, you’ve"
13515,got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect your father’ll
13516,reward us just for picking you up.”
13517,"“But,” said Harry, his mouth bone dry, “if you just let us —”"
13518,"“Hey!” came a shout from inside the tent. “Look at this, Grey-"
13519,back!”
13520,"A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint"
13521,of silver in the light of their wands. They had found Gryffindor’s
13522,sword.
13523,"“Ve-e-ry nice,” said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his"
13524,"companion. “Oh, very nice indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where"
13525,did you get something like this?”
13526,"“It’s my father’s,” Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too"
13527,dark for Greyback to see the name etched just below the hilt. “We
13528,borrowed it to cut firewood —”
13529,"“ ’ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet !”"
13530,"As Scabior said it, Harry’s scar, which was stretched tight across"
13531,"his distended forehead, burned savagely. More clearly than he could"
13532,"make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a grim"

13548,of Hermione.
13549,"“You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot"

13551,“It isn’t! It isn’t me!”
13552,Hermione’s terrified squeak was as good as a confession.
13553,"“ ‘. . . known to be traveling with Harry Potter,’ ” repeated Grey-"

13555,A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry’s scar was exquisitely
13556,"painful, but he struggled with all his strength against the pull of"
13557,Voldemort’s thoughts: It had never been so important to remain in
13558,his own right mind.
13559,"“Well, this changes things, doesn’t it?” whispered Greyback. No-"

13561,and felt Hermione’s arm trembling against his. Greyback got up and
13562,"took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to"
13563,stare closely at his misshapen features.
13564,"“What’s that on your forehead, Vernon?” he asked softly, his breath"
13565,foul in Harry’s nostrils as he pressed a filthy finger to the taut scar.

13573,And seconds later Harry’s glasses had been rammed back onto his

13575,“It is!” rasped Greyback. “We’ve caught Potter!”
13576,"They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had"

13590,"“Will you summon ’im? ’ere?” said Scabior, sounding awed,"

13594,Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Volde-

13596,"when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort’s inner circle"

13602,"— and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the window at"
13603,the very top of the tower —
13604,"“. . . completely sure it’s him? ’Cause if it ain’t, Greyback, we’re"
13605,dead.”
13606,"“Who’s in charge here?” roared Greyback, covering his moment"
13607,"of inadequacy. “I say that’s Potter, and him plus his wand, that’s two"
13608,hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you’re too gutless to
13609,"come along, any of you, it’s all for me, and with any luck, I’ll get"
13610,the girl thrown in!”
13611,"— The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough"
13612,"for a man to enter. . . . A skeletal figure was just visible through it,"
13613,"curled beneath a blanket. . . . Dead, or sleeping . . . ?"
13614,"“All right!” said Scabior. “All right, we’re in! And what about the"
13615,"rest of ’em, Greyback, what’ll we do with ’em?”"
13616,"“Might as well take the lot. We’ve got two Mudbloods, that’s"
13617,"another ten Galleons. Give me the sword as well. If they’re rubies,"
13618,that’s another small fortune right there.”
13619,The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Her-
13620,"mione’s breathing, fast and terrified."
13621,"“Grab hold and make it tight. I’ll do Potter!” said Greyback, seiz-"
13622,ing a fistful of Harry’s hair; Harry could feel his long yellow nails
13623,scratching his scalp. “On three! One — two — three —”
13624,"They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry strug-"
13625,"gled, trying to throw off Greyback’s hand, but it was hopeless: Ron"
13626,"and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on either side, he"
13627,"could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed"
13628,out of him his scar seared more painfully still —
13629, 454   
13630,MALFOY MANOR
13631,— as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and
13632,"landed, lightly as vapor, inside the cell-like room —"
13633,The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a coun-
13634,"try lane. Harry’s eyes, still puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then"
13635,he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what looked like a
13636,long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had
13637,"not happened yet: Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew,"
13638,"for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some strange, fortresslike"
13639,"place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to"
13640,"get to this place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another"
13641,matter. . . .
13642,One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.
13643,"“How do we get in? They’re locked, Greyback, I can’t —"
13644,blimey!”
13645,"He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting,"
13646,twisting itself out of the abstract furls and coils into a frighten-
13647,"ing face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice: “State your"
13648,purpose!”
13649,“We’ve got Potter!” Greyback roared triumphantly. “We’ve cap-
13650,tured Harry Potter!”
13651,The gates swung open.
13652,"“Come on!” said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were"
13653,"shunted through the gates and up the drive, between high hedges"
13654,that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above
13655,"him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was"
13656,dragged onto his feet by Greyback; now he was staggering along
13657,"sideways, tied back-to-back to the four other prisoners. Closing his"
13658,"puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his scar to overcome him for a"
13659, 455   
13660,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
13661,"moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he"
13662,knew yet that Harry was caught. . . .
13663,The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over
13664,"toward him, eyes opening in a skull of a face. . . . The frail man sat up,"
13665,"great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and then he smiled."
13666,Most of his teeth were gone. . . .
13667,"“So, you have come. I thought you would . . . one day. But your"
13668,journey was pointless. I never had it.”
13669,“You lie!”
13670,"As Voldemort’s anger throbbed inside him, Harry’s scar threat-"
13671,"ened to burst with pain, and he wrenched his mind back to his"
13672,"own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed"
13673,over gravel.
13674,Light spilled out over all of them.
13675,“What is this?” said a woman’s cold voice.
13676,“We’re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” rasped Grey-
13677,back.
13678,“Who are you?”
13679,“You know me!” There was resentment in the werewolf ’s voice.
13680,“Fenrir Greyback! We’ve caught Harry Potter!”
13681,"Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light,"
13682,forcing the other prisoners to shuffle around too.
13683,"“I know ’e’s swollen, ma’am, but it’s ’im!” piped up Scabior. “If"
13684,"you look a bit closer, you’ll see ’is scar. And this ’ere, see the girl? The"
13685,"Mudblood who’s been traveling around with ’im, ma’am. There’s no"
13686,"doubt it’s ’im, and we’ve got ’is wand as well! ’Ere, ma’am —”"
13687,Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutiniz-
13688,ing his swollen face. Scabior thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She
13689,raised her eyebrows.
13690,  456    
13691,MALFOY MANOR
13692,"“Bring them in,” she said."
13693,Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone
13694,steps into a hallway lined with portraits.
13695,"“Follow me,” said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. “My"
13696,"son, Draco, is home for his Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter,"
13697,he will know.”
13698,The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with
13699,his eyes almost closed Harry could make out the wide proportions
13700,"of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more por-"
13701,traits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in
13702,front of an ornate marble fireplace as the prisoners were forced into
13703,the room by the Snatchers.
13704,“What is this?”
13705,"The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on"
13706,"Harry’s ears. He was panicking now: He could see no way out, and"
13707,"it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out Voldemort’s thoughts,"
13708,though his scar was still burning.
13709,"“They say they’ve got Potter,” said Narcissa’s cold voice. “Draco,"
13710,come here.”
13711,"Harry did not dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely:"
13712,"a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from an armchair, his face"
13713,a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.
13714,Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry
13715,directly beneath the chandelier.
13716,"“Well, boy?” rasped the werewolf."
13717,"Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing"
13718,in an intricately scrolled frame. Through the slits of his eyes he
13719,saw his own reflection for the first time since leaving Grimmauld
13720,Place.
13721, 457   
13722,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
13723,"His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by"
13724,Hermione’s jinx. His black hair reached his shoulders and there
13725,was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was
13726,"he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing"
13727,"his glasses. He resolved not to speak, for his voice was sure to give"
13728,him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the latter
13729,approached.
13730,"“Well, Draco?” said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. “Is it? Is"
13731,it Harry Potter?”
13732,"“I can’t — I can’t be sure,” said Draco. He was keeping his dis-"
13733,"tance from Greyback, and seemed as scared of looking at Harry as"
13734,Harry was of looking at him.
13735,"“But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!”"
13736,Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.
13737,"“Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord,"
13738,everything will be forgiv —”
13739,"“Now, we won’t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope,"
13740,Mr. Malfoy?” said Greyback menacingly.
13741,"“Of course not, of course not!” said Lucius impatiently. He ap-"
13742,"proached Harry himself, came so close that Harry could see the"
13743,"usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen"
13744,"eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peer-"
13745,ing out from between the bars of a cage.
13746,“What did you do to him?” Lucius asked Greyback. “How did
13747,he get into this state?”
13748,“That wasn’t us.”
13749,"“Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,” said Lucius."
13750,His gray eyes raked Harry’s forehead.
13751,"“There’s something there,” he whispered, “it could be the scar,"
13752, 458  
13753,MALFOY MANOR
13754,"stretched tight. . . . Draco, come here, look properly! What do you"
13755,think?”
13756,"Harry saw Draco’s face up close now, right beside his father’s."
13757,"They were extraordinarily alike, except that while his father looked"
13758,"beside himself with excitement, Draco’s expression was full of re-"
13759,"luctance, even fear."
13760,"“I don’t know,” he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace"
13761,where his mother stood watching.
13762,"“We had better be certain, Lucius,” Narcissa called to her hus-"
13763,"band in her cold, clear voice. “Completely sure that it is Potter,"
13764,before we summon the Dark Lord . . . They say this is his” — she
13765,was looking closely at the blackthorn wand — “but it does not re-
13766,"semble Ollivander’s description. . . . If we are mistaken, if we call the"
13767,Dark Lord here for nothing . . . Remember what he did to Rowle
13768,and Dolohov?”
13769,"“What about the Mudblood, then?” growled Greyback. Harry"
13770,was nearly thrown off his feet as the Snatchers forced the prisoners
13771,"to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione instead."
13772,"“Wait,” said Narcissa sharply. “Yes — yes, she was in Madam"
13773,"Malkin’s with Potter! I saw her picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco,"
13774,isn’t it the Granger girl?”
13775,“I . . . maybe . . . yeah.”
13776,"“But then, that’s the Weasley boy!” shouted Lucius, strid-"
13777,"ing around the bound prisoners to face Ron. “It’s them, Potter’s"
13778,"friends — Draco, look at him, isn’t it Arthur Weasley’s son, what’s"
13779,his name — ?”
13780,"“Yeah,” said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. “It could"
13781,be.”
13782,"The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke,"
13783, 459   
13784,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
13785,and the sound of the voice wound Harry’s fear to an even higher
13786,pitch.
13787,"“What is this? What’s happened, Cissy?”"
13788,"Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and"
13789,"stopped on Harry’s right, staring at Hermione through her heavily"
13790,lidded eyes.
13791,"“But surely,” she said quietly, “this is the Mudblood girl? This is"
13792,Granger?”
13793,"“Yes, yes, it’s Granger!” cried Lucius. “And beside her, we think,"
13794,"Potter! Potter and his friends, caught at last!”"
13795,"“Potter?” shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to"
13796,"take in Harry. “Are you sure? Well then, the Dark Lord must be"
13797,informed at once!”
13798,She dragged back her left sleeve: Harry saw the Dark Mark
13799,"burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to"
13800,"touch it, to summon her beloved master —"
13801,"“I was about to call him!” said Lucius, and his hand actually"
13802,"closed upon Bellatrix’s wrist, preventing her from touching the"
13803,"Mark. “I shall summon him, Bella, Potter has been brought to my"
13804,"house, and it is therefore upon my authority —”"
13805,"“Your authority!” she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand"
13806,"from his grasp. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand,"
13807,Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!”
13808,"“This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the"
13809,boy —”
13810,"“Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,” interjected Greyback,"
13811,"“but it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the"
13812,gold —”
13813,"“Gold!” laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her"
13814,  460  
13815,MALFOY MANOR
13816,"brother-in-law, her free hand groping in her pocket for her wand."
13817,"“Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I seek"
13818,only the honor of his — of —”
13819,"She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something"
13820,"Harry could not see. Jubilant at her capitulation, Lucius threw her"
13821,hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve —
13822,"“STOP!” shrieked Bellatrix. “Do not touch it, we shall all perish"
13823,if the Dark Lord comes now!”
13824,"Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bel-"
13825,latrix strode out of Harry’s limited line of vision.
13826,“What is that?” he heard her say.
13827,"“Sword,” grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher."
13828,“Give it to me.”
13829,"“It’s not yorn, missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it.”"
13830,There was a bang and a flash of red light: Harry knew that the
13831,Snatcher had been Stunned. There was a roar of anger from his fel-
13832,lows: Scabior drew his wand.
13833,"“What d’you think you’re playing at, woman?”"
13834,“Stupefy!” she screamed. “Stupefy!”
13835,"They were no match for her, even though there were four of them"
13836,"against one of her: She was a witch, as Harry knew, with prodi-"
13837,"gious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all except"
13838,"Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms"
13839,outstretched. Out of the corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix
13840,"bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor gripped"
13841,"tightly in her hand, her face waxen."
13842,“Where did you get this sword?” she whispered to Greyback as
13843,she pulled his wand out of his unresisting grip.
13844,"“How dare you?” he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could"
13845, 461   
13846,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
13847,move as he was forced to gaze up at her. He bared his pointed teeth.
13848,"“Release me, woman!”"
13849,"“Where did you find this sword?” she repeated, brandishing it in"
13850,his face. “Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts!”
13851,"“It was in their tent,” rasped Greyback. “Release me, I say!”"
13852,"She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but ap-"
13853,"peared too wary to approach her. He prowled behind an armchair,"
13854,his filthy curved nails clutching its back.
13855,"“Draco, move this scum outside,” said Bellatrix, indicating the"
13856,"unconscious men. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then"
13857,leave them in the courtyard for me.”
13858,"“Don’t you dare speak to Draco like —” said Narcissa furiously,"
13859,"but Bellatrix screamed,"
13860,"“Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine,"
13861,Cissy! We have a very serious problem!”
13862,"She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examin-"
13863,ing its hilt. Then she turned to look at the silent prisoners.
13864,"“If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,” she muttered,"
13865,more to herself than to the others. “The Dark Lord wishes to dis-
13866,pose of Potter himself. . . . But if he finds out . . . I must . . . I must
13867,know. . . .”
13868,She turned back to her sister again.
13869,"“The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what"
13870,to do!”
13871,"“This is my house, Bella, you don’t give orders in my —”"
13872,“Do it! You have no idea of the danger we are in!” shrieked Bel-
13873,"latrix. She looked frightening, mad; a thin stream of fire issued from"
13874,her wand and burned a hole in the carpet.
13875,"Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf."
13876, 462    
13877,MALFOY MANOR
13878,"“Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.”"
13879,"“Wait,” said Bellatrix sharply. “All except . . . except for the"
13880,Mudblood.”
13881,Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure.
13882,"“No!” shouted Ron. “You can have me, keep me!”"
13883,Bellatrix hit him across the face; the blow echoed around the
13884,room.
13885,"“If she dies under questioning, I’ll take you next,” she said. “Blood"
13886,"traitor is next to Mudblood in my book. Take them downstairs,"
13887,"Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more to"
13888,them — yet.”
13889,"She threw Greyback’s wand back to him, then took a short silver"
13890,knife from under her robes. She cut Hermione free from the other
13891,"prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the room,"
13892,while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another
13893,"door, into a dark passageway, his wand held out in front of him,"
13894,projecting an invisible and irresistible force.
13895,“Reckon she’ll let me have a bit of the girl when she’s finished
13896,with her?” Greyback crooned as he forced them along the corridor.
13897,"“I’d say I’ll get a bite or two, wouldn’t you, ginger?”"
13898,Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep
13899,"flight of stairs, still tied back-to-back and in danger of slipping and"
13900,breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy
13901,"door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced"
13902,them into a dank and musty room and left them in total darkness.
13903,The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away
13904,"before there was a terrible, drawn-out scream from directly above"
13905,them.
13906,"“HERMIONE!” Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and"
13907, 463  
13908,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
13909,"struggle against the ropes tying them together, so that Harry stag-"
13910,gered. “HERMIONE!”
13911,"“Be quiet!” Harry said. “Shut up, Ron, we need to work out a"
13912,way —”
13913,“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”
13914,"“We need a plan, stop yelling — we need to get these ropes"
13915,off —”
13916,“Harry?” came a whisper through the darkness. “Ron? Is that
13917,you?”
13918,Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by
13919,"them, then Harry saw a shadow moving closer."
13920,“Harry? Ron?”
13921,“Luna?”
13922,"“Yes, it’s me! Oh no, I didn’t want you to be caught!”"
13923,"“Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?” said Harry."
13924,"“Oh yes, I expect so. . . . There’s an old nail we use if we need to"
13925,break anything. . . . Just a moment . . .”
13926,"Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear"
13927,"Bellatrix screaming too, but her words were inaudible, for Ron"
13928,"shouted again, “HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”"
13929,“Mr. Ollivander?” Harry could hear Luna saying. “Mr. Olli-
13930,"vander, have you got the nail? If you just move over a little bit. . ."
13931,I think it was beside the water jug. . . .”
13932,She was back within seconds.
13933,"“You’ll need to stay still,” she said."
13934,Harry could feel her digging at the rope’s tough fibers to work
13935,the knots free. From upstairs they heard Bellatrix’s voice.
13936,“I’m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword?
13937,Where?”
13938, 464   
13939,MALFOY MANOR
13940,“We found it — we found it — PLEASE!” Hermione screamed
13941,"again; Ron struggled harder than ever, and the rusty nail slipped"
13942,onto Harry’s wrist.
13943,"“Ron, please stay still!” Luna whispered. “I can’t see what I’m"
13944,doing —”
13945,"“My pocket!” said Ron. “In my pocket, there’s a Deluminator,"
13946,and it’s full of light!”
13947,"A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres"
13948,the Deluminator had sucked from the lamps in the tent flew into
13949,"the cellar: Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung there,"
13950,"like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry"
13951,"saw Luna, all eyes in her white face, and the motionless figure of"
13952,"Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the corner."
13953,"Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners: Dean and"
13954,"Griphook the goblin, who seemed barely conscious, kept standing"
13955,by the ropes that bound him to the humans.
13956,"“Oh, that’s much easier, thanks, Ron,” said Luna, and she began"
13957,"hacking at their bindings again. “Hello, Dean!”"
13958,From above came Bellatrix’s voice.
13959,"“You are lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been"
13960,"inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell the truth, tell the truth!”"
13961,Another terrible scream —
13962,“HERMIONE!”
13963,“What else did you take? What else have you got? Tell me the
13964,"truth or, I swear, I shall run you through with this knife!”"
13965,“There!”
13966,"Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to"
13967,"see Ron running around the cellar, looking up at the low ceiling,"
13968,"searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, said"
13969, 465  
13970,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
13971,"“Thanks” to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank"
13972,"onto the cellar floor, looking groggy and disoriented, many welts"
13973,across his swarthy face.
13974,Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand.
13975,"“There’s no way out, Ron,” said Luna, watching his fruitless ef-"
13976,"forts. “The cellar is completely escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ol-"
13977,"livander has been here for a long time, he’s tried everything.”"
13978,Hermione was screaming again: The sound went through Harry
13979,like physical pain. Barely conscious of the fierce prickling of his
13980,"scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the walls for he"
13981,"hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless."
13982,"“What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!”"
13983,"Hermione’s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half"
13984,"sobbing as he pounded the walls with his fists, and Harry in utter"
13985,desperation seized Hagrid’s pouch from around his neck and groped
13986,"inside it: He pulled out Dumbledore’s Snitch and shook it, hoping"
13987,for he did not know what — nothing happened — he waved the
13988,"broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless — the"
13989,"mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of"
13990,brightest blue —
13991,Dumbledore’s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror.
13992,“Help us!” he yelled at it in mad desperation. “We’re in the cellar
13993,"of Malfoy Manor, help us!”"
13994,The eye blinked and was gone.
13995,Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the
13996,"shard of mirror this way and that, and saw nothing reflected there"
13997,"but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs Hermione was"
13998,"screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing,"
13999,“HERMIONE! HERMIONE!”

14002,“How did you get into my vault?” they heard Bellatrix scream.
14003,“Did that dirty little goblin in the cellar help you?”
14004,“We only met him tonight!” Hermione sobbed. “We’ve never
14005,"been inside your vault. . . . It isn’t the real sword! It’s a copy, just a"
14006,copy!
14007,"“A copy?” screeched Bellatrix. “Oh, a likely story!”"
14008,"“But we can find out easily!” came Lucius’s voice. “Draco, fetch"
14009,"the goblin, he can tell us whether the sword is real or not!”"
14010,Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled
14011,on the floor.
14012,"“Griphook,” he whispered into the goblin’s pointed ear, “you must"
14013,"tell them that sword’s a fake, they mustn’t know it’s the real one,"
14014,"Griphook, please —”"
14015,He could hear someone scuttling down the cellar steps; next mo-
14016,"ment, Draco’s shaking voice spoke from behind the door."
14017,"“Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don’t try anything,"
14018,or I’ll kill you!”
14019,"They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the"
14020,"Deluminator and the lights whisked back into his pocket, restoring"
14021,"the cellar’s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched inside,"
14022,"wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the"
14023,"little goblin by the arm and backed out again, dragging Griphook"
14024,with him. The door slammed shut and at the same moment a loud
14025,crack echoed inside the cellar.
14026,Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into
14027,"the air from his pocket, revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had"
14028,just Apparated into their midst.
14029,“DOB — !”
14030,"Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked"
14031,  467   
14032,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14033,terrified at his mistake. Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead: Draco
14034,marching Griphook to Bellatrix.
14035,"Dobby’s enormous, tennis-ball-shaped eyes were wide; he was"
14036,trembling from his feet to the tips of his ears. He was back in the
14037,"home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified."
14038,"“Harry Potter,” he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice,"
14039,“Dobby has come to rescue you.”
14040,“But how did you — ?”
14041,An awful scream drowned Harry’s words: Hermione was being
14042,tortured again. He cut to the essentials.
14043,"“You can Disapparate out of this cellar?” he asked Dobby, who"
14044,"nodded, his ears flapping."
14045,“And you can take humans with you?”
14046,Dobby nodded again.
14047,"“Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Olli-"
14048,"vander, and take them — take them to —”"
14049,"“Bill and Fleur’s,” said Ron. “Shell Cottage on the outskirts of"
14050,Tinworth!”
14051,The elf nodded for a third time.
14052,"“And then come back,” said Harry. “Can you do that, Dobby?”"
14053,"“Of course, Harry Potter,” whispered the little elf. He hurried"
14054,"over to Mr. Ollivander, who appeared to be barely conscious. He"
14055,"took one of the wandmaker’s hands in his own, then held out the"
14056,"other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved."
14057,"“Harry, we want to help you!” Luna whispered."
14058,"“We can’t leave you here,” said Dean."
14059,"“Go, both of you! We’ll see you at Bill and Fleur’s.”"
14060,"As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few"
14061, 468   
14062,MALFOY MANOR
14063,"seconds he looked down, not upon the wandmaker, but on another"
14064,"man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully."
14065,"“Kill me, then, Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will"
14066,not bring you what you seek. . . . There is so much you do not under-
14067,stand. . . .”
14068,"He felt Voldemort’s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut"
14069,"it out, returning to the cellar and the horror of his own present."
14070,"“Go!” Harry beseeched Luna and Dean. “Go! We’ll follow, just"
14071,go!”
14072,They caught hold of the elf ’s outstretched fingers. There was
14073,"another loud crack, and Dobby, Luna, Dean, and Ollivander"
14074,vanished.
14075,“What was that?” shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads.
14076,“Did you hear that? What was that noise in the cellar?”
14077,Harry and Ron stared at each other.
14078,"“Draco — no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!”"
14079,"Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence."
14080,Harry knew that the people in the drawing room were listening for
14081,more noises from the cellar.
14082,"“We’re going to have to try and tackle him,” he whispered to Ron."
14083,They had no choice: The moment anyone entered the room and saw
14084,"the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. “Leave the lights on,”"
14085,"Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps out-"
14086,"side the door, they backed against the wall on either side of it."
14087,"“Stand back,” came Wormtail’s voice. “Stand away from the door."
14088,I am coming in.”
14089,The door flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the
14090,"apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light from the three miniature"
14091, 469  
14092,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14093,suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves
14094,upon him. Ron seized Wormtail’s wand arm and forced it upward;
14095,"Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, muffling his voice. Silently they"
14096,struggled: Wormtail’s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed
14097,around Harry’s throat.
14098,"“What is it, Wormtail?” called Lucius Malfoy from above."
14099,"“Nothing!” Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail’s"
14100,wheezy voice. “All fine!”
14101,Harry could barely breathe.
14102,"“You’re going to kill me?” Harry choked, attempting to prise off the"
14103,"metal fingers. “After I saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!”"
14104,The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it: He
14105,"wrenched himself free, astonished, keeping his hand over Worm-"
14106,tail’s mouth. He saw the ratlike man’s small watery eyes widen with
14107,fear and surprise: He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his
14108,"hand had done, at the tiny, merciful impulse it had betrayed, and"
14109,"he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo that"
14110,moment of weakness.
14111,"“And we’ll have that,” whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail’s wand"
14112,from his other hand.
14113,"Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew’s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes"
14114,had slid from Harry’s face to something else. His own silver fingers
14115,were moving inexorably toward his own throat.
14116,“No —”
14117,"Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but"
14118,there was no stopping it. The silver tool that Voldemort had given
14119,his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and use-
14120,"less owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his"
14121,moment of pity; he was being strangled before their eyes.
14122, 470   
14123,MALFOY MANOR
14124,“No!”
14125,"Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried"
14126,"to pull the crushing metal fingers from around Wormtail’s throat,"
14127,but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue.
14128,"“Relashio!” said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but"
14129,"nothing happened; Pettigrew dropped to his knees, and at the same"
14130,"moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. Worm-"
14131,"tail’s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch,"
14132,and was still.
14133,"Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail’s body"
14134,"on the floor behind them, ran up the stairs and back into the shad-"
14135,owy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they crept
14136,"along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar."
14137,"Now they had a clear view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook,"
14138,who was holding Gryffindor’s sword in his long-fingered hands. Her-
14139,mione was lying at Bellatrix’s feet. She was barely stirring.
14140,“Well?” Bellatrix said to Griphook. “Is it the true sword?”
14141,"Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling"
14142,of his scar.
14143,"“No,” said Griphook. “It is a fake.”"
14144,“Are you sure?” panted Bellatrix. “Quite sure?”
14145,"“Yes,” said the goblin."
14146,"Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it."
14147,"“Good,” she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed"
14148,"another deep cut into the goblin’s face, and he dropped with a yell"
14149,"at her feet. She kicked him aside. “And now,” she said in a voice that"
14150,"burst with triumph, “we call the Dark Lord!”"
14151,And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to
14152,the Dark Mark.
14153, 471    
14154,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14155,"At once, Harry’s scar felt as though it had split open again. His"
14156,"true surroundings vanished: He was Voldemort, and the skeletal"
14157,wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was enraged
14158,"at the summons he felt — he had warned them, he had told them"
14159,to summon him for nothing less than Potter. If they were mis-
14160,taken . . .
14161,"“Kill me, then!” demanded the old man. “You will not win, you"
14162,"cannot win! That wand will never, ever be yours —”"
14163,And Voldemort’s fury broke: A burst of green light filled the
14164,prison room and the frail old body was lifted from its hard bed and
14165,"then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his"
14166,wrath barely controllable. . . . They would suffer his retribution if
14167,they had no good reason for calling him back. . . .
14168,"“And I think,” said Bellatrix’s voice, “we can dispose of the Mud-"
14169,"blood. Greyback, take her if you want her.”"
14170,“NOOOOOOOOOOOO!”
14171,"Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around,"
14172,shocked; she turned her wand to face Ron instead —
14173,"“Expelliarmus!” he roared, pointing Wormtail’s wand at Bella-"
14174,"trix, and hers flew into the air and was caught by Harry, who had"
14175,"sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco, and Greyback wheeled"
14176,"about; Harry yelled, “Stupefy!” and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto"
14177,"the hearth. Jets of light flew from Draco’s, Narcissa’s, and Grey-"
14178,"back’s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind a"
14179,sofa to avoid them.
14180,“STOP OR SHE DIES!”
14181,"Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was"
14182,"supporting Hermione, who seemed to be unconscious, and was"
14183,holding her short silver knife to Hermione’s throat.
14184, 472   
14185,MALFOY MANOR
14186,"“Drop your wands,” she whispered. “Drop them, or we’ll see ex-"
14187,actly how filthy her blood is!”
14188,"Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail’s wand. Harry straightened"
14189,"up, still holding Bellatrix’s."
14190,"“I said, drop them!” she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermi-"
14191,one’s throat: Harry saw beads of blood appear there.
14192,"“All right!” he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix’s wand onto the"
14193,floor at his feet. Ron did the same with Wormtail’s. Both raised their
14194,hands to shoulder height.
14195,"“Good!” she leered. “Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is"
14196,"coming, Harry Potter! Your death approaches!”"
14197,"Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he"
14198,"could feel Voldemort flying through the sky from far away, over a"
14199,"dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to Apparate"
14200,"to them, and Harry could see no way out."
14201,"“Now,” said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the"
14202,"wands, “Cissy, I think we ought to tie these little heroes up again,"
14203,while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure the Dark
14204,"Lord will not begrudge you the girl, Greyback, after what you have"
14205,done tonight.”
14206,At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above.
14207,All of them looked upward in time to see the crystal chandelier
14208,"tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to"
14209,"fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw"
14210,herself aside with a scream. The chandelier crashed to the floor in
14211,"an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of Hermione and"
14212,"the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering"
14213,"shards of crystal flew in all directions: Draco doubled over, his hands"
14214,covering his bloody face.
14215, 473   
14216,CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
14217,"As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took his"
14218,chance: He leapt over an armchair and wrested the three wands from
14219,"Draco’s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and yelled, “Stupefy!”"
14220,"The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the"
14221,"ceiling, and then smashed to the ground."
14222,"As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bel-"
14223,"latrix sprang to her feet, her hair flying as she brandished the silver"
14224,knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway.
14225,"“Dobby!” she screamed, and even Bellatrix froze. “You! You"
14226,dropped the chandelier — ?”
14227,"The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at"
14228,his old mistress.
14229,"“You must not hurt Harry Potter,” he squeaked."
14230,"“Kill him, Cissy!” shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud"
14231,"crack, and Narcissa’s wand too flew into the air and landed on the"
14232,other side of the room.
14233,“You dirty little monkey!” bawled Bellatrix. “How dare you take
14234,"a witch’s wand, how dare you defy your masters?”"
14235,"“Dobby has no master!” squealed the elf. “Dobby is a free elf, and"
14236,Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!”
14237,Harry’s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that
14238,"they had moments, seconds before Voldemort was with them."
14239,"“Ron, catch — and GO!” he yelled, throwing one of the wands"
14240,to him; then he bent down to tug Griphook out from under the
14241,"chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the"
14242,"sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby’s hand and spun on"
14243,the spot to Disapparate.
14244,As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing
14245,"room: of the pale, frozen figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak"
14246, 474    
14247,MALFOY MANOR
14248,"of red that was Ron’s hair, and a blur of flying silver, as Bellatrix’s"
14249,knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing —
14250,Bill and Fleur’s . . . Shell Cottage . . . Bill and Fleur’s . . .
14251,He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was re-
14252,peat the name of the destination and hope that it would suffice
14253,"to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the"
14254,weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of
14255,Gryffindor’s sword bumping against his back; Dobby’s hand jerked
14256,"in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take charge, to"
14257,"pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers,"
14258,to indicate that that was fine with him. . . .
14259,And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell
14260,"to his knees, relinquished Dobby’s hand, and attempted to lower"
14261,Griphook gently to the ground.
14262,"“Are you all right?” he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook"
14263,merely whimpered.
14264,Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to
14265,"be a cottage a short way away under the wide starry sky, and he"
14266,thought he saw movement outside it.
14267,"“Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?” he whispered, clutching the two"
14268,"wands he had brought from the Malfoys’, ready to fight if he needed"
14269,to. “Have we come to the right place? Dobby?”
14270,He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him.
14271,“DOBBY!”
14272,"The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes."
14273,"Together, he and Harry looked down at the silver hilt of the knife"
14274,protruding from the elf ’s heaving chest.
14275,"“Dobby — no — HELP!” Harry bellowed toward the cottage,"
14276,toward the people moving there. “HELP!”

14279,"He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles,"
14280,friends or foes; all he cared about was that a dark stain was spreading
14281,"across Dobby’s front, and that he had stretched out his thin arms to"
14282,Harry with a look of supplication. Harry caught him and laid him
14283,sideways on the cool grass.
14284,"“Dobby, no, don’t die, don’t die —”"
14285,"The elf ’s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort"
14286,to form words.
14287,“Harry . . . Potter . . .”
14288,"And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his"
14289,"eyes were nothing more than great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light"
14290,from the stars they could not see.

14292,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14293,THE WANDMAKER
14294,I     t was like sinking into an old nightmare; for an instant Harry
14295,knelt again beside Dumbledore’s body at the foot of the tallest
14296,"tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he was staring at a tiny body curled"
14297,"upon the grass, pierced by Bellatrix’s silver knife. Harry’s voice was"
14298,"still saying, “Dobby . . . Dobby . . .” even though he knew that the"
14299,elf had gone where he could not call him back.
14300,"After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to"
14301,"the right place, for here were Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gath-"
14302,ering around him as he knelt over the elf.
14303,“Hermione?” he said suddenly. “Where is she?”
14304,"“Ron’s taken her inside,” said Bill. “She’ll be all right.”"
14305,Harry looked back down at Dobby. He stretched out a hand and
14306,"pulled the sharp blade from the elf ’s body, then dragged off his own"
14307,jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket.
14308,The sea was rushing against rock somewhere nearby; Harry lis-
14309,"tened to it while the others talked, discussing matters in which he"
14310, 477    
14311,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14312,"could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the injured"
14313,"Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was"
14314,making suggestions about burying the elf. Harry agreed without
14315,"really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he gazed down at"
14316,"the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of"
14317,"his mind, viewed as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw"
14318,Voldemort punishing those they had left behind at Malfoy Manor.
14319,His rage was dreadful and yet Harry’s grief for Dobby seemed to
14320,"diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry"
14321,"from across a vast, silent ocean."
14322,"“I want to do it properly,” were the first words of which Harry"
14323,was fully conscious of speaking. “Not by magic. Have you got a
14324,spade?”
14325,"And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging the"
14326,"grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden,"
14327,"between bushes. He dug with a kind of fury, relishing the manual"
14328,"work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of his sweat"
14329,and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives.
14330,"His scar burned, but he was master of the pain; he felt it, yet was"
14331,"apart from it. He had learned control at last, learned to shut his"
14332,"mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him"
14333,to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to pos-
14334,"sess Harry while Harry was consumed with grief for Sirius, so his"
14335,"thoughts could not penetrate Harry now, while he mourned Dobby."
14336,"Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out . . . though Dumbledore, of"
14337,"course, would have said that it was love. . . ."
14338,"On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth,"
14339,"subsuming his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the"

14344,"the Malfoys’ returned to him, the things he had heard came back"
14345,"to him, and understanding blossomed in the darkness. . . ."
14346,The steady rhythm of his arms beat time with his thoughts. Hal-
14347,lows . . . Horcruxes . . . Hallows . . . Horcruxes . . . Yet he no longer
14348,"burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had snuffed"
14349,it out: He felt as though he had been slapped awake again.
14350,"Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where"
14351,"Voldemort had been tonight, and whom he had killed in the top-"
14352,"most cell of Nurmengard, and why. . . ."
14353,"And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small uncon-"
14354,scious impulse of mercy. . . . Dumbledore had foreseen that. . . .
14355,How much more had he known?
14356,Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had
14357,lightened a few degrees when he was rejoined by Ron and Dean.
14358,“How’s Hermione?”
14359,"“Better,” said Ron. “Fleur’s looking after her.”"
14360,Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had
14361,"not simply created a perfect grave with his wand, but he did not"
14362,need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with spades
14363,"of their own, and together they worked in silence until the hole"
14364,seemed deep enough.
14365,Harry wrapped the elf more snugly in his jacket. Ron sat on the
14366,"edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he"
14367,"placed upon the elf ’s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which"
14368,"Harry placed carefully upon Dobby’s head, muffling his batlike"
14369,ears.
14370,“We should close his eyes.”
14371,Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness.

14373,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14374,"Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, Fleur a large white apron, from"
14375,the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized
14376,to be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing
14377,"gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; Ron put an arm around her"
14378,"when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur’s"
14379,"coats, crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of"
14380,"the elf ’s eyelids, sliding them over his glassy stare."
14381,"“There,” she said softly. “Now he could be sleeping.”"
14382,"Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that"
14383,"he might have been resting, then climbed out and gazed for the last"
14384,time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break down as he
14385,"remembered Dumbledore’s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden"
14386,"chairs, and the Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation"
14387,"of Dumbledore’s achievements, the stateliness of the white marble"
14388,"tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet"
14389,here the elf lay between bushes in a roughly dug hole.
14390,"“I think we ought to say something,” piped up Luna. “I’ll go"
14391,"first, shall I?”"
14392,"And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the"
14393,bottom of the grave.
14394,"“Thank you so much, Dobby, for rescuing me from that cellar. It’s"
14395,"so unfair that you had to die, when you were so good and brave. I’ll"
14396,always remember what you did for us. I hope you’re happy now.”
14397,"She turned and looked expectantly at Ron, who cleared his throat"
14398,"and said in a thick voice, “Yeah . . . thanks, Dobby.”"
14399,"“Thanks,” muttered Dean."
14400,Harry swallowed.
14401,"“Good-bye, Dobby,” he said. It was all he could manage, but"
14402,"Luna had said it all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of"
14403, 480   
14404,THE WANDMAKER
14405,"earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell neatly upon it, a"
14406,"small, reddish mound."
14407,“D’you mind if I stay here a moment?” he asked the others.
14408,They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon
14409,"his back, and then they all traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving"
14410,Harry alone beside the elf.
14411,"He looked around: There were a number of large white stones,"
14412,"smoothed by the sea, marking the edge of the flower beds. He picked"
14413,"up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place where"
14414,Dobby’s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand.
14415,"There were two in there. He had forgotten, lost track; he could"
14416,not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to remem-
14417,ber wrenching them out of someone’s hand. He selected the shorter
14418,"of the two, which felt friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the"
14419,rock.
14420,"Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared"
14421,upon the rock’s surface. He knew that Hermione could have done
14422,"it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark"
14423,the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up
14424,"again, the stone read:"
14425,"HERE LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF."
14426,"He looked down at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then"
14427,"walked away, his scar still prickling a little, and his mind full of"
14428,"those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken"
14429,"shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible."
14430,They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little
14431,"hall, their attention focused upon Bill, who was talking. The room"
14432,  481   
14433,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14434,"was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood burning"
14435,brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the
14436,"carpet, so he stood in the doorway, listening."
14437,"“. . . lucky that Ginny’s on holiday. If she’d been at Hogwarts,"
14438,they could have taken her before we reached her. Now we know
14439,she’s safe too.”
14440,He looked around and saw Harry standing there.
14441,"“I’ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,” he explained."
14442,“Moved them to Muriel’s. The Death Eaters know Ron’s with you
14443,"now, they’re bound to target the family — don’t apologize,” he"
14444,added at the sight of Harry’s expression. “It was always a matter
14445,"of time, Dad’s been saying so for months. We’re the biggest blood-"
14446,traitor family there is.”
14447,“How are they protected?” asked Harry.
14448,“Fidelius Charm. Dad’s Secret-Keeper. And we’ve done it on this
14449,"cottage too; I’m Secret-Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but"
14450,that’s hardly the most important thing now. Once Ollivander and
14451,"Griphook are well enough, we’ll move them to Muriel’s too. There"
14452,"isn’t much room here, but she’s got plenty. Griphook’s legs are on"
14453,"the mend, Fleur’s given him Skele-Gro; we could probably move"
14454,them in an hour or —”
14455,"“No,” Harry said, and Bill looked startled. “I need both of them"
14456,here. I need to talk to them. It’s important.”
14457,"He heard the authority in his own voice, the conviction, the sense"
14458,of purpose that had come to him as he dug Dobby’s grave. All of
14459,"their faces were turned toward him, looking puzzled."
14460,"“I’m going to wash,” Harry told Bill, looking down at his hands,"
14461,"still covered in mud and Dobby’s blood. “Then I’ll need to see them,"
14462,straightaway.”
14463, 482  
14464,THE WANDMAKER
14465,"He walked into the little kitchen, to the basin beneath a window"
14466,"overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink"
14467,"and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought"
14468,that had come to him in the dark garden. . . .
14469,Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the
14470,"cellar, but Harry knew what he had seen. A piercing blue eye had"
14471,"looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come. Help"
14472,will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
14473,"Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene"
14474,outside the window and to the murmuring of the others in the sit-
14475,"ting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this dawn,"
14476,"than ever before, closer to the heart of it all."
14477,"And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was get-"
14478,ting there too. Harry understood and yet did not understand. His
14479,"instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The"
14480,"Dumbledore in Harry’s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips"
14481,"of his fingers, pressed together as if in prayer."
14482,You gave Ron the Deluminator. You understood him. . . . You gave
14483,him a way back. . . .
14484,And you understood Wormtail too. . . . You knew there was a bit of
14485,"regret there, somewhere. . . ."
14486,"And if you knew them . . . What did you know about me, Dumble-"
14487,dore?
14488,"Am I meant to know, but not to seek? Did you know how hard I’d"
14489,find that? Is that why you made it this difficult? So I’d have time to
14490,work that out?
14491,"Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a"
14492,bright gold rim of dazzling sun was rising over the horizon. Then he
14493,looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily surprised to
14494, 483   
14495,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14496,see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned
14497,"to the hall, and as he did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and there"
14498,"flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a dragonfly over"
14499,"water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well."
14500,Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs.
14501,"“I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,” Harry said."
14502,"“No,” said Fleur. “You will ’ave to wait, ’Arry. Zey are both ill,"
14503,tired —”
14504,"“I’m sorry,” he said without heat, “but it can’t wait. I need to talk"
14505,to them now. Privately — and separately. It’s urgent.”
14506,"“Harry, what the hell’s going on?” asked Bill. “You turn up here"
14507,"with a dead house-elf and a half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks"
14508,"as though she’s been tortured, and Ron’s just refused to tell me"
14509,anything —”
14510,"“We can’t tell you what we’re doing,” said Harry flatly. “You’re in"
14511,"the Order, Bill, you know Dumbledore left us a mission. We’re not"
14512,supposed to talk about it to anyone else.”
14513,"Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was"
14514,staring at Harry. His deeply scarred face was hard to read. Finally
14515,"Bill said, “All right. Who do you want to talk to first?”"
14516,Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was
14517,hardly any time left; now was the moment to decide: Horcruxes or
14518,Hallows?
14519,"“Griphook,” Harry said. “I’ll speak to Griphook first.”"
14520,His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just
14521,cleared an enormous obstacle.
14522,"“Up here, then,” said Bill, leading the way."
14523,Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking
14524,back.
14525, 484    
14526,THE WANDMAKER
14527,"“I need you two as well!” he called to Ron and Hermione, who"
14528,"had been skulking, half concealed, in the doorway of the sitting"
14529,room.
14530,"They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved."
14531,“How are you?” Harry asked Hermione. “You were amazing —
14532,coming up with that story when she was hurting you like that —”
14533,Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed
14534,squeeze.
14535,"“What are we doing now, Harry?” he asked."
14536,“You’ll see. Come on.”
14537,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto"
14538,a small landing. Three doors led off it.
14539,"“In here,” said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur’s room."
14540,"It too had a view of the sea, now flecked with gold in the sunrise."
14541,"Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the spectacular"
14542,"view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took"
14543,the chair beside the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm.
14544,"Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down"
14545,"carefully upon the bed. Griphook grunted thanks, and Bill left,"
14546,closing the door upon them all.
14547,"“I’m sorry to take you out of bed,” said Harry. “How are your"
14548,legs?”
14549,"“Painful,” replied the goblin. “But mending.”"
14550,"He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange"
14551,"look: half truculent, half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin’s sallow"
14552,"skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. Fleur had removed his"
14553,"shoes: His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but"
14554,not by much. His domed head was much bigger than a human’s.
14555,“You probably don’t remember —” Harry began.
14556, 485  
14557,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14558,"“— that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first"
14559,"time you ever visited Gringotts?” said Griphook. “I remember,"
14560,"Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very famous.”"
14561,"Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up."
14562,Harry’s scar was still prickling. He wanted to get through this in-
14563,"terview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time was afraid of"
14564,making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to
14565,"approach his request, the goblin broke the silence."
14566,"“You buried the elf,” he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous."
14567,“I watched you from the window of the bedroom next door.”
14568,"“Yes,” said Harry."
14569,Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black
14570,eyes.
14571,"“You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.”"
14572,"“In what way?” asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently."
14573,“You dug the grave.”
14574,“So?”
14575,Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being
14576,"sneered at for acting like a Muggle, but it did not much matter to"
14577,him whether Griphook approved of Dobby’s grave or not. He gath-
14578,ered himself for the attack.
14579,"“Griphook, I need to ask —”"
14580,“You also rescued a goblin.”
14581,“What?”
14582,“You brought me here. Saved me.”
14583,"“Well, I take it you’re not sorry?” said Harry a little impatiently."
14584,"“No, Harry Potter,” said Griphook, and with one finger he"
14585,"twisted the thin black beard upon his chin, “but you are a very"
14586,odd wizard.”
14587, 486   
14588,THE WANDMAKER
14589,"“Right,” said Harry. “Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you"
14590,can give it to me.”
14591,"The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to"
14592,frown at Harry as though he had never seen anything like him.
14593,“I need to break into a Gringotts vault.”
14594,Harry had not meant to say it so baldly; the words were forced
14595,"from him as pain shot through his lightning scar and he saw, again,"
14596,the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to
14597,deal with Griphook first. Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry
14598,as though he had gone mad.
14599,"“Harry —” said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook."
14600,"“Break into a Gringotts vault?” repeated the goblin, wincing a"
14601,little as he shifted his position upon the bed. “It is impossible.”
14602,"“No, it isn’t,” Ron contradicted him. “It’s been done.”"
14603,"“Yeah,” said Harry. “The same day I first met you, Griphook. My"
14604,"birthday, seven years ago.”"
14605,"“The vault in question was empty at the time,” snapped the gob-"
14606,"lin, and Harry understood that even though Griphook had left"
14607,"Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being breached."
14608,“Its protection was minimal.”
14609,"“Well, the vault we need to get into isn’t empty, and I’m guess-"
14610,"ing its protection will be pretty powerful,” said Harry. “It belongs"
14611,to the Lestranges.”
14612,"He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but"
14613,there would be time enough to explain after Griphook had given
14614,his answer.
14615,"“You have no chance,” said Griphook flatly. “No chance at all. If"
14616,"you seek beneath our floors, a treasure that was never yours —”"
14617,"“Thief, you have been warned, beware — yeah, I know, I remember,”"
14618, 487   
14619,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14620,"said Harry. “But I’m not trying to get myself any treasure, I’m not"
14621,trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you believe that?”
14622,"The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on"
14623,"Harry’s forehead prickled, but he ignored it, refusing to acknowl-"
14624,edge its pain or its invitation.
14625,“If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not
14626,"seek personal gain,” said Griphook finally, “it would be you, Harry"
14627,Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection or the re-
14628,spect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.”
14629,"“Wand-carriers,” repeated Harry: The phrase fell oddly upon his"
14630,"ears as his scar prickled, as Voldemort turned his thoughts north-"
14631,"ward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door."
14632,"“The right to carry a wand,” said the goblin quietly, “has long"
14633,been contested between wizards and goblins.”
14634,"“Well, goblins can do magic without wands,” said Ron."
14635,“That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-
14636,"lore with other magical beings, they deny us the possibility of ex-"
14637,tending our powers!”
14638,"“Well, goblins won’t share any of their magic either,” said Ron."
14639,“You won’t tell us how to make swords and armor the way you
14640,do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have
14641,never —”
14642,"“It doesn’t matter,” said Harry, noting Griphook’s rising color."
14643,“This isn’t about wizards versus goblins or any other sort of magi-
14644,cal creature —”
14645,Griphook gave a nasty laugh.
14646,"“But it is, it is about precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes"
14647,"ever more powerful, your race is set still more firmly above mine!"

14650,"Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered,"
14651,and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?”
14652,"“We do!” said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright."
14653,"“We protest! And I’m hunted quite as much as any goblin or elf,"
14654,Griphook! I’m a Mudblood!”
14655,“Don’t call yourself —” Ron muttered.
14656,"“Why shouldn’t I?” said Hermione. “Mudblood, and proud of"
14657,"it! I’ve got no higher position under this new order than you have,"
14658,"Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the Malfoys’!”"
14659,"As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to"
14660,"reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had made, scarlet against her throat."
14661,“Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?” she asked.
14662,“Did you know that we’ve wanted elves to be freed for years?” (Ron
14663,fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione’s chair.) “You can’t
14664,"want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!”"
14665,The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiosity he had
14666,shown Harry.
14667,“What do you seek within the Lestranges’ vault?” he asked
14668,abruptly. “The sword that lies inside it is a fake. This is the real
14669,one.” He looked from one to the other of them. “I think that you
14670,already know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.”
14671,"“But the fake sword isn’t the only thing in that vault, is it?” asked"
14672,Harry. “Perhaps you’ve seen the other things in there?”
14673,His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his ef-
14674,forts to ignore the pulsing of his scar.
14675,The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again.
14676,“It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We
14677,are the guardians of fabulous treasures. We have a duty to the
14678, 489   
14679,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14680,"objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our"
14681,fingers.”
14682,"The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from"
14683,Harry to Hermione to Ron and then back again.
14684,"“So young,” he said finally, “to be fighting so many.”"
14685,“Will you help us?” said Harry. “We haven’t got a hope of break-
14686,ing in without a goblin’s help. You’re our one chance.”
14687,"“I shall . . . think about it,” said Griphook maddeningly."
14688,“But —” Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs.
14689,"“Thank you,” said Harry."
14690,"The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement,"
14691,then flexed his short legs.
14692,"“I think,” he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and"
14693,"Fleur’s bed, “that the Skele-Gro has finished its work. I may be able"
14694,to sleep at last. Forgive me. . . .”
14695,"“Yeah, of course,” said Harry, but before leaving the room he"
14696,leaned forward and took the sword of Gryffindor from beside the
14697,"goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw resent-"
14698,ment in the goblin’s eyes as he closed the door upon him.
14699,"“Little git,” whispered Ron. “He’s enjoying keeping us"
14700,hanging.”
14701,"“Harry,” whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from"
14702,"the door, into the middle of the still-dark landing, “are you saying"
14703,what I think you’re saying? Are you saying there’s a Horcrux in the
14704,Lestranges’ vault?”
14705,"“Yes,” said Harry. “Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we’d"
14706,"been in there, she was beside herself. Why? What did she think we’d"
14707,"seen, what else did she think we might have taken? Something she"

14712,"places he’s done something important?” said Ron, looking baffled."
14713,“Was he ever inside the Lestranges’ vault?”
14714,"“I don’t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,” said Harry."
14715,"“He never had gold there when he was younger, because nobody"
14716,"left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the outside,"
14717,"though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.”"
14718,"Harry’s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and"
14719,Hermione to understand about Gringotts before they spoke to
14720,Ollivander.
14721,“I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Grin-
14722,gotts vault. I think he’d have seen it as a real symbol of belonging
14723,"to the Wizarding world. And don’t forget, he trusted Bellatrix and"
14724,"her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and"
14725,they went looking for him after he vanished. He said it the night he
14726,"came back, I heard him.”"
14727,Harry rubbed his scar.
14728,"“I don’t think he’d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though."
14729,He never told Lucius Malfoy the truth about the diary. He prob-
14730,ably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place it
14731,in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to
14732,"hide, Hagrid told me . . . except for Hogwarts.”"
14733,"When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head."
14734,“You really understand him.”
14735,"“Bits of him,” said Harry. “Bits . . . I just wish I’d understood Dum-"
14736,bledore as much. But we’ll see. Come on — Ollivander now.”
14737,Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but impressed as they
14738,followed him across the little landing and knocked upon the door
14739,opposite Bill and Fleur’s. A weak “Come in!” answered them.

14742,The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the
14743,"window. He had been held in the cellar for more than a year, and"
14744,"tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated,"
14745,the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin.
14746,His great silver eyes seemed vast in their sunken sockets. The hands
14747,that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a skeleton. Harry
14748,"sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising"
14749,sun was not visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and
14750,the freshly dug grave.
14751,"“Mr. Ollivander, I’m sorry to disturb you,” Harry said."
14752,“My dear boy.” Ollivander’s voice was feeble. “You rescued us. I
14753,thought we would die in that place. I can never thank you . . . never
14754,thank you . . . enough.”
14755,“We were glad to do it.”
14756,"Harry’s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was"
14757,"hardly any time left in which to beat Voldemort to his goal, or else"
14758,to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic . . . yet he had
14759,made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feign-
14760,"ing a calm he did not feel, he groped in the pouch around his neck"
14761,and took out the two halves of his broken wand.
14762,"“Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.”"
14763,"“Anything. Anything,” said the wandmaker weakly."
14764,“Can you mend this? Is it possible?”
14765,"Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two"
14766,barely connected halves into his palm.
14767,"“Holly and phoenix feather,” said Ollivander in a tremulous"
14768,voice. “Eleven inches. Nice and supple.”
14769,"“Yes,” said Harry. “Can you — ?”"
14770,"“No,” whispered Ollivander. “I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand"

14772,THE WANDMAKER
14773,that has suffered this degree of damage cannot be repaired by any
14774,means that I know of.”
14775,"Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless."
14776,He took the wand halves back and replaced them in the pouch
14777,around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shat-
14778,"tered wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had"
14779,taken from his pocket the two wands he had brought from the
14780,Malfoys’.
14781,“Can you identify these?” Harry asked.
14782,The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to
14783,"his faded eyes, rolling it between his knobble-knuckled fingers, flex-"
14784,ing it slightly.
14785,"“Walnut and dragon heartstring,” he said. “Twelve-and-three-"
14786,quarter inches. Unyielding. This wand belonged to Bellatrix
14787,Lestrange.”
14788,“And this one?”
14789,Ollivander performed the same examination.
14790,“Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably
14791,springy. This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.”
14792,“Was?” repeated Harry. “Isn’t it still his?”
14793,“Perhaps not. If you took it —”
14794,“— I did —”
14795,"“— then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking mat-"
14796,"ters. Much also depends upon the wand itself. In general, however,"
14797,"where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.”"
14798,"There was silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of"
14799,the sea.
14800,"“You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings,” said Harry, “like"
14801,they can think for themselves.”
14802, 493   
14803,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14804,"“The wand chooses the wizard,” said Ollivander. “That much has"
14805,always been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore.”
14806,"“A person can still use a wand that hasn’t chosen them, though?”"
14807,asked Harry.
14808,"“Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel"
14809,"your magic through almost any instrument. The best results, how-"
14810,"ever, must always come where there is the strongest affinity between"
14811,wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attrac-
14812,"tion, and then a mutual quest for experience, the wand learning"
14813,"from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.”"
14814,The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful
14815,sound.
14816,"“I took this wand from Draco Malfoy by force,” said Harry. “Can"
14817,I use it safely?”
14818,"“I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the con-"
14819,quered wand will usually bend its will to its new master.”
14820,"“So I should use this one?” said Ron, pulling Wormtail’s wand"
14821,out of his pocket and handing it to Ollivander.
14822,“Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches.
14823,"Brittle. I was forced to make this shortly after my kidnapping, for"
14824,"Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your bid-"
14825,"ding, and do it well, than another wand.”"
14826,"“And this holds true for all wands, does it?” asked Harry."
14827,"“I think so,” replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Har-"
14828,"ry’s face. “You ask deep questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex"
14829,and mysterious branch of magic.”
14830,"“So, it isn’t necessary to kill the previous owner to take true pos-"
14831,session of a wand?” asked Harry.
14832,Ollivander swallowed.
14833,  494   
14834,THE WANDMAKER
14835,"“Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.”"
14836,"“There are legends, though,” said Harry, and as his heart rate"
14837,"quickened, the pain in his scar became more intense; he was sure"
14838,that Voldemort had decided to put his idea into action. “Legends
14839,about a wand — or wands — that have passed from hand to hand
14840,by murder.”
14841,Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light
14842,"gray, and his eyes were enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what"
14843,looked like fear.
14844,"“Only one wand, I think,” he whispered."
14845,"“And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn’t he?” asked Harry."
14846,"“I — how?” croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at"
14847,Ron and Hermione for help. “How do you know this?”
14848,“He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection
14849,"between our wands,” said Harry."
14850,Ollivander looked terrified.
14851,"“He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse,"
14852,"I — I had no choice but to tell him what I knew, what I guessed!”"
14853,"“I understand,” said Harry. “You told him about the twin cores?"
14854,You said he just had to borrow another wizard’s wand?”
14855,"Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry"
14856,knew. He nodded slowly.
14857,"“But it didn’t work,” Harry went on. “Mine still beat the bor-"
14858,rowed wand. Do you know why that is?”
14859,Ollivander shook his head as slowly as he had just nodded.
14860,“I had . . . never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed
14861,something unique that night. The connection of the twin cores is
14862,"incredibly rare, yet why your wand should have snapped the bor-"

14866,"“We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes"
14867,hands by murder. When You-Know-Who realized my wand had
14868,"done something strange, he came back and asked about that other"
14869,"wand, didn’t he?”"
14870,“How do you know this?”
14871,Harry did not answer.
14872,"“Yes, he asked,” whispered Ollivander. “He wanted to know ev-"
14873,erything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the
14874,"Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.”"
14875,Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted.
14876,"“The Dark Lord,” said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones,"
14877,“had always been happy with the wand I made him — yew and
14878,"phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches — until he discovered"
14879,"the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more pow-"
14880,"erful wand, as the only way to conquer yours.”"
14881,"“But he’ll know soon, if he doesn’t already, that mine’s broken"
14882,"beyond repair,” said Harry quietly."
14883,"“No!” said Hermione, sounding frightened. “He can’t know that,"
14884,"Harry, how could he — ?”"
14885,"“Priori Incantatem,” said Harry. “We left your wand and the"
14886,"blackthorn wand at the Malfoys’, Hermione. If they examine them"
14887,"properly, make them re-create the spells they’ve cast lately, they’ll"
14888,"see that yours broke mine, they’ll see that you tried and failed to"
14889,"mend it, and they’ll realize that I’ve been using the blackthorn one"
14890,ever since.”
14891,The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained
14892,"from her face. Ron gave Harry a reproachful look, and said, “Let’s"
14893,not worry about that now —”
14894,But Mr. Ollivander intervened.
14895, 496   
14896,THE WANDMAKER
14897,“The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your
14898,"destruction, Mr. Potter. He is determined to possess it because he"
14899,believes it will make him truly invulnerable.”
14900,“And will it?”
14901,"“The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,” said"
14902,"Ollivander, “but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the"
14903,"Deathstick is, I must admit . . . formidable.”"
14904,"Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when"
14905,"they first met, of how much he liked Ollivander. Even now, having"
14906,"been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the Dark"
14907,wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much
14908,as it repulsed him.
14909,"“You — you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?”"
14910,asked Hermione.
14911,"“Oh yes,” said Ollivander. “Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the"
14912,"wand’s course through history. There are gaps, of course, and long"
14913,"ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or hidden; but"
14914,always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that
14915,those who are learned in wandlore recognize. There are written ac-
14916,"counts, some of them obscure, that I and other wandmakers have"
14917,made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.”
14918,“So you — you don’t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?” Her-
14919,mione asked hopefully.
14920,"“No,” said Ollivander. “Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do"
14921,"not know. Its history is bloody, but that may be simply due to the"
14922,"fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such passions in"
14923,"wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and"
14924,an object of incredible fascination to all of us who study the power
14925,of wands.”

14928,"“Mr. Ollivander,” said Harry, “you told You-Know-Who that"
14929,"Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”"
14930,"Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as"
14931,he gulped.
14932,“But how — how do you — ?”
14933,"“Never mind how I know it,” said Harry, closing his eyes mo-"
14934,"mentarily as his scar burned and he saw, for mere seconds, a vision"
14935,"of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so much"
14936,farther north. “You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had
14937,the wand?”
14938,"“It was a rumor,” whispered Ollivander. “A rumor, years and"
14939,"years ago, long before you were born! I believe Gregorovitch himself"
14940,started it. You can see how good it would be for business: that he
14941,was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!”
14942,"“Yes, I can see that,” said Harry. He stood up. “Mr. Ollivander,"
14943,"one last thing, and then we’ll let you get some rest. What do you"
14944,know about the Deathly Hallows?”
14945,"“The — the what?” asked the wandmaker, looking utterly"
14946,bewildered.
14947,“The Deathly Hallows.”
14948,“I’m afraid I don’t know what you’re talking about. Is this still
14949,something to do with wands?”
14950,Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander
14951,was not acting. He did not know about the Hallows.
14952,"“Thank you,” said Harry. “Thank you very much. We’ll leave"
14953,you to get some rest now.”
14954,Ollivander looked stricken.
14955,“He was torturing me!” he gasped. “The Cruciatus Curse . . . you
14956,have no idea. . . .”
14957, 498  
14958,THE WANDMAKER
14959,"“I do,” said Harry. “I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you"
14960,for telling me all of this.”
14961,He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught a
14962,"glimpse of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean sitting at the table in the"
14963,"kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as"
14964,"he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and con-"
14965,"tinued into the garden, Ron and Hermione behind him. The reddish"
14966,"mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry walked"
14967,"back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully."
14968,It was a huge effort now to close down the visions that were forc-
14969,"ing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have to resist"
14970,"only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to"
14971,know that his theory was right. He must make only one more short
14972,"effort, so that he could explain to Ron and Hermione."
14973,"“Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,” he said."
14974,“I saw You-Know-Who trying to find him. When he tracked him
14975,"down, he found that Gregorovitch didn’t have it anymore: It was"
14976,stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that
14977,"Gregorovitch had it, I don’t know — but if Gregorovitch was stupid"
14978,"enough to spread the rumor, it can’t have been that difficult.”"
14979,Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts; Harry could see him
14980,"standing there, and see too the lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, com-"
14981,ing closer and closer.
14982,“And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful.
14983,"And at the height of his power, when Dumbledore knew he was"
14984,"the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat"
14985,"him, and he took the Elder Wand.”"
14986,“Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?” said Ron. “But then — where
14987,is it now?”

14989,CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR
14990,"“At Hogwarts,” said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the"
14991,cliff-top garden.
14992,"“But then, let’s go!” said Ron urgently. “Harry, let’s go and get it"
14993,before he does!”
14994,"“It’s too late for that,” said Harry. He could not help himself,"
14995,"but clutched his head, trying to help it resist. “He knows where it"
14996,is. He’s there now.”
14997,“Harry!” Ron said furiously. “How long have you known this —
14998,why have we been wasting time? Why did you talk to Griphook
14999,first? We could have gone — we could still go —”
15000,"“No,” said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. “Hermi-"
15001,one’s right. Dumbledore didn’t want me to have it. He didn’t want
15002,me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.”
15003,"“The unbeatable wand, Harry!” moaned Ron."
15004,“I’m not supposed to . . . I’m supposed to get the Horcruxes. . . .”
15005,And now everything was cool and dark: The sun was barely vis-
15006,"ible over the horizon as he glided alongside Snape, up through the"
15007,grounds toward the lake.
15008,"“I shall join you in the castle shortly,” he said in his high, cold"
15009,voice. “Leave me now.”
15010,"Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billow-"
15011,"ing behind him. Harry walked slowly, waiting for Snape’s figure to"
15012,"disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, to see"
15013,"where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows,"
15014,and he could conceal himself . . . and in a second he had cast upon
15015,himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even from his own
15016,eyes.
15017,"And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the out-"

15021,"And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The"
15022,"white marble tomb, an unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape."
15023,"He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that heady sense of"
15024,purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand: How fitting
15025,that this would be its last great act.
15026,The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was
15027,as long and thin as it had been in life. He raised the wand again.
15028,"The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent, pale, sunken,"
15029,yet almost perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the
15030,crooked nose: He felt amused derision. Dumbledore’s hands were
15031,"folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, bur-"
15032,ied with him.
15033,Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect
15034,the wand? Had he thought that the Dark Lord would be scared to
15035,violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the wand
15036,"from Dumbledore’s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew"
15037,"from its tip, sparkling over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve"

15041,SHELL COTTAGE
15042,B     ill and Fleur’s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the
15043,"sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was"
15044,a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny
15045,"cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the"
15046,"sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent"
15047,much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded
15048,"cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea,"
15049,"and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face."
15050,The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand
15051,"still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing"
15052,"not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help"
15053,voicing whenever they were together.
15054,“What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time
15055,to get the wand?” “What if working out what the symbol meant made
15056,"you ‘worthy’ to get the Hallows?” “Harry, if that really is the Elder"
15057,"Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?”"
15058,  502  
15059,SHELL COTTAGE
15060,Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered
15061,whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Volde-
15062,mort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfacto-
15063,rily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct
15064,"the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded"
15065,feebler to him.
15066,The odd thing was that Hermione’s support made him feel just
15067,as confused as Ron’s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder
15068,"Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that"
15069,"the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to"
15070,be considered.
15071,"“You could never have done that, Harry,” she said again and"
15072,again. “You couldn’t have broken into Dumbledore’s grave.”
15073,But the idea of Dumbledore’s corpse frightened Harry much less
15074,than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living
15075,Dumbledore’s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the
15076,"dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering"
15077,"whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken"
15078,"the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over"
15079,"him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the"
15080,"cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained"
15081,before he died.
15082,"“But is he dead?” said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the"
15083,cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the
15084,cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found
15085,"him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their"
15086,argument.
15087,"“Yes, he is, Ron, please don’t start that again!”"
15088,"“Look at the facts, Hermione,” said Ron, speaking across Harry,"

15091,who continued to gaze at the horizon. “The silver doe. The sword.
15092,The eye Harry saw in the mirror —”
15093,"“Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don’t you,"
15094,Harry?”
15095,"“I could have,” said Harry without looking at her."
15096,"“But you don’t think you did, do you?” asked Ron."
15097,"“No, I don’t,” said Harry."
15098,"“There you go!” said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry"
15099,"on. “If it wasn’t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in"
15100,"the cellar, Hermione?”"
15101,“I can’t — but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us
15102,if he’s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?”
15103,"“I dunno, it could’ve been his ghost!”"
15104,"“Dumbledore wouldn’t come back as a ghost,” said Harry. There"
15105,"was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that"
15106,much. “He would have gone on.”
15107,"“What d’you mean, ‘gone on’?” asked Ron, but before Harry"
15108,"could say any more, a voice behind them said, “ ’Arry?”"
15109,"Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in"
15110,the breeze.
15111,"“ ’Arry, Grip’ook would like to speak to you. ’E eez in ze smallest"
15112,"bedroom, ’e says ’e does not want to be over’eard.”"
15113,Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was
15114,clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house.
15115,"Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest"
15116,"of the cottage’s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept"
15117,"by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright,"
15118,"cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest"
15119,"of the airy, light cottage."

15122,"“I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,” said the goblin, who"
15123,"was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his"
15124,spindly fingers. “Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it
15125,"base treachery, I have decided to help you —”"
15126,"“That’s great!” said Harry, relief surging through him. “Griphook,"
15127,"thank you, we’re really —”"
15128,"“— in return,” said the goblin firmly, “for payment.”"
15129,"Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated."
15130,“How much do you want? I’ve got gold.”
15131,"“Not gold,” said Griphook. “I have gold.”"
15132,His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes.
15133,“I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.”
15134,Harry’s spirits plummeted.
15135,"“You can’t have that,” he said. “I’m sorry.”"
15136,"“Then,” said the goblin softly, “we have a problem.”"
15137,"“We can give you something else,” said Ron eagerly. “I’ll bet the"
15138,"Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we"
15139,get into the vault.”
15140,He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily.
15141,"“I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to"
15142,which I have no right!”
15143,“The sword’s ours —”
15144,"“It is not,” said the goblin."
15145,"“We’re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor’s —”"
15146,"“And before it was Gryffindor’s, whose was it?” demanded the"
15147,"goblin, sitting up straight."
15148,"“No one’s,” said Ron. “It was made for him, wasn’t it?”"
15149,"“No!” cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long"
15150,finger at Ron. “Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk
15151, 505    
15152,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15153,"the First’s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a lost treasure,"
15154,a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins! The sword
15155,"is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!”"
15156,"Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then"
15157,"said, “We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that’s all right. Could"
15158,you give us a few minutes?”
15159,"The goblin nodded, looking sour."
15160,"Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fire-"
15161,"place, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron"
15162,"said, “He’s having a laugh. We can’t let him have that sword.”"
15163,“It is true?” Harry asked Hermione. “Was the sword stolen by
15164,Gryffindor?”
15165,"“I don’t know,” she said hopelessly. “Wizarding history often skates"
15166,"over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there’s"
15167,no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.”
15168,"“It’ll be one of those goblin stories,” said Ron, “about how the wiz-"
15169,ards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should
15170,think ourselves lucky he hasn’t asked for one of our wands.”
15171,"“Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron,” said Her-"
15172,mione. “They’ve been treated brutally in the past.”
15173,"“Goblins aren’t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?”"
15174,said Ron. “They’ve killed plenty of us. They’ve fought dirty too.”
15175,“But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most under-
15176,"handed and violent isn’t going to make him more likely to help us,"
15177,is it?”
15178,There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the
15179,problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby’s grave. Luna
15180,was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone.
15181,"“Okay,” said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, “how’s"
15182,  506   
15183,SHELL COTTAGE
15184,this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the
15185,"vault, and then he can have it. There’s a fake in there, isn’t there?"
15186,"We switch them, and give him the fake.”"
15187,"“Ron, he’d know the difference better than we would!” said Her-"
15188,mione. “He’s the only one who realized there had been a swap!”
15189,"“Yeah, but we could scarper before he realizes —”"
15190,He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him.
15191,"“That,” she said quietly, “is despicable. Ask for his help, then"
15192,"double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don’t like wizards,"
15193,Ron?”
15194,Ron’s ears had turned red.
15195,"“All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What’s"
15196,"your solution, then?”"
15197,"“We need to offer him something else, something just as"
15198,valuable.”
15199,“Brilliant. I’ll go and get one of our other ancient goblin-made
15200,swords and you can gift wrap it.”
15201,Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin
15202,"would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something"
15203,"as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable"
15204,weapon against the Horcruxes.
15205,He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush
15206,of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword
15207,was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor;
15208,"Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard"
15209,who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin. . . .
15210,"“Maybe he’s lying,” Harry said, opening his eyes again. “Griphook."
15211,Maybe Gryffindor didn’t take the sword. How do we know the
15212,goblin version of history’s right?”
15213, 507  
15214,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15215,“Does it make a difference?” asked Hermione.
15216,"“Changes how I feel about it,” said Harry."
15217,He took a deep breath.
15218,“We’ll tell him he can have the sword after he’s helped us get
15219,into that vault — but we’ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly
15220,when he can have it.”
15221,"A grin spread slowly across Ron’s face. Hermione, however,"
15222,looked alarmed.
15223,"“Harry, we can’t —”"
15224,"“He can have it,” Harry went on, “after we’ve used it on all of"
15225,the Horcruxes. I’ll make sure he gets it then. I’ll keep my word.”
15226,“But that could be years!” said Hermione.
15227,"“I know that, but he needn’t. I won’t be lying . . . really.”"
15228,Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He
15229,remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to
15230,Nurmengard: For the Greater Good. He pushed the idea away.
15231,What choice did they have?
15232,"“I don’t like it,” said Hermione."
15233,"“Nor do I, much,” Harry admitted."
15234,"“Well, I think it’s genius,” said Ron, standing up again. “Let’s"
15235,go and tell him.”
15236,"Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to"
15237,phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the
15238,sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt
15239,"irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However,"
15240,Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry.
15241,"“I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword"
15242,of Gryffindor if I help you?”
15243,"“Yes,” said Harry."
15244, 508  
15245,SHELL COTTAGE
15246,"“Then shake,” said the goblin, holding out his hand."
15247,Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes
15248,"saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him,"
15249,"clapped his hands together, and said, “So. We begin!”"
15250,It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again.
15251,"They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, ac-"
15252,"cording to Griphook’s preference, in semidarkness."
15253,"“I have visited the Lestranges’ vault only once,” Griphook told"
15254,"them, “on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It"
15255,is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families
15256,"store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest"
15257,and best protected. . . .”
15258,They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time.
15259,Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after prob-
15260,"lem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice"
15261,Potion was greatly depleted.
15262,"“There’s really only enough left for one of us,” said Hermione,"
15263,tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight.
15264,"“That’ll be enough,” said Harry, who was examining Griphook’s"
15265,hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways.
15266,The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice
15267,"that something was going on now that Harry, Ron, and Hermione"
15268,"only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although"
15269,"Harry often felt Bill’s eyes on the three of them at the table, thought-"
15270,"ful, concerned."
15271,"The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he"
15272,did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly blood-
15273,"thirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures, and seemed"
15274,to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards
15275, 509   
15276,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15277,to reach the Lestranges’ vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was
15278,"shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it: They needed"
15279,Griphook.
15280,The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after
15281,"his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his"
15282,"room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry"
15283,outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement
15284,could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the over-
15285,"crowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting,"
15286,"instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi."
15287,"Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that"
15288,the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him;
15289,"his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding,"
15290,"that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work."
15291,"“I’m sorry,” he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped"
15292,her prepare dinner. “I never meant you to have to deal with all of
15293,this.”
15294,"She had just set some knives to work, chopping up steaks for"
15295,"Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since"
15296,he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced away
15297,"behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened."
15298,"“ ’Arry, you saved my sister’s life, I do not forget.”"
15299,"This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against"
15300,reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger.
15301,"“Anyway,” Fleur went on, pointing her wand at a pot of sauce on"
15302,"the stove, which began to bubble at once, “Mr. Ollivander leaves"
15303,"for Muriel’s zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,” she"
15304,"scowled a little at the mention of him, “can move downstairs, and"

15308,"“We don’t mind sleeping in the living room,” said Harry, who"
15309,knew that Griphook would think poorly of having to sleep on the
15310,sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. “Don’t
15311,"worry about us.” And when she tried to protest he went on, “We’ll"
15312,"be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won’t need"
15313,to be here much longer.”
15314,"“But what do you mean?” she said, frowning at him, her wand"
15315,pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. “Of course
15316,"you must not leave, you are safe ’ere!”"
15317,"She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was"
15318,glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean
15319,"entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full"
15320,of driftwood.
15321,"“. . . and tiny little ears,” Luna was saying, “a bit like a hippo’s,"
15322,"Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them,"
15323,"you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast. . . .”"
15324,"Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed,"
15325,following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where
15326,Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance
15327,"to escape Fleur’s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin"
15328,juice and followed them.
15329,“. . . and if you ever come to our house I’ll be able to show you
15330,"the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven’t seen it yet, be-"
15331,cause the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I
15332,"never got home for Christmas,” Luna was saying, as she and Dean"
15333,relaid the fire.
15334,"“Luna, we told you,” Hermione called over to her. “That horn"
15335,"exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned"
15336,Snorkack —”

15339,"“No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,” said Luna serenely."
15340,"“Daddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend"
15341,"themselves, you know.”"
15342,Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as
15343,"Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wand-"
15344,"maker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill’s arm as"
15345,"the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase."
15346,"“I’m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,” said Luna, approaching"
15347,the old man.
15348,"“And I you, my dear,” said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder."
15349,“You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.”
15350,"“So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,” said Fleur, kissing him on both"
15351,cheeks. “And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering
15352,a package to Bill’s Auntie Muriel? I never returned ’er tiara.”
15353,"“It will be an honor,” said Ollivander with a little bow, “the very"
15354,least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.”
15355,"Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the"
15356,wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from
15357,the low-hanging lamp.
15358,"“Moonstones and diamonds,” said Griphook, who had sidled into"
15359,"the room without Harry noticing. “Made by goblins, I think?”"
15360,"“And paid for by wizards,” said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot"
15361,him a look that was both furtive and challenging.
15362,A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and
15363,Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in
15364,around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to
15365,"move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate"
15366,"beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her"
15367,"food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill"

15370,"returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair"
15371,tangled by the wind.
15372,"“Everything’s fine,” he told Fleur. “Ollivander settled in, Mum"
15373,and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love. Fred and George
15374,"are driving Muriel up the wall, they’re still operating an Owl-Order"
15375,business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara
15376,"back, though. She said she thought we’d stolen it.”"
15377,"“Ah, she eez charmante, your aunt,” said Fleur crossly, waving"
15378,her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in
15379,midair. She caught them and marched out of the room.
15380,"“Daddy’s made a tiara,” piped up Luna. “Well, more of a crown,"
15381,really.”
15382,Ron caught Harry’s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was
15383,remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit
15384,to Xenophilius.
15385,"“Yes, he’s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He"
15386,thinks he’s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the
15387,billywig wings really made a difference —”
15388,There was a bang on the front door. Everyone’s head turned to-

15390,"Bill jumped to his feet, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron,"
15391,and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the
15392,"table, out of sight."
15393,“Who is it?” Bill called.
15394,"“It is I, Remus John Lupin!” called a voice over the howling"
15395,wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? “I am
15396,"a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-"
15397,"Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in"

15401,"“Lupin,” muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it"
15402,open.
15403,"Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a"
15404,"traveling cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up,"
15405,"looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried"
15406,"aloud, “It’s a boy! We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father!”"
15407,Hermione shrieked.
15408,“Wha — ? Tonks — Tonks has had the baby?”
15409,"“Yes, yes, she’s had the baby!” shouted Lupin. All around the"
15410,"table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both"
15411,"squealed, “Congratulations!” and Ron said, “Blimey, a baby!” as if"
15412,he had never heard of such a thing before.
15413,"“Yes — yes — a boy,” said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by"
15414,his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry;
15415,the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have
15416,happened.
15417,“You’ll be godfather?” he said as he released Harry.
15418,“M-me?” stammered Harry
15419,"“You, yes, of course — Dora quite agrees, no one better —”"
15420,“I — yeah — blimey —”

15423,for a drink.
15424,"“I can’t stay long, I must get back,” said Lupin, beaming around"
15425,at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him.
15426,"“Thank you, thank you, Bill.”"

15433,“ ’Oo does ’e look like?” Fleur inquired.
15434,"“I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not"
15435,"much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it’s turned"
15436,ginger in the hour since. Probably be blond by the time I get back.
15437,Andromeda says Tonks’s hair started changing color the day that she
15438,"was born.” He drained his goblet. “Oh, go on then, just one more,”"
15439,"he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again."
15440,"The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled,"
15441,and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin’s news
15442,"seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a"
15443,while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating.
15444,Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmo-

15448,"“No . . . no . . . I really must get back,” said Lupin at last, declin-"
15449,ing yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his
15450,traveling cloak back around himself.
15451,"“Good-bye, good-bye — I’ll try and bring some pictures in a few"
15452,days’ time — they’ll all be so glad to know that I’ve seen you —”
15453,"He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women"
15454,"and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into"
15455,the wild night.
15456,"“Godfather, Harry!” said Bill as they walked into the kitchen"
15457,"together, helping clear the table. “A real honor! Congratulations!”"
15458,"As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled"
15459, 515   
15460,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15461,"the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the"
15462,"others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin’s absence."
15463,"“I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn’t been easy to"
15464,get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.”
15465,Bill hesitated.
15466,"“Harry, you’re planning something with Griphook.”"
15467,"It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to"
15468,"deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting."
15469,"“I know goblins,” said Bill. “I’ve worked for Gringotts ever since"
15470,I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards
15471,"and goblins, I have goblin friends — or, at least, goblins I know"
15472,"well, and like.” Again, Bill hesitated."
15473,"“Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you"
15474,promised him in return?”
15475,"“I can’t tell you that,” said Harry. “Sorry, Bill.”"
15476,The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring
15477,through more empty goblets.
15478,"“Wait,” Bill told her. “Just a moment.”"
15479,She backed out and he closed the door again.
15480,"“Then I have to say this,” Bill went on. “If you have struck any"
15481,"kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bar-"
15482,"gain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin"
15483,"notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as"
15484,human ones.”
15485,"Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake"
15486,had stirred inside him.
15487,“What do you mean?” he asked.
15488,"“We are talking about a different breed of being,” said Bill."

15490,SHELL COTTAGE
15491,“Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for cen-
15492,turies — but you’ll know all that from History of Magic. There has
15493,"been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been"
15494,"innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those"
15495,"at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be"
15496,"trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect"
15497,for goblin ownership.”
15498,"“I respect —” Harry began, but Bill shook his head."
15499,"“You don’t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless"
15500,"they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true mas-"
15501,"ter of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin-made"
15502,"objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.”"
15503,“But if it was bought —”
15504,“— then they would consider it rented by the one who had
15505,"paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea"
15506,of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw
15507,Griphook’s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disap-
15508,"proves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it"
15509,ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original pur-
15510,"chaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects,"
15511,"passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little"
15512,more than theft.”
15513,Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill
15514,guessed more than he was letting on.
15515,"“All I am saying,” said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into"
15516,"the sitting room, “is to be very careful what you promise goblins,"
15517,Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to
15518,renege on a promise to a goblin.”
15519,  517   
15520,CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE
15521,"“Right,” said Harry as Bill opened the door, “yeah. Thanks. I’ll"
15522,bear that in mind.”
15523,"As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him,"
15524,born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course
15525,to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black
15526,had been to him.

15530,"T       heir plans were made, their preparations complete; in the"
15531,"smallest bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked"
15532,from the sweater Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor)
15533,lay curled in a small glass phial on the mantelpiece.
15534,"“And you’ll be using her actual wand,” said Harry, nodding to-"
15535,"ward the walnut wand, “so I reckon you’ll be pretty convincing.”"
15536,Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bite
15537,her as she picked it up.
15538,"“I hate this thing,” she said in a low voice. “I really hate it. It feels"
15539,"all wrong, it doesn’t work properly for me. . . . It’s like a bit of her.”"
15540,Harry could not help but remember how Hermione had dis-
15541,"missed his loathing of the blackthorn wand, insisting that he was"
15542,"imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling"
15543,him to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back
15544,"to her, however; the eve of their attempted assault on Gringotts felt"
15545,like the wrong moment to antagonize her.

15548,"“It’ll probably help you get in character, though,” said Ron."
15549,“Think what that wand’s done!”
15550,“But that’s my point!” said Hermione. “This is the wand that
15551,"tortured Neville’s mum and dad, and who knows how many other"
15552,people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!”
15553,Harry had not thought of that: He looked down at the wand and
15554,"was visited by a brutal urge to snap it, to slice it in half with Gryf-"
15555,"findor’s sword, which was propped against the wall beside him."
15556,"“I miss my wand,” Hermione said miserably. “I wish Mr. Olli-"
15557,vander could have made me another one too.”
15558,Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She
15559,"was out on the back lawn at that moment, testing its capabilities in"
15560,"the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the Snatchers,"
15561,was watching rather gloomily.
15562,Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once be-
15563,"longed to Draco Malfoy. He had been surprised, but pleased, to"
15564,discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione’s had
15565,done. Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret
15566,"workings of wands, Harry thought he knew what Hermione’s prob-"
15567,lem was: She had not won the walnut wand’s allegiance by taking
15568,it personally from Bellatrix.
15569,The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry
15570,reached instinctively for the hilt of the sword and drew it close to
15571,"him, but regretted his action at once: He could tell that the gob-"
15572,"lin had noticed. Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said,"
15573,"“We’ve just been checking the last-minute stuff, Griphook. We’ve"
15574,"told Bill and Fleur we’re leaving tomorrow, and we’ve told them not"
15575,to get up to see us off.”
15576,"They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need"
15577, 520   
15578,GRINGOTTS
15579,"to transform into Bellatrix before they left, and the less that Bill and"
15580,"Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to do, the"
15581,better. They had also explained that they would not be returning.
15582,As they had lost Perkins’s old tent on the night that the Snatchers
15583,"caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now packed"
15584,"inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Her-"
15585,mione had protected from the Snatchers by the simple expedient of
15586,stuffing it down her sock.
15587,"Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to men-"
15588,"tion the home comforts they had enjoyed over the last few weeks,"
15589,Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell
15590,Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not
15591,"overheard, tired of being shut in the tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all,"
15592,"he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and when"
15593,they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor’s
15594,sword remained a question to which Harry had no answer. It had
15595,"been impossible to decide how they were going to do it, because the"
15596,"goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more"
15597,"than five minutes at a time: “He could give my mother lessons,”"
15598,"growled Ron, as the goblin’s long fingers kept appearing around the"
15599,"edges of doors. With Bill’s warning in mind, Harry could not help"
15600,suspecting that Griphook was on the watch for possible skulduggery.
15601,Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that
15602,Harry had given up attempting to pick her brains on how best to
15603,"do it; Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been able to snatch"
15604,"a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better"
15605,"than “We’ll just have to wing it, mate.”"
15606,"Harry slept badly that night. Lying awake in the early hours,"
15607,he thought back to the way he had felt the night before they had
15608, 521   
15609,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15610,"infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination,"
15611,"almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety,"
15612,nagging doubts: He could not shake off the fear that it was all going
15613,"to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was good, that"
15614,"Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared"
15615,"for all the difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt"
15616,uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir and was sure that he too
15617,"was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so"
15618,Harry did not speak.
15619,It was a relief when six o’clock arrived and they could slip out of
15620,"their sleeping bags, dress in the semidarkness, then creep out into"
15621,"the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and Griphook. The"
15622,"dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May."
15623,Harry looked up at the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky
15624,and listened to the sea washing backward and forward against the
15625,cliff: He was going to miss the sound.
15626,Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red
15627,earth of Dobby’s grave now; in a year’s time the mound would be
15628,covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf ’s name had al-
15629,ready acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could
15630,"hardly have laid Dobby to rest in a more beautiful place, but Harry"
15631,ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking down
15632,"on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where"
15633,to come to rescue them. His fingers moved absentmindedly to the
15634,"little pouch still strung around his neck, through which he could"
15635,feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had
15636,seen Dumbledore’s eye. Then the sound of a door opening made
15637,him look around.
15638,"Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them,"
15639, 522   
15640,GRINGOTTS
15641,"accompanied by Griphook. As she walked, she was tucking the"
15642,"small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old"
15643,robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew
15644,"perfectly well that it was really Hermione, he could not suppress"
15645,"a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black"
15646,"hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as"
15647,"they rested upon him; but then she spoke, and he heard Hermione"
15648,through Bellatrix’s low voice.
15649,"“She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come"
15650,here so I can do you. . . .”
15651,"“Right, but remember, I don’t like the beard too long —”"
15652,"“Oh, for heaven’s sake, this isn’t about looking handsome —”"
15653,"“It’s not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter,"
15654,try and do it the way you did last time.”
15655,"Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath"
15656,as she transformed various aspects of Ron’s appearance. He was
15657,"to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting to"
15658,the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile
15659,Harry and Griphook were to be concealed under the Invisibility
15660,Cloak.
15661,"“There,” said Hermione, “how does he look, Harry?”"
15662,"It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only,"
15663,"Harry thought, because he knew him so well. Ron’s hair was now"
15664,"long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no freck-"
15665,"les, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows."
15666,"“Well, he’s not my type, but he’ll do,” said Harry. “Shall we go,"
15667,then?”
15668,"All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and"
15669,"silent under the fading stars, then turned and began to walk toward"
15670, 523  
15671,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15672,"the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius Charm"
15673,stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past
15674,"the gate, Griphook spoke."
15675,"“I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?”"
15676,"Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his"
15677,"hands linked in front of Harry’s throat. He was not heavy, but Harry"
15678,disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength with
15679,which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of
15680,the beaded bag and threw it over them both.
15681,"“Perfect,” she said, bending down to check Harry’s feet. “I can’t"
15682,see a thing. Let’s go.”
15683,"Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, con-"
15684,"centrating with all his might on the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that"
15685,was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter
15686,"as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later"
15687,Harry’s feet found pavement and he opened his eyes on Charing
15688,Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions
15689,"of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn’s existence."
15690,"The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the"
15691,"stooped and toothless landlord, was polishing glasses behind the"
15692,bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation
15693,in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the
15694,shadows.
15695,"“Madam Lestrange,” murmured Tom, and as Hermione passed"
15696,he inclined his head subserviently.
15697,"“Good morning,” said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still"
15698,"carrying Griphook piggyback under the Cloak, he saw Tom look"
15699,surprised.
15700,"“Too polite,” Harry whispered in Hermione’s ear as they passed"
15701, 524   
15702,GRINGOTTS
15703,out of the inn into the tiny backyard. “You need to treat people like
15704,they’re scum!”
15705,"“Okay, okay!”"
15706,Hermione drew out Bellatrix’s wand and tapped a brick in the
15707,nondescript wall in front of them. At once the bricks began to whirl
15708,"and spin: A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew wider"
15709,"and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled"
15710,street that was Diagon Alley.
15711,"It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were"
15712,"hardly any shoppers abroad. The crooked, cobbled street was much"
15713,altered now from the bustling place Harry had visited before his
15714,first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever
15715,"were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to"
15716,the Dark Arts had been created since his last visit. Harry’s own face
15717,"glared down at him from posters plastered over many windows, al-"
15718,ways captioned with the words undesirable number one.
15719,A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard
15720,"them moaning to the few passersby, pleading for gold, insisting"
15721,that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody bandage over
15722,his eye.
15723,"As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione."
15724,"They seemed to melt away before her, drawing hoods over their"
15725,faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after them
15726,"curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came stagger-"
15727,ing right across her path.
15728,"“My children!” he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was"
15729,"cracked, high-pitched; he sounded distraught. “Where are my chil-"
15730,"dren? What has he done with them? You know, you know!”"
15731,“I — I really —” stammered Hermione.
15732, 525   
15733,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15734,"The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat: Then, with a bang"
15735,"and a burst of red light he was thrown backward onto the ground,"
15736,"unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched and a look"
15737,of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows
15738,"on either side of the street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking"
15739,passersby gathered their robes about them and broke into gentle
15740,"trots, keen to vacate the scene."
15741,Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more
15742,conspicuous; for a moment Harry wondered whether it might not
15743,be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. Before
15744,"they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry"
15745,from behind them.
15746,"“Why, Madam Lestrange!”"
15747,Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around
15748,"Harry’s neck: A tall, thin wizard with a crown of bushy gray hair"
15749,"and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them."
15750,"“It’s Travers,” hissed the goblin into Harry’s ear, but at that mo-"
15751,ment Harry could not think who Travers was. Hermione had drawn
15752,herself up to her fullest height and said with as much contempt as
15753,she could muster:
15754,“And what do you want?”
15755,"Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted."
15756,"“He’s another Death Eater!” breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled"
15757,sideways to repeat the information into Hermione’s ear.
15758,"“I merely sought to greet you,” said Travers coolly, “but if my"
15759,presence is not welcome . . .”
15760,Harry recognized his voice now; Travers was one of the Death
15761,Eaters who had been summoned to Xenophilius’s house.
15762,  526   
15763,GRINGOTTS
15764,"“No, no, not at all, Travers,” said Hermione quickly, trying to"
15765,cover up her mistake. “How are you?”
15766,"“Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about,"
15767,Bellatrix.”
15768,“Really? Why?” asked Hermione.
15769,"“Well,” Travers coughed, “I heard that the inhabitants of Malfoy"
15770,"Manor were confined to the house, after the . . . ah . . . escape.”"
15771,"Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and"
15772,Bellatrix was not supposed to be out in public —
15773,“The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faith-
15774,"fully in the past,” said Hermione in a magnificent imitation of Bel-"
15775,latrix’s most contemptuous manner. “Perhaps your credit is not as
15776,"good with him as mine is, Travers.”"
15777,"Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less"
15778,suspicious. He glanced down at the man Ron had just Stunned.
15779,“How did it offend you?”
15780,"“It does not matter, it will not do so again,” said Hermione"
15781,coolly.
15782,"“Some of these wandless can be troublesome,” said Travers."
15783,"“While they do nothing but beg I have no objection, but one of them"
15784,actually asked me to plead her case at the Ministry last week. ‘I’m
15785,"a witch, sir, I’m a witch, let me prove it to you!’ ” he said in a squeaky"
15786,impersonation. “As if I was going to give her my wand — but whose
15787,"wand,” said Travers curiously, “are you using at the moment, Bel-"
15788,latrix? I heard that your own was —”
15789,"“I have my wand here,” said Hermione coldly, holding up Bella-"
15790,"trix’s wand. “I don’t know what rumors you have been listening to,"
15791,"Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed.”"
15792,  527  
15793,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15794,"Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead"
15795,to Ron.
15796,“Who is your friend? I do not recognize him.”
15797,"“This is Dragomir Despard,” said Hermione; they had decided"
15798,that a fictional foreigner was the safest cover for Ron to assume.
15799,"“He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark"
15800,Lord’s aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new
15801,regime.”
15802,"“Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?”"
15803,"“ ’Ow you?” said Ron, holding out his hand."
15804,Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron’s hand as though
15805,frightened of dirtying himself.
15806,“So what brings you and your — ah — sympathetic friend to
15807,Diagon Alley this early?” asked Travers.
15808,"“I need to visit Gringotts,” said Hermione."
15809,"“Alas, I also,” said Travers. “Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live"
15810,"without it, yet I confess I deplore the necessity of consorting with"
15811,our long-fingered friends.”
15812,Harry felt Griphook’s clasped hands tighten momentarily around
15813,his neck.
15814,"“Shall we?” said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward."
15815,Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head
15816,"along the crooked, cobbled street toward the place where the snowy-"
15817,white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. Ron
15818,"sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed."
15819,"A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and"
15820,"the worst of it was, with Travers marching at what he believed to"

15825,marble steps leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had
15826,"already warned them, the liveried goblins who usually flanked the"
15827,"entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were"
15828,clutching long thin golden rods.
15829,"“Ah, Probity Probes,” sighed Travers theatrically, “so crude — but"
15830,effective!”
15831,"And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wiz-"
15832,"ards, who raised the golden rods and passed them up and down his"
15833,"body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment and"
15834,hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds; Harry
15835,"pointed Draco’s wand at each of the guards in turn and murmured,"
15836,"“Confundo” twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was looking through"
15837,"the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little"
15838,start as the spells hit them.
15839,Hermione’s long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed
15840,the steps.
15841,"“One moment, madam,” said the guard, raising his Probe."
15842,“But you’ve just done that!” said Hermione in Bellatrix’s com-
15843,"manding, arrogant voice. Travers looked around, eyebrows raised."
15844,The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe
15845,"and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,"
15846,"“Yeah, you’ve just checked them, Marius.”"
15847,"Hermione swept forward, Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook"
15848,trotting invisibly behind them. Harry glanced back as they crossed
15849,the threshold: The wizards were both scratching their heads.
15850,"Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of"
15851,silver and which carried the poem warning of dire retribution to
15852,"potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a knife-"
15853,sharp memory came to him: standing on this very spot on the day
15854, 529  
15855,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15856,"that he had turned eleven, the most wonderful birthday of his life,"
15857,"and Hagrid standing beside him saying, “Like I said, yeh’d be mad"
15858,"ter try an’ rob it.” Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day,"
15859,the enchanted repository of a trove of gold he had never known he
15860,"possessed, and never for an instant could he have dreamed that he"
15861,would return to steal. . . . But within seconds they were standing
15862,in the vast marble hall of the bank.
15863,"The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools,"
15864,"serving the first customers of the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers"
15865,headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold coin
15866,through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her
15867,on the pretext of explaining features of the hall to Ron.
15868,"The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in"
15869,"particular, “Leprechaun,” and then greeted Travers, who passed over"
15870,"a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back to him."
15871,Hermione stepped forward.
15872,"“Madam Lestrange!” said the goblin, evidently startled. “Dear"
15873,me! How — how may I help you today?”
15874,"“I wish to enter my vault,” said Hermione."
15875,The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around.
15876,"Not only was Travers hanging back, watching, but several other"
15877,goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.
15878,“You have . . . identification?” asked the goblin.
15879,“Identification? I — I have never been asked for identification
15880,before!” said Hermione.
15881,“They know!” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear. “They must have
15882,been warned there might be an impostor!”
15883,"“Your wand will do, madam,” said the goblin. He held out a"
15884,"slightly trembling hand, and in a dreadful blast of realization Harry"
15885, 530  
15886,GRINGOTTS
15887,knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix’s wand
15888,had been stolen.
15889,"“Act now, act now,” whispered Griphook in Harry’s ear, “the Im-"
15890,perius Curse!”
15891,"Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed"
15892,"it at the old goblin, and whispered, for the first time in his life,"
15893,“Imperio!”
15894,"A curious sensation shot down Harry’s arm, a feeling of tingling"
15895,"warmth that seemed to flow from his mind, down the sinews and"
15896,veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just cast. The
15897,"goblin took Bellatrix’s wand, examined it closely, and then said, “Ah,"
15898,"you have had a new wand made, Madam Lestrange!”"
15899,"“What?” said Hermione. “No, no, that’s mine —”"
15900,"“A new wand?” said Travers, approaching the counter again; still"
15901,the goblins all around were watching. “But how could you have
15902,"done, which wandmaker did you use?”"
15903,"Harry acted without thinking: Pointing his wand at Travers, he"
15904,"muttered, “Imperio!” once more."
15905,"“Oh yes, I see,” said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix’s wand,"
15906,"“yes, very handsome. And is it working well? I always think wands"
15907,"require a little breaking in, don’t you?”"
15908,"Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry’s enormous"
15909,relief she accepted the bizarre turn of events without comment.
15910,The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a
15911,younger goblin approached.
15912,"“I shall need the Clankers,” he told the goblin, who dashed away"
15913,and returned a moment later with a leather bag that seemed to be
15914,"full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. “Good, good!"
15915,"So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange,” said the old goblin,"
15916, 531   
15917,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15918,"hopping down off his stool and vanishing from sight, “I shall take"
15919,you to your vault.”
15920,"He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily to-"
15921,"ward them, the contents of the leather bag still jingling. Travers"
15922,was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open.
15923,Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding
15924,Travers with confusion.
15925,“Wait — Bogrod!”
15926,Another goblin came scurrying around the counter.
15927,"“We have instructions,” he said with a bow to Hermione. “For-"
15928,"give me, Madam, but there have been special orders regarding the"
15929,vault of Lestrange.”
15930,"He whispered urgently in Bogrod’s ear, but the Imperiused goblin"
15931,shook him off.
15932,“I am aware of the instructions. Madam Lestrange wishes to
15933,"visit her vault. . . . Very old family . . . old clients . . . This way,"
15934,please . . .”
15935,"And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors"
15936,"leading off the hall. Harry looked back at Travers, who was still"
15937,"rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his deci-"
15938,"sion: With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them,"
15939,walking meekly in their wake as they reached the door and passed
15940,"into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with flam-"
15941,ing torches.
15942,"“We’re in trouble; they suspect,” said Harry as the door slammed"
15943,behind them and he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook
15944,jumped down from his shoulders; neither Travers nor Bogrod
15945,showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry
15946,"Potter in their midst. “They’re Imperiused,” he added, in response"
15947, 532  
15948,GRINGOTTS
15949,"to Hermione and Ron’s confused queries about Travers and Bogrod,"
15950,who were both now standing there looking blank. “I don’t think I
15951,"did it strongly enough, I don’t know. . . .”"
15952,"And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bel-"
15953,latrix Lestrange shrieking at him when he had first tried to use an
15954,"Unforgivable Curse: “You need to mean them, Potter!”"
15955,"“What do we do?” asked Ron. “Shall we get out now, while we"
15956,can?”
15957,"“If we can,” said Hermione, looking back toward the door into"
15958,"the main hall, beyond which who knew what was happening."
15959,"“We’ve got this far, I say we go on,” said Harry."
15960,"“Good!” said Griphook. “So, we need Bogrod to control the cart;"
15961,I no longer have the authority. But there will not be room for the
15962,wizard.”
15963,Harry pointed his wand at Travers.
15964,“Imperio!”
15965,The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart
15966,pace.
15967,“What are you making him do?”
15968,"“Hide,” said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who"
15969,whistled to summon a little cart that came trundling along the
15970,tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could
15971,hear shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered
15972,"into it, Bogrod in front with Griphook, Harry, Ron, and Hermione"
15973,crammed together in the back.
15974,"With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed: They hurtled"
15975,"past Travers, who was wriggling into a crack in the wall, then the"
15976,"cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages,"
15977,sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over
15978, 533  
15979,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
15980,the rattling of the cart on the tracks: His hair flew behind him as
15981,"they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the earth,"
15982,but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous
15983,"footprints behind them; the more he thought about it, the more"
15984,"foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, to have"
15985,"brought along Bellatrix’s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who"
15986,had stolen it —
15987,They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Grin-
15988,"gotts; they took a hairpin bend at speed and saw ahead of them, with"
15989,"seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry heard"
15990,"Griphook shout, “No!” but there was no braking: They zoomed"
15991,through it. Water filled Harry’s eyes and mouth: He could not see
15992,"or breathe: Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped over and they"
15993,were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces
15994,"against the passage wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt"
15995,"himself glide back toward the ground as though weightless, landing"
15996,painlessly on the rocky passage floor.
15997,"“C-Cushioning Charm,” Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her"
15998,"to her feet, but to Harry’s horror he saw that she was no longer Bella-"
15999,"trix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping wet and com-"
16000,pletely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were
16001,"realizing it as they looked at each other, feeling their own faces."
16002,"“The Thief ’s Downfall!” said Griphook, clambering to his feet"
16003,"and looking back at the deluge onto the tracks, which, Harry knew"
16004,"now, had been more than water. “It washes away all enchantment,"
16005,all magical concealment! They know there are impostors in Grin-
16006,"gotts, they have set off defenses against us!”"
16007,"Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag,"
16008,and hurriedly thrust his own hand under his jacket to make sure he
16009, 534   
16010,GRINGOTTS
16011,had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see Bogrod
16012,shaking his head in bewilderment: The Thief ’s Downfall seemed to
16013,have lifted the Imperius Curse.
16014,"“We need him,” said Griphook, “we cannot enter the vault with-"
16015,out a Gringotts goblin. And we need the Clankers!”
16016,“Imperio!” Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone
16017,passage as he felt again the sense of heady control that flowed from
16018,"brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his be-"
16019,"fuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron"
16020,hurried to pick up the leather bag of metal tools.
16021,"“Harry, I think I can hear people coming!” said Hermione, and"
16022,"she pointed Bellatrix’s wand at the waterfall and cried, “Protego!”"
16023,They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water as it
16024,flew up the passageway.
16025,"“Good thinking,” said Harry. “Lead the way, Griphook!”"
16026,“How are we going to get out again?” Ron asked as they hurried
16027,"on foot into the darkness after the goblin, Bogrod panting in their"
16028,wake like an old dog.
16029,"“Let’s worry about that when we have to,” said Harry. He was"
16030,trying to listen: He thought he could hear something clanking and
16031,"moving around nearby. “Griphook, how much farther?”"
16032,"“Not far, Harry Potter, not far . . .”"
16033,And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had
16034,"been prepared, but which still brought all of them to a halt."
16035,"A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them,"
16036,barring access to four or five of the deepest vaults in the place. The
16037,beast’s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long incarcera-
16038,tion under the ground; its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs
16039,bore heavy cuffs from which chains led to enormous pegs driven
16040, 535   
16041,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16042,"deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked wings, folded close to its"
16043,"body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it"
16044,"turned its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made"
16045,"the rock tremble, opened its mouth, and spat a jet of fire that sent"
16046,them running back up the passageway.
16047,"“It is partially blind,” panted Griphook, “but even more savage"
16048,"for that. However, we have the means to control it. It has learned"
16049,what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.”
16050,"Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a"
16051,"number of small metal instruments that when shaken made a loud,"
16052,ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils. Griphook handed
16053,them out: Bogrod accepted his meekly.
16054,"“You know what to do,” Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermi-"
16055,"one. “It will expect pain when it hears the noise: It will retreat, and"
16056,Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.”
16057,"They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers,"
16058,"and the noise echoed off the rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that"
16059,the inside of Harry’s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. The
16060,"dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see"
16061,"it trembling, and as they drew nearer he saw the scars made by vi-"
16062,"cious slashes across its face, and guessed that it had been taught to"
16063,fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers.
16064,"“Make him press his hand to the door!” Griphook urged Harry,"
16065,"who turned his wand again upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed,"
16066,"pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault melted away"
16067,to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with
16068,"golden coins and goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures"
16069,"— some with long spines, others with drooping wings — potions"
16070,"in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown."
16071, 536   
16072,GRINGOTTS
16073,"“Search, fast!” said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault."
16074,"He had described Hufflepuff ’s cup to Ron and Hermione, but if"
16075,"it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did"
16076,"not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around,"
16077,"however, before there was a muffled clunk from behind them: The"
16078,"door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they were"
16079,plunged into total darkness.
16080,"“No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!” said Griphook as"
16081,"Ron gave a shout of surprise. “Light your wands, can’t you? And"
16082,"hurry, we have very little time!”"
16083,“Lumos!”
16084,Harry shone his lit wand around the vault: Its beam fell upon
16085,glittering jewels; he saw the fake sword of Gryffindor lying on a
16086,high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit
16087,"their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects sur-"
16088,rounding them.
16089,"“Harry, could this be — ? Aargh!”"
16090,"Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her"
16091,"in time to see a jeweled goblet tumbling from her grip. But as it fell,"
16092,"it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, with a"
16093,"great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every"
16094,"direction, the original impossible to discern amongst them."
16095,"“It burned me!” moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers."
16096,“They have added Gemino and Flagrante Curses!” said Griphook.
16097,"“Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are"
16098,"worthless — and if you continue to handle the treasure, you will"
16099,eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding gold!”
16100,"“Okay, don’t touch anything!” said Harry desperately, but even as"
16101,"he said it, Ron accidentally nudged one of the fallen goblets with his"
16102, 537  
16103,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16104,"foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron hopped on the"
16105,"spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal."
16106,"“Stand still, don’t move!” said Hermione, clutching at Ron."
16107,"“Just look around!” said Harry. “Remember, the cup’s small and"
16108,"gold, it’s got a badger engraved on it, two handles — otherwise see"
16109,"if you can spot Ravenclaw’s symbol anywhere, the eagle —”"
16110,"They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning"
16111,cautiously on the spot. It was impossible not to brush up against
16112,anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the
16113,"ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely"
16114,"room to place their feet, and the glowing gold blazed with heat,"
16115,so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry’s wandlight passed over
16116,shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling;
16117,"higher and higher he raised the beam, until suddenly it found an"
16118,object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.
16119,"“It’s there, it’s up there!”"
16120,"Ron and Hermione pointed their wands at it too, so that the little"
16121,golden cup sparkled in a three-way spotlight: the cup that had be-
16122,"longed to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the possession of"
16123,"Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle."
16124,“And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching
16125,anything?” asked Ron.
16126,"“Accio Cup!” cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her"
16127,desperation what Griphook had told them during their planning
16128,sessions.
16129,"“No use, no use!” snarled the goblin."
16130,"“Then what do we do?” said Harry, glaring at the goblin. “If you"
16131,"want the sword, Griphook, then you’ll have to help us more than —"
16132,"wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it here!”"
16133, 538 
16134,GRINGOTTS
16135,"Hermione fumbled inside her robes, drew out the beaded bag,"
16136,"rummaged for a few seconds, then removed the shining sword."
16137,Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to
16138,"a silver flagon nearby, which did not multiply."
16139,“If I can just poke the sword through a handle — but how am I
16140,going to get up there?”
16141,The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any
16142,"of them, even Ron, who was tallest. The heat from the enchanted"
16143,"treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry’s face and back"
16144,as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard
16145,"the dragon roar on the other side of the vault door, and the sound"
16146,of clanking growing louder and louder.
16147,They were truly trapped now: There was no way out except
16148,"through the door, and a horde of goblins seemed to be approach-"
16149,ing on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw
16150,terror in their faces.
16151,"“Hermione,” said Harry as the clanking grew louder, “I’ve got to"
16152,"get up there, we’ve got to get rid of it —”"
16153,"She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, “Levi-"
16154,corpus.”
16155,"Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and"
16156,"replicas burst out of it like white-hot bodies, filling the cramped"
16157,"space. With screams of pain Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins"
16158,"were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate."
16159,"Half buried in a rising tide of red-hot treasure, they struggled and"
16160,yelled as Harry thrust the sword through the handle of Hufflepuff ’s
16161,"cup, hooking it onto the blade."
16162,"“Impervius!” screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself,"
16163,"Ron, and the goblins from the burning metal."
16164, 539   
16165,CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX
16166,Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down: Ron and Her-
16167,"mione were waist-deep in treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from"
16168,"slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk out of sight"
16169,and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view.
16170,Harry seized Griphook’s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin
16171,"emerged by degrees, howling."
16172,"“Liberacorpus!” yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook"
16173,"landed on the surface of the swelling treasure, and the sword flew"
16174,out of Harry’s hand.
16175,"“Get it!” Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his"
16176,"skin, as Griphook clambered onto his shoulders again, determined"
16177,to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. “Where’s the sword?
16178,It had the cup on it!”
16179,The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafen-
16180,ing — it was too late —
16181,“There!”
16182,"It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and"
16183,in that instant Harry knew that the goblin had never expected them
16184,to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of Harry’s
16185,"hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning"
16186,"gold, Griphook seized the hilt of the sword and swung it high out"
16187,of Harry’s reach.
16188,"The tiny golden cup, skewered by the handle on the sword’s blade,"
16189,"was flung into the air. The goblin still astride him, Harry dived and"
16190,"caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not"
16191,"relinquish it, even while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his"
16192,"fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the vault opened up"
16193,again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding

16196,"avalanche of fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, and Hermione"
16197,into the outer chamber.
16198,"Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and"
16199,"still borne along on the swell of replicating treasure, Harry shoved"
16200,"the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but"
16201,Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry’s shoulders the moment he
16202,"could, he had sprinted for cover amongst the surrounding goblins,"
16203,"brandishing the sword and crying, “Thieves! Thieves! Help! Thieves!”"
16204,"He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom"
16205,were holding daggers and who accepted him without question.
16206,"Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew"
16207,that the only way out was through.
16208,"“Stupefy!” he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in: Jets"
16209,"of red light flew into the crowd of goblins, and some toppled over,"
16210,"but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards running"
16211,around the corner.
16212,"The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over"
16213,"the goblins: The wizards fled, doubled-up, back the way they had"
16214,"come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his"
16215,"wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled,"
16216,“Relashio!”
16217,The cuffs broke open with loud bangs.
16218,"“This way!” Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at"
16219,"the advancing goblins, he sprinted toward the blind dragon."
16220,“Harry — Harry — what are you doing?” cried Hermione.
16221,"“Get up, climb up, come on —”"
16222,The dragon had not realized that it was free: Harry’s foot found
16223,the crook of its hind leg and he pulled himself up onto its back.

16226,The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He
16227,stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed
16228,"on behind them, and a second later the dragon became aware that"
16229,it was untethered.
16230,"With a roar it reared: Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly"
16231,"as he could to the jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the"
16232,"shrieking goblins aside like skittles, and it soared into the air. Harry,"
16233,"Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the ceiling as"
16234,"it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins"
16235,hurled daggers that glanced off its flanks.
16236,"“We’ll never get out, it’s too big!” Hermione screamed, but the"
16237,"dragon opened its mouth and belched flame again, blasting the"
16238,"tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer"
16239,force the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry’s eyes
16240,were shut tight against the heat and dust: Deafened by the crash-
16241,"ing of rock and the dragon’s roars, he could only cling to its back,"
16242,expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione
16243,"yelling, “Defodio!”"
16244,"She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out"
16245,"the ceiling as it struggled upward toward the fresher air, away from"
16246,"the shrieking and clanking goblins: Harry and Ron copied her,"
16247,blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the
16248,"underground lake, and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to"
16249,"sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind them the passage"
16250,"was full of the dragon’s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of"
16251,"rock, gigantic fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins"
16252,"seemed to be growing more muffled, while ahead, the dragon’s fire"
16253,kept their progress clear —
16254,  542   
16255,GRINGOTTS
16256,"And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the"
16257,"dragon’s brute strength, they had blasted their way out of the passage"
16258,into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards shrieked and ran for
16259,"cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings: Turning"
16260,its horned head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond
16261,"the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still"
16262,"clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leav-"
16263,"ing them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered"
16264,into Diagon Alley and launched itself into the sky.

16267,THE FINAL
16268,HIDING PLACE
16269,T      here was no means of steering; the dragon could not see where
16270,"it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or rolled"
16271,in midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its broad back.
16272,"Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, London unfurling"
16273,"below them like a gray-and-green map, Harry’s overwhelming feeling"
16274,was of gratitude for an escape that had seemed impossible. Crouching
16275,"low over the beast’s neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and"
16276,"the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the"
16277,"dragon’s wings beating the air like the sails of a windmill. Behind him,"
16278,"whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept swearing at"
16279,"the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing."
16280,"After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread"
16281,"that the dragon was going to throw them off, for it seemed intent"
16282,on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison
16283,as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dis-
16284,mount remained rather frightening. He had no idea how long
16285,  544   
16286,THE FINAL HIDING PLACE
16287,"dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon,"
16288,"which could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He"
16289,"glanced around constantly, imagining that he could feel his scar"
16290,prickling. . . .
16291,How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had
16292,broken into the Lestranges’ vault? How soon would the goblins of
16293,Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what
16294,"had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden"
16295,"cup was missing? Voldemort would know, at last, that they were"
16296,hunting Horcruxes. . . .
16297,The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air: It climbed
16298,"steadily until they were flying through wisps of chilly cloud, and"
16299,Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which were
16300,"cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over"
16301,"countryside parceled out in patches of green and brown, over roads"
16302,and rivers winding through the landscape like strips of matte and
16303,glossy ribbon.
16304,“What do you reckon it’s looking for?” Ron yelled as they flew
16305,farther and farther north.
16306,"“No idea,” Harry bellowed back. His hands were numb with"
16307,cold but he did not dare attempt to shift his grip. He had been
16308,wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast
16309,"sail beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold"
16310,"and numb, not to mention desperately hungry and thirsty. When,"
16311,"he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would need"
16312,"sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had"
16313,three highly edible humans sitting on its back?
16314,"The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and"
16315,"still the dragon flew, cities and towns gliding out of sight beneath"
16316, 545  
16317,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
16318,"them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a great dark"
16319,cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to
16320,the dragon’s back.
16321,"“Is it my imagination,” shouted Ron after a considerable stretch"
16322,"of silence, “or are we losing height?”"
16323,"Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes,"
16324,coppery in the sunset. The landscape seemed to grow larger and
16325,"more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and he"
16326,wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the
16327,flashes of reflected sunlight.
16328,"Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, hon-"
16329,"ing in, it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes."
16330,“I say we jump when it gets low enough!” Harry called back to
16331,the others. “Straight into the water before it realizes we’re here!”
16332,"They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could see the"
16333,dragon’s wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water.
16334,“NOW!”
16335,He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst
16336,toward the surface of the lake; the drop was greater than he had
16337,"estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a"
16338,"freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and"
16339,"emerged, panting, to see enormous ripples emanating in circles from"
16340,the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The dragon did
16341,"not seem to have noticed anything: It was already fifty feet away,"
16342,swooping low over the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout.
16343,"As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and gasping, from the"
16344,"depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and"
16345,landed at last on a distant bank.
16346,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione struck out for the opposite shore. The"
16347, 546   
16348,THE FINAL HIDING PLACE
16349,lake did not seem to be deep: Soon it was more a question of fighting
16350,"their way through reeds and mud than swimming, and at last they"
16351,"flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass."
16352,"Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry"
16353,"could have happily lain down and slept, he staggered to his feet,"
16354,"drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells"
16355,around them.
16356,"When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time"
16357,that he had seen them properly since escaping from the vault. Both
16358,"had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their cloth-"
16359,ing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed
16360,essence of dittany onto their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry
16361,"the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin juice she had"
16362,"brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them."
16363,They changed and then gulped down the juice.
16364,"“Well, on the upside,” said Ron finally, who was sitting watch-"
16365,"ing the skin on his hands regrow, “we got the Horcrux. On the"
16366,downside —”
16367,"“— no sword,” said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped"
16368,dittany through the singed hole in his jeans onto the angry burn
16369,beneath.
16370,"“No sword,” repeated Ron. “That double-crossing little scab . . .”"
16371,Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he
16372,had just taken off and set it down on the grass in front of them.
16373,"Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles"
16374,of juice.
16375,"“At least we can’t wear it this time, that’d look a bit weird hang-"

16377,his hand.

16380,"Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank, where the"
16381,dragon was still drinking.
16382,"“What’ll happen to it, do you think?” she asked. “Will it be all"
16383,right?”
16384,"“You sound like Hagrid,” said Ron. “It’s a dragon, Hermione, it"
16385,can look after itself. It’s us we need to worry about.”
16386,“What do you mean?”
16387,"“Well, I don’t know how to break this to you,” said Ron, “but I"
16388,think they might have noticed we broke into Gringotts.”
16389,"All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was dif-"
16390,"ficult to stop. Harry’s ribs ached, he felt lightheaded with hunger,"
16391,but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed
16392,until his throat was raw.
16393,"“What are we going to do, though?” said Hermione finally, hic-"
16394,"cuping herself back to seriousness. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-"
16395,Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!”
16396,“Maybe they’ll be too scared to tell him?” said Ron hopefully.
16397,“Maybe they’ll cover up —”
16398,"The sky, the smell of lake water, the sound of Ron’s voice were"
16399,extinguished: Pain cleaved Harry’s head like a sword stroke. He was
16400,"standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards faced him,"
16401,"and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure."
16402,"“What did you say to me?” His voice was high and cold, but fury"
16403,and fear burned inside him. The one thing he had dreaded — but
16404,"it could not be true, he could not see how . . ."
16405,"The goblin was trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above"
16406,his.
16407,“Say it again!” murmured Voldemort. “Say it again!”
16408,  548  
16409,THE FINAL HIDING PLACE
16410,"“M-my Lord,” stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with ter-"
16411,"ror, “m-my Lord . . . we t-tried t-to st-stop them. . . . Im-impostors,"
16412,my Lord . . . broke — broke into the — into the Lestranges’
16413,v-vault. . . .”
16414,“Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of
16415,revealing impostors? Who were they?”
16416,“It was . . . it was . . . the P-Potter b-boy and t-two accom-
16417,plices. . . .”
16418,"“And they took?” he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping"
16419,him. “Tell me! What did they take?”
16420,"“A . . . a s-small golden c-cup, m-my Lord . . .”"
16421,"The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger’s:"
16422,"He was crazed, frenzied, it could not be true, it was impossible, no-"
16423,body had ever known: How was it possible that the boy could have
16424,discovered his secret?
16425,The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted
16426,"through the room; the kneeling goblin rolled over, dead; the watching"
16427,"wizards scattered before him, terrified: Bellatrix and Lucius Malfoy"
16428,"threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and"
16429,"again his wand fell, and those who were left were slain, all of them,"
16430,"for bringing him this news, for hearing about the golden cup —"
16431,"Alone amongst the dead he stormed up and down, and they"
16432,"passed before him in vision: his treasures, his safeguards, his anchors"
16433,to immortality — the diary was destroyed and the cup was stolen:
16434,"What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know,"
16435,"had he already acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore"
16436,"at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had always suspected him;"
16437,"Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was"

16439,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
16440,"his now, yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through"
16441,"the boy, the boy —"
16442,"But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord"
16443,"Voldemort, would have known, would have felt it? He, the greatest"
16444,"wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer of Dumble-"
16445,"dore and of how many other worthless, nameless men: How could"
16446,"Lord Voldemort not have known, if he, himself, most important"
16447,"and precious, had been attacked, mutilated?"
16448,"True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but"
16449,"he had thought that was because he had no body to feel, being less"
16450,"than ghost. . . . No, surely, the rest were safe. . . . The other Hor-"
16451,cruxes must be intact. . . .
16452,"But he must know, he must be sure. . . . He paced the room,"
16453,"kicking aside the goblin’s corpse as he passed, and the pictures"
16454,"blurred and burned in his boiling brain: the lake, the shack, and"
16455,Hogwarts —
16456,A modicum of calm cooled his rage now: How could the boy
16457,know that he had hidden the ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had
16458,"ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the"
16459,"connection, the killings had never been traced to him: The ring,"
16460,"surely, was safe."
16461,"And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or"
16462,penetrate its protection? The idea of the locket being stolen was
16463,absurd. . . .
16464,As for the school: He alone knew where in Hogwarts he had
16465,"stowed the Horcrux, because he alone had plumbed the deepest"
16466,secrets of that place. . . .
16467,"And there was still Nagini, who must remain close now, no longer"
16468,"sent to do his bidding, under his protection. . . ."
16469, 550   
16470,THE FINAL HIDING PLACE
16471,"But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his"

16473,"cruxes. . . . A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must"
16474,undertake alone . . .
16475,"Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old"
16476,unease flickered inside him. Dumbledore had known his middle
16477,name. . . . Dumbledore might have made the connection with the
16478,"Gaunts. . . . Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of"
16479,"his hiding places, it was there that he would go first. . . ."
16480,"The lake, surely impossible . . . though was there a slight possibil-"
16481,"ity that Dumbledore might have known some of his past misdeeds,"
16482,through the orphanage.
16483,And Hogwarts . . . but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe;
16484,it would be impossible for Potter to enter Hogsmeade without detec-
16485,"tion, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to alert"
16486,Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. . . . To
16487,"tell Snape why the boy might return would be foolish, of course; it"
16488,had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy: Didn’t their
16489,stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust?
16490,"He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with"
16491,him: He would not be parted from the snake anymore . . . and he
16492,"strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark gar-"
16493,den where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue
16494,and it slithered out to join him like a long shadow. . . .
16495,Harry’s eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the pres-
16496,"ent: He was lying on the bank of the lake in the setting sun, and"
16497,Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their
16498,"worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sud-"
16499,den excursion into Voldemort’s mind had not passed unnoticed. He
16500, 551    
16501,CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN
16502,"struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he was still wet to his"
16503,"skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and"
16504,"the lake, deep blue shot with gold in the failing sun."
16505,“He knows.” His own voice sounded strange and low after Vol-
16506,"demort’s high screams. “He knows, and he’s going to check where"
16507,"the others are, and the last one,” he was already on his feet, “is at"
16508,Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it.”
16509,“What?”
16510,"Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried."
16511,“But what did you see? How do you know?”
16512,"“I saw him find out about the cup, I — I was in his head, he’s” —"
16513,"Harry remembered the killings — “he’s seriously angry, and scared"
16514,"too, he can’t understand how we knew, and now he’s going to check"
16515,"the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is"
16516,"safest, because Snape’s there, because it’ll be so hard not to be seen"
16517,"getting in, I think he’ll check that one last, but he could still be"
16518,there within hours —”
16519,"“Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?” asked Ron, now scram-"
16520,bling to his feet too.
16521,"“No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn’t think"
16522,about exactly where it is —”
16523,"“Wait, wait!” cried Hermione as Ron caught up the Horcrux and"
16524,"Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak again. “We can’t just go, we"
16525,"haven’t got a plan, we need to —”"
16526,"“We need to get going,” said Harry firmly. He had been hop-"
16527,"ing to sleep, looking forward to getting into the new tent, but that"
16528,was impossible now. “Can you imagine what he’s going to do once
16529,he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the

16537,“But we don’t really fit —”
16538,"“It’ll be dark, no one’s going to notice our feet.”"
16539,The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water:
16540,The dragon had drunk its fill and risen into the air. They paused in
16541,"their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now black"
16542,"against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby"
16543,mountain. Then Hermione walked forward and took her place be-

16561,"Harry’s body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had"
16562,"caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the"
16563,door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and
16564,"hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street, their wands aloft."
16565,Harry seized Ron’s wrist as he raised his wand; there were too
16566, 554   
16567,THE MISSING MIRROR
16568,many of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their
16569,position. One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream
16570,"stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains."
16571,“Accio Cloak!” roared one of the Death Eaters.
16572,"Harry seized its folds, but it made no attempt to escape: The"
16573,Summoning Charm had not worked on it.
16574,"“Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?” yelled the Death Eater"
16575,"who had tried the charm, and then to his fellows, “Spread out. He’s"
16576,here.”
16577,"Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Her-"
16578,"mione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street,"
16579,and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the
16580,"darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams"
16581,of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters’ searching
16582,wands.
16583,“Let’s just leave!” Hermione whispered. “Disapparate now!”
16584,"“Great idea,” said Ron, but before Harry could reply a Death"
16585,"Eater shouted,"
16586,"“We know you’re here, Potter, and there’s no getting away! We’ll"
16587,find you!”
16588,"“They were ready for us,” whispered Harry. “They set up that"
16589,spell to tell them we’d come. I reckon they’ve done something to
16590,"keep us here, trap us —”"
16591,“What about dementors?” called another Death Eater. “Let ’em
16592,"have free rein, they’d find him quick enough!”"
16593,“The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hand but his —”
16594,“— an’ dementors won’t kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter’s
16595,"life, not his soul. He’ll be easier to kill if he’s been Kissed first!”"
16596,There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry: To repel
16597,  555   
16598,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
16599,"dementors they would have to produce Patronuses, which would"
16600,give them away immediately.
16601,"“We’re going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!” Hermione"
16602,whispered.
16603,"Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over"
16604,the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the
16605,"stars, which vanished. In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take"
16606,"hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot."
16607,The air through which they needed to move seemed to have
16608,become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had
16609,cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into
16610,"Harry’s flesh. He, Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street,"
16611,"groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then,"
16612,"around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more"
16613,"of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their"
16614,"surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rot-"
16615,ting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure
16616,"of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those"
16617,"dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the air,"
16618,closing in —
16619,"He raised his wand: He could not, would not, suffer the Demen-"
16620,"tor’s Kiss, whatever happened afterward. It was of Ron and Hermi-"
16621,"one that he thought as he whispered, “Expecto Patronum!”"
16622,The silver stag burst from his wand and charged: The dementors
16623,scattered and there was a triumphant yell from somewhere out of
16624,sight.
16625,"“It’s him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, it was a"
16626,stag!
16627,"The dementors had retreated, the stars were popping out again,"
16628,  556 
16629,THE MISSING MIRROR
16630,and the footsteps of the Death Eaters were becoming louder; but be-
16631,"fore Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a grinding"
16632,"of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-hand side of the narrow"
16633,"street, and a rough voice said, “Potter, in here, quick!”"
16634,He obeyed without hesitation: The three of them hurtled through
16635,the open doorway.
16636,"“Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!” muttered a tall figure,"
16637,passing them on his way into the street and slamming the door
16638,behind him.
16639,"Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the"
16640,"stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar"
16641,of the Hog’s Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through
16642,"a second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they"
16643,climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened onto a sitting room
16644,"with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a"
16645,single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room
16646,with a kind of vacant sweetness.
16647,Shouts reached them from the street below. Still wearing the
16648,"Invisibility Cloak, they crept toward the grimy window and looked"
16649,"down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the Hog’s"
16650,"Head’s barman, was the only person not wearing a hood."
16651,“So what?” he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. “So
16652,"what? You send dementors down my street, I’ll send a Patronus"
16653,"back at ’em! I’m not having ’em near me, I’ve told you that, I’m not"
16654,having it!”
16655,“That wasn’t your Patronus!” said a Death Eater. “That was a
16656,"stag, it was Potter’s!”"
16657,"“Stag!” roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. “Stag! You"
16658,idiot — Expecto Patronum!”
16659,  557 
16660,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
16661,Something huge and horned erupted from the wand: Head
16662,"down, it charged toward the High Street and out of sight."
16663,"“That’s not what I saw —” said the Death Eater, though with"
16664,less certainty.
16665,"“Curfew’s been broken, you heard the noise,” one of his com-"
16666,panions told the barman. “Someone was out in the street against
16667,regulations —”
16668,"“If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your"
16669,curfew!”
16670,“You set off the Caterwauling Charm?”
16671,“What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for
16672,"sticking my nose out my own front door? Do it, then, if you want"
16673,to! But I hope for your sakes you haven’t pressed your little Dark
16674,Marks and summoned him. He’s not going to like being called here
16675,"for me and my old cat, is he, now?”"
16676,"“Don’t you worry about us,” said one of the Death Eaters, “worry"
16677,"about yourself, breaking curfew!”"
16678,“And where will you lot traffick potions and poisons when my
16679,pub’s closed down? What’ll happen to your little sidelines then?”
16680,“Are you threatening — ?”
16681,"“I keep my mouth shut, it’s why you come here, isn’t it?”"
16682,“I still say I saw a stag Patronus!” shouted the first Death Eater.
16683,"“Stag?” roared the barman. “It’s a goat, idiot!”"
16684,"“All right, we made a mistake,” said the second Death Eater."
16685,“Break curfew again and we won’t be so lenient!”
16686,The Death Eaters strode back toward the High Street. Hermi-
16687,"one moaned with relief, wove out from under the Cloak, and sat"
16688,"down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains tight shut,"
16689,then pulled the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the
16690, 558  
16691,THE MISSING MIRROR
16692,"barman down below, rebolting the door of the bar, then climbing"
16693,the stairs.
16694,Harry’s attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece:
16695,"a small, rectangular mirror propped on top of it, right beneath the"
16696,portrait of the girl.
16697,The barman entered the room.
16698,"“You bloody fools,” he said gruffly, looking from one to the other"
16699,"of them. “What were you thinking, coming here?”"
16700,"“Thank you,” said Harry. “We can’t thank you enough. You saved"
16701,our lives.”
16702,"The barman grunted. Harry approached him, looking up into the"
16703,"face, trying to see past the long, stringy, wire-gray hair and beard."
16704,"He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a pierc-"
16705,"ing, brilliant blue."
16706,“It’s your eye I’ve been seeing in the mirror.”
16707,There was silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at
16708,each other.
16709,“You sent Dobby.”
16710,The barman nodded and looked around for the elf.
16711,“Thought he’d be with you. Where’ve you left him?”
16712,"“He’s dead,” said Harry. “Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.”"
16713,"The barman’s face was impassive. After a few moments he said,"
16714,“I’m sorry to hear it. I liked that elf.”
16715,"He turned away, lighting lamps with prods of his wand, not look-"
16716,ing at any of them.
16717,"“You’re Aberforth,” said Harry to the man’s back."
16718,"He neither confirmed nor denied it, but bent to light the fire."
16719,"“How did you get this?” Harry asked, walking across to Sirius’s"
16720,"mirror, the twin of the one he had broken nearly two years before."
16721, 559   
16722,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
16723,"“Bought it from Dung ’bout a year ago,” said Aberforth. “Albus"
16724,told me what it was. Been trying to keep an eye out for you.”
16725,Ron gasped.
16726,“The silver doe!” he said excitedly. “Was that you too?”
16727,“What are you talking about?” said Aberforth.
16728,“Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!”
16729,"“Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven’t I just"
16730,proved my Patronus is a goat?”
16731,"“Oh,” said Ron. “Yeah . . . well, I’m hungry!” he added defensively"
16732,as his stomach gave an enormous rumble.
16733,"“I got food,” said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, re-"
16734,"appearing moments later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese,"
16735,"and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in front"
16736,"of the fire. Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was"
16737,"silence but for the crackle of the fire, the clink of goblets, and the"
16738,sound of chewing.
16739,"“Right then,” said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill, and"
16740,Harry and Ron sat slumped dozily in their chairs. “We need to
16741,"think of the best way to get you out of here. Can’t be done by night,"
16742,you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during dark-
16743,"ness: Caterwauling Charm’s set off, they’ll be onto you like bow-"
16744,truckles on doxy eggs. I don’t reckon I’ll be able to pass off a stag
16745,"as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then"
16746,you can put your Cloak back on and set out on foot. Get right out
16747,"of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you’ll be able to Disap-"
16748,parate there. Might see Hagrid. He’s been hiding in a cave up there
16749,with Grawp ever since they tried to arrest him.”
16750,"“We’re not leaving,” said Harry. “We need to get into Hogwarts.”"
16751,"“Don’t be stupid, boy,” said Aberforth."
16752, 560   
16753,THE MISSING MIRROR
16754,"“We’ve got to,” said Harry."
16755,"“What you’ve got to do,” said Aberforth, leaning forward, “is to"
16756,get as far from here as you can.”
16757,“You don’t understand. There isn’t much time. We’ve got to get
16758,"into the castle. Dumbledore — I mean, your brother — wanted"
16759,us —”
16760,The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth’s glasses momen-
16761,"tarily opaque, a bright flat white, and Harry remembered the blind"
16762,"eyes of the giant spider, Aragog."
16763,"“My brother Albus wanted a lot of things,” said Aberforth, “and"
16764,people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his
16765,"grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of the"
16766,country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He’s
16767,"gone where none of this can hurt him, and you don’t owe him"
16768,anything.”
16769,"“You don’t understand,” said Harry again."
16770,"“Oh, don’t I?” said Aberforth quietly. “You don’t think I under-"
16771,stood my own brother? Think you knew Albus better than I did?”
16772,"“I didn’t mean that,” said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with"
16773,exhaustion and from the surfeit of food and wine. “It’s . . . he left
16774,me a job.”
16775,"“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy?"
16776,Sort of thing you’d expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to
16777,do without overstretching themselves?”
16778,Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained.
16779,"“I-it’s not easy, no,” said Harry. “But I’ve got to —”"
16780,"“ ‘Got to’? Why ‘got to’? He’s dead, isn’t he?” said Aberforth"
16781,"roughly. “Let it go, boy, before you follow him! Save yourself!”"
16782,“I can’t.”
16783, 561  
16784,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
16785,“Why not?”
16786,"“I —” Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took"
16787,"the offensive instead. “But you’re fighting too, you’re in the Order"
16788,of the Phoenix —”
16789,"“I was,” said Aberforth. “The Order of the Phoenix is finished."
16790,"You-Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending dif-"
16791,"ferent’s kidding themselves. It’ll never be safe for you here, Potter,"
16792,"he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself."
16793,Best take these two with you.” He jerked a thumb at Ron and Her-
16794,mione. “They’ll be in danger long as they live now everyone knows
16795,they’ve been working with you.”
16796,"“I can’t leave,” said Harry. “I’ve got a job —”"
16797,“Give it to someone else!”
16798,"“I can’t. It’s got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all —”"
16799,"“Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest"
16800,with you?”
16801,"Harry wanted with all his heart to say “Yes,” but somehow the"
16802,simple word would not rise to his lips. Aberforth seemed to know
16803,what he was thinking.
16804,"“I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother’s"
16805,"knee. Secrets and lies, that’s how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was"
16806,a natural.”
16807,The old man’s eyes traveled to the painting of the girl over the
16808,"mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only"
16809,picture in the room. There was no photograph of Albus Dumble-
16810,"dore, nor of anyone else."
16811,“Mr. Dumbledore?” said Hermione rather timidly. “Is that your
16812,sister? Ariana?”
16813, 562  
16814,THE MISSING MIRROR
16815,"“Yes,” said Aberforth tersely. “Been reading Rita Skeeter, have"
16816,"you, missy?”"
16817,Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had
16818,turned red.
16819,"“Elphias Doge mentioned her to us,” said Harry, trying to spare"
16820,Hermione.
16821,"“That old berk,” muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of"
16822,"mead. “Thought the sun shone out of my brother’s every orifice,"
16823,"he did. Well, so did plenty of people, you three included, by the"
16824,looks of it.”
16825,Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and
16826,uncertainties about Dumbledore that had riddled him for months
16827,"now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby’s grave, he had"
16828,"decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated"
16829,"for him by Albus Dumbledore, to accept that he had not been told"
16830,"everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no"
16831,desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would
16832,"deflect him from his purpose. He met Aberforth’s gaze, which was"
16833,so strikingly like his brother’s: The bright blue eyes gave the same
16834,"impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and"
16835,Harry thought that Aberforth knew what he was thinking and de-
16836,spised him for it.
16837,"“Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much,” said Her-"
16838,mione in a low voice.
16839,"“Did he now?” said Aberforth. “Funny thing, how many of the"
16840,people my brother cared about very much ended up in a worse state
16841,than if he’d left ’em well alone.”
16842,“What do you mean?” asked Hermione breathlessly.
16843,  563  
16844,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
16845,"“Never you mind,” said Aberforth."
16846,“But that’s a really serious thing to say!” said Hermione. “Are
16847,you — are you talking about your sister?”
16848,Aberforth glared at her: His lips moved as if he were chewing the
16849,words he was holding back. Then he burst into speech.
16850,"“When my sister was six years old, she was attacked, set upon, by"
16851,"three Muggle boys. They’d seen her doing magic, spying through"
16852,"the back garden hedge: She was a kid, she couldn’t control it, no"
16853,"witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw scared them, I"
16854,"expect. They forced their way through the hedge, and when she"
16855,"couldn’t show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to"
16856,stop the little freak doing it.”
16857,Hermione’s eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly
16858,"sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as Albus, and suddenly terrible in his"
16859,anger and the intensity of his pain.
16860,"“It destroyed her, what they did: She was never right again. She"
16861,"wouldn’t use magic, but she couldn’t get rid of it; it turned inward"
16862,"and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn’t control"
16863,"it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was"
16864,sweet and scared and harmless.
16865,"“And my father went after the bastards that did it,” said Aber-"
16866,"forth, “and attacked them. And they locked him up in Azkaban"
16867,"for it. He never said why he’d done it, because if the Ministry had"
16868,"known what Ariana had become, she’d have been locked up in"
16869,St. Mungo’s for good. They’d have seen her as a serious threat to
16870,"the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with"
16871,magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn’t keep it
16872,in any longer.
16873,"“We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about"
16874, 564 
16875,THE MISSING MIRROR
16876,"she was ill, and my mother looked after her, and tried to keep her"
16877,calm and happy.
16878,"“I was her favorite,” he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy"
16879,seemed to look out through Aberforth’s wrinkles and tangled beard.
16880,"“Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he was home,"
16881,"reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his"
16882,"correspondence with ‘the most notable magical names of the day,’ ”"
16883,Aberforth sneered. “He didn’t want to be bothered with her. She
16884,liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn’t do it for my
16885,"mother, I could get her to calm down when she was in one of her"
16886,"rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me feed the goats."
16887,"“Then, when she was fourteen . . . See, I wasn’t there,” said Ab-"
16888,"erforth. “If I’d been there, I could have calmed her down. She had"
16889,"one of her rages, and my mother wasn’t as young as she was, and . . ."
16890,it was an accident. Ariana couldn’t control it. But my mother was
16891,killed.”
16892,Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not
16893,"want to hear any more, but Aberforth kept talking, and Harry won-"
16894,"dered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; whether,"
16895,"in fact, he had ever spoken about it."
16896,“So that put paid to Albus’s trip round the world with little Doge.
16897,The pair of ’em came home for my mother’s funeral and then Doge
16898,"went off on his own, and Albus settled down as head of the fam-"
16899,ily. Ha!”
16900,Aberforth spat into the fire.
16901,"“I’d have looked after her, I told him so, I didn’t care about school,"
16902,I’d have stayed home and done it. He told me I had to finish my
16903,education and he’d take over from my mother. Bit of a comedown

16908,did all right for a few weeks . . . till he came.”
16909,And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth’s face.
16910,"“Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to,"
16911,someone just as bright and talented as he was. And looking after
16912,"Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all their plans"
16913,"for a new Wizarding order, and looking for Hallows, and whatever"
16914,else it was they were so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of
16915,"all Wizardkind, and if one young girl got neglected, what did that"
16916,"matter, when Albus was working for the greater good?"
16917,"“But after a few weeks of it, I’d had enough, I had. It was nearly"
16918,"time for me to go back to Hogwarts, so I told ’em, both of ’em,"
16919,"face-to-face, like I am to you, now,” and Aberforth looked down at"
16920,"Harry, and it took little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry"
16921,"and angry, confronting his elder brother. “I told him, you’d better"
16922,"give it up now. You can’t move her, she’s in no fit state, you can’t"
16923,"take her with you, wherever it is you’re planning to go, when you’re"
16924,"making your clever speeches, trying to whip yourselves up a follow-"
16925,"ing. He didn’t like that,” said Aberforth, and his eyes were briefly"
16926,occluded by the firelight on the lenses of his glasses: They shone
16927,white and blind again. “Grindelwald didn’t like that at all. He got
16928,"angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying to stand in"
16929,"the way of him and my brilliant brother. . . . Didn’t I understand,"
16930,my poor sister wouldn’t have to be hidden once they’d changed the
16931,"world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the Muggles"
16932,their place?
16933,"“And there was an argument . . . and I pulled out my wand, and"
16934,"he pulled out his, and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my"
16935,"brother’s best friend — and Albus was trying to stop him, and then"
16936,   566    
16937,THE MISSING MIRROR
16938,"all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs"
16939,"set her off, she couldn’t stand it —”"
16940,The color was draining from Aberforth’s face as though he had
16941,suffered a mortal wound.
16942,"“— and I think she wanted to help, but she didn’t really know"
16943,"what she was doing, and I don’t know which of us did it, it could"
16944,have been any of us — and she was dead.”
16945,His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the
16946,"nearest chair. Hermione’s face was wet with tears, and Ron was"
16947,almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion: He
16948,"wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean"
16949,of it.
16950,"“I’m so . . . I’m so sorry,” Hermione whispered."
16951,"“Gone,” croaked Aberforth. “Gone forever.”"
16952,He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat.
16953,"“ ’Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record"
16954,"already, back in his own country, and he didn’t want Ariana set to"
16955,"his account too. And Albus was free, wasn’t he? Free of the burden"
16956,"of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the —”"
16957,"“He was never free,” said Harry."
16958,“I beg your pardon?” said Aberforth.
16959,"“Never,” said Harry. “The night that your brother died, he drank a"
16960,"potion that drove him out of his mind. He started screaming, plead-"
16961,"ing with someone who wasn’t there. ‘Don’t hurt them, please . . ."
16962,hurt me instead.’ ”
16963,Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone
16964,into details about what had happened on the island on the lake: The
16965,events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned
16966,to Hogwarts had eclipsed it so thoroughly.
16967, 567 
16968,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
16969,"“He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I"
16970,"know he did,” said Harry, remembering Dumbledore whimpering,"
16971,pleading. “He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you
16972,"and Ariana. . . . It was torture to him, if you’d seen him then, you"
16973,wouldn’t say he was free.”
16974,Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and
16975,"veined hands. After a long pause he said, “How can you be sure,"
16976,"Potter, that my brother wasn’t more interested in the greater good"
16977,"than in you? How can you be sure you aren’t dispensable, just like"
16978,my little sister?”
16979,A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry’s heart.
16980,"“I don’t believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry,” said Hermione."
16981,"“Why didn’t he tell him to hide, then?” shot back Aberforth."
16982,"“Why didn’t he say to him, ‘Take care of yourself, here’s how to"
16983,survive’?”
16984,"“Because,” said Harry before Hermione could answer, “sometimes"
16985,you’ve got to think about more than your own safety! Sometimes
16986,you’ve got to think about the greater good! This is war!”
16987,"“You’re seventeen, boy!”"
16988,"“I’m of age, and I’m going to keep fighting even if you’ve given"
16989,up!”
16990,“Who says I’ve given up?”
16991,"“ ‘The Order of the Phoenix is finished,’ ” Harry repeated. “ ‘You-"
16992,"Know-Who’s won, it’s over, and anyone who’s pretending different’s"
16993,kidding themselves.’ ”
16994,"“I don’t say I like it, but it’s the truth!”"
16995,"“No, it isn’t,” said Harry. “Your brother knew how to finish You-"
16996,Know-Who and he passed the knowledge on to me. I’m going to
16997,  568   
16998,THE MISSING MIRROR
16999,keep going until I succeed — or I die. Don’t think I don’t know
17000,how this might end. I’ve known it for years.”
17001,"He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He"
17002,merely scowled.
17003,"“We need to get into Hogwarts,” said Harry again. “If you can’t"
17004,"help us, we’ll wait till daybreak, leave you in peace, and try to find"
17005,"a way in ourselves. If you can help us — well, now would be a great"
17006,time to mention it.”
17007,"Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the"
17008,eyes that were so extraordinarily like his brother’s. At last he cleared
17009,"his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and ap-"
17010,proached the portrait of Ariana.
17011,"“You know what to do,” he said."
17012,"She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits"
17013,"usually did, out of the sides of their frames, but along what seemed"
17014,to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her slight
17015,figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness.
17016,“Er — what — ?” began Ron.
17017,"“There’s only one way in now,” said Aberforth. “You must know"
17018,"they’ve got all the old secret passageways covered at both ends, de-"
17019,"mentors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside the"
17020,school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so
17021,heavily guarded. How you expect to do anything once you get inside
17022,"it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his deputies . . . well,"
17023,"that’s your lookout, isn’t it? You say you’re prepared to die.”"
17024,"“But what . . . ?” said Hermione, frowning at Ariana’s picture."
17025,"A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel,"
17026,"and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger"
17027, 569  
17028,CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT
17029,"and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now,"
17030,"someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking ex-"
17031,cited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared
17032,to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped
17033,"and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their"
17034,heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung
17035,"forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tun-"
17036,"nel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his"
17037,"robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave"
17038,"a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, “I"
17039,"knew you’d come! I knew it, Harry!”"
17040,  570   

17042,THE LOST DIADEM
17043,N         eville — what the — how — ?”
17044,"But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with"
17045,yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at
17046,"Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow"
17047,"and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of"
17048,"unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless,"
17049,his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione
17050,"and said again, “I knew you’d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a"
17051,matter of time!”
17052,"“Neville, what’s happened to you?”"
17053,“What? This?” Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the
17054,head. “This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get go-
17055,"ing then? Oh,” he turned to Aberforth, “Ab, there might be a couple"
17056,more people on the way.”
17057,“Couple more?” repeated Aberforth ominously. “What d’you
17058, 571  
17059,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17060,"mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There’s a curfew and a Cater-"
17061,wauling Charm on the whole village!”
17062,"“I know, that’s why they’ll be Apparating directly into the bar,”"
17063,"said Neville. “Just send them down the passage when they get here,"
17064,will you? Thanks a lot.”
17065,Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb
17066,"up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then"
17067,Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.
17068,“I don’t know how to thank you. You’ve saved our lives twice.”
17069,"“Look after ’em, then,” said Aberforth gruffly. “I might not be"
17070,able to save ’em a third time.”
17071,Harry clambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole
17072,behind Ariana’s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other
17073,side: It looked as though the passageway had been there for years.
17074,Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn
17075,"and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across"
17076,the wall.
17077,“How long’s this been here?” Ron asked as they set off. “It isn’t on
17078,"the Marauder’s Map, is it, Harry? I thought there were only seven"
17079,passages in and out of school?”
17080,"“They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,” said"
17081,"Neville. “There’s no chance of getting through any of them now,"
17082,not with curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and demen-
17083,"tors waiting at the exits.” He started walking backward, beaming,"
17084,drinking them in. “Never mind that stuff. . . . Is it true? Did you
17085,"break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It’s everywhere,"
17086,"everyone’s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for"
17087,yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!”
17088,"“Yeah, it’s true,” said Harry."
17089,  572 
17090,THE LOST DIADEM
17091,Neville laughed gleefully.
17092,“What did you do with the dragon?”
17093,"“Released it into the wild,” said Ron. “Hermione was all for keep-"
17094,ing it as a pet —”
17095,"“Don’t exaggerate, Ron —”"
17096,“But what have you been doing? People have been saying you’ve
17097,"just been on the run, Harry, but I don’t think so. I think you’ve"
17098,been up to something.”
17099,"“You’re right,” said Harry, “but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville,"
17100,we haven’t heard anything.”
17101,"“It’s been . . . well, it’s not really like Hogwarts anymore,” said"
17102,"Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. “Do you know"
17103,about the Carrows?”
17104,“Those two Death Eaters who teach here?”
17105,"“They do more than teach,” said Neville. “They’re in charge of"
17106,"all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.”"
17107,“Like Umbridge?”
17108,"“Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all sup-"
17109,posed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They
17110,"don’t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them"
17111,as much as we do.
17112,"“Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against"
17113,"the Dark Arts, except now it’s just the Dark Arts. We’re sup-"
17114,posed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who’ve earned
17115,detentions —”
17116,“What?”
17117,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione’s united voices echoed up and down"
17118,the passage.
17119,"“Yeah,” said Neville. “That’s how I got this one,” he pointed at a"
17120, 573   
17121,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17122,"particularly deep gash in his cheek, “I refused to do it. Some people"
17123,"are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they’ve ever"
17124,"been top in anything, I expect."
17125,"“Alecto, Amycus’s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is com-"
17126,pulsory for everyone. We’ve all got to listen to her explain how
17127,"Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drove"
17128,"wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the"
17129,"natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,” he indicated"
17130,"another slash to his face, “for asking her how much Muggle blood"
17131,she and her brother have got.”
17132,"“Blimey, Neville,” said Ron, “there’s a time and a place for get-"
17133,ting a smart mouth.”
17134,"“You didn’t hear her,” said Neville. “You wouldn’t have stood it"
17135,"either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives"
17136,"everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.”"
17137,"“But they’ve used you as a knife sharpener,” said Ron, wincing"
17138,slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville’s injuries were thrown
17139,into even greater relief.
17140,Neville shrugged.
17141,"“Doesn’t matter. They don’t want to spill too much pure blood,"
17142,so they’ll torture us a bit if we’re mouthy but they won’t actually
17143,kill us.”
17144,"Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was"
17145,saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.
17146,“The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and
17147,relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hos-
17148,tage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The
17149,"Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for"

17153,"“Neville, she’s all right, we’ve seen her —”"
17154,"“Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.”"
17155,"From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized"
17156,it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore’s Army had used to
17157,send one another messages.
17158,"“These have been great,” said Neville, beaming at Hermione."
17159,"“The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove"
17160,them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the
17161,"walls: Dumbledore’s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape"
17162,hated it.”
17163,"“You used to?” said Harry, who had noticed the past tense."
17164,"“Well, it got more difficult as time went on,” said Neville. “We"
17165,"lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter,"
17166,and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed
17167,"to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on"
17168,"me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing"
17169,"a first-year they’d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly."
17170,That scared people off.”
17171,"“No kidding,” muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope"
17172,upward.
17173,"“Yeah, well, I couldn’t ask people to go through what Michael"
17174,"did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting,"
17175,"doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That’s"
17176,"when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose,"
17177,and they went for Gran.”
17178,"“They what?” said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together."
17179,"“Yeah,” said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage"
17180,"was climbing so steeply, “well, you can see their thinking. It had"
17181,"worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave,"

17183,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17184,I s’pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way
17185,"around. Thing was,” he faced them, and Harry was astonished to"
17186,"see that he was grinning, “they bit off a bit more than they could"
17187,"chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought"
17188,"they didn’t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,”"
17189,"Neville laughed, “Dawlish is still in St. Mungo’s and Gran’s on the"
17190,"run. She sent me a letter,” he clapped a hand to the breast pocket"
17191,"of his robes, “telling me she was proud of me, that I’m my parents’"
17192,"son, and to keep it up.”"
17193,"“Cool,” said Ron."
17194,"“Yeah,” said Neville happily. “Only thing was, once they realized"
17195,"they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without"
17196,me after all. I don’t know whether they were planning to kill me or
17197,"send me to Azkaban; either way, I knew it was time to disappear.”"
17198,"“But,” said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, “aren’t — aren’t"
17199,we heading straight back into Hogwarts?”
17200,"“ ’Course,” said Neville. “You’ll see. We’re here.”"
17201,They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of
17202,the passage. Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the
17203,one hidden behind Ariana’s portrait. Neville pushed it open and
17204,"climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out to"
17205,unseen people:
17206,“Look who it is! Didn’t I tell you?”
17207,"As Harry emerged into the room beyond the passage, there were"
17208,"several screams and yells: “HARRY!” “It’s Potter, it’s POTTER!”"
17209,“Ron!” “Hermione!”
17210,"He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and"
17211,"many faces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were en-"

17215,"shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people: They might"
17216,just have won a Quidditch final.
17217,"“Okay, okay, calm down!” Neville called, and as the crowd backed"
17218,"away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings."
17219,"He did not recognize the room at all. It was enormous, and"
17220,looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree
17221,"house, or perhaps a gigantic ship’s cabin. Multicolored hammocks"
17222,were strung from the ceiling and from a balcony that ran around
17223,"the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered"
17224,"in bright tapestry hangings: Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion,"
17225,"emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against"
17226,"yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and"
17227,"green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases,"
17228,"a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a"
17229,large wooden-cased wireless.
17230,“Where are we?”
17231,"“Room of Requirement, of course!” said Neville. “Surpassed it-"
17232,"self, hasn’t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just"
17233,one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and
17234,"this is what I found! Well, it wasn’t exactly like this when I arrived,"
17235,"it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryf-"
17236,findor hangings. But it’s expanded as more and more of the D.A.
17237,have arrived.”
17238,"“And the Carrows can’t get in?” asked Harry, looking around"
17239,for the door.
17240,"“No,” said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized"
17241,until he spoke: Seamus’s face was bruised and puffy. “It’s a proper
17242,"hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can’t get at us, the"
17243,door won’t open. It’s all down to Neville. He really gets this room.
17244, 577   
17245,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17246,"You’ve got to ask it for exactly what you need — like, ‘I don’t want"
17247,any Carrow supporters to be able to get in’ — and it’ll do it for
17248,you! You’ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes! Neville’s
17249,the man!”
17250,"“It’s quite straightforward, really,” said Neville modestly. “I’d"
17251,"been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and"
17252,"wishing I could get something to eat, and that’s when the passage"
17253,to the Hog’s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth.
17254,"He’s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that’s"
17255,the one thing the room doesn’t really do.”
17256,"“Yeah, well, food’s one of the five exceptions to Gamp’s Law of"
17257,"Elemental Transfiguration,” said Ron to general astonishment."
17258,"“So we’ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,” said Sea-"
17259,"mus, “and it just makes more hammocks every time we need them,"
17260,and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started
17261,turning up —”
17262,"“— and thought they’d quite like to wash, yes,” supplied Lav-"
17263,"ender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now"
17264,"that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces."
17265,"Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan,"
17266,"Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner."
17267,"“Tell us what you’ve been up to, though,” said Ernie. “There’ve"
17268,"been so many rumors, we’ve been trying to keep up with you on"
17269,Potterwatch.” He pointed at the wireless. “You didn’t break into
17270,Gringotts?”
17271,“They did!” said Neville. “And the dragon’s true too!”
17272,There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took

17276,“What were you after?” asked Seamus eagerly.
17277,Before any of them could parry the question with one of their
17278,"own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As"
17279,"he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the"
17280,"Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ru-"
17281,"ined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at"
17282,"his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole,"
17283,and Voldemort’s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.
17284,With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort’s mind
17285,"again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Require-"
17286,"ment, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up."
17287,"“Are you all right, Harry?” Neville was saying. “Want to sit down?"
17288,"I expect you’re tired, aren’t — ?”"
17289,"“No,” said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell"
17290,them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of
17291,one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Volde-
17292,"mort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance."
17293,"“We need to get going,” he said, and their expressions told him"
17294,that they understood.
17295,"“What are we going to do, then, Harry?” asked Seamus. “What’s"
17296,the plan?”
17297,“Plan?” repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to
17298,prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort’s rage: His scar was
17299,"still burning. “Well, there’s something we — Ron, Hermione, and"
17300,"I — need to do, and then we’ll get out of here.”"
17301,Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked
17302,confused.
17303,"“What d’you mean, ‘get out of here’?”"
17304, 579   
17305,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17306,"“We haven’t come back to stay,” said Harry, rubbing his scar,"
17307,trying to soothe the pain. “There’s something important we need
17308,to do —”
17309,“What is it?”
17310,“I — I can’t tell you.”
17311,There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville’s brows
17312,contracted.
17313,“Why can’t you tell us? It’s something to do with fighting You-
17314,"Know-Who, right?”"
17315,"“Well, yeah —”"
17316,“Then we’ll help you.”
17317,"The other members of Dumbledore’s Army were nodding, some"
17318,"enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their"
17319,chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.
17320,“You don’t understand.” Harry seemed to have said that a lot
17321,in the last few hours. “We — we can’t tell you. We’ve got to do
17322,it — alone.”
17323,“Why?” asked Neville.
17324,“Because . . .” In his desperation to start looking for the miss-
17325,"ing Horcrux, or at least to have a private discussion with Ron and"
17326,"Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry"
17327,found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing.
17328,"“Dumbledore left the three of us a job,” he said carefully, “and"
17329,"we weren’t supposed to tell — I mean, he wanted us to do it, just"
17330,the three of us.”
17331,"“We’re his army,” said Neville. “Dumbledore’s Army. We were all"
17332,"in it together, we’ve been keeping it going while you three have been"
17333,off on your own —”
17334, 580   
17335,THE LOST DIADEM
17336,"“It hasn’t exactly been a picnic, mate,” said Ron."
17337,"“I never said it had, but I don’t see why you can’t trust us. Every-"
17338,one in this room’s been fighting and they’ve been driven in here
17339,because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here’s
17340,proven they’re loyal to Dumbledore — loyal to you.”
17341,"“Look,” Harry began, without knowing what he was going to"
17342,"say, but it did not matter: The tunnel door had just opened behind"
17343,him.
17344,"“We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you"
17345,must be here!”
17346,It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and
17347,ran to hug his best friend.
17348,"“Hi, everyone!” said Luna happily. “Oh, it’s great to be back!”"
17349,"“Luna,” said Harry distractedly, “what are you doing here? How"
17350,did you — ?”
17351,"“I sent for her,” said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. “I"
17352,promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I’d let them know.
17353,"We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution."
17354,That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.”
17355,"“Of course that’s what it means,” said Luna brightly. “Isn’t it,"
17356,Harry? We’re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?”
17357,"“Listen,” said Harry with a rising sense of panic, “I’m sorry, but"
17358,that’s not what we came back for. There’s something we’ve got to
17359,"do, and then —”"
17360,“You’re going to leave us in this mess?” demanded Michael
17361,Corner.
17362,“No!” said Ron. “What we’re doing will benefit everyone in the
17363,"end, it’s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who —”"
17364, 581   
17365,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17366,“Then let us help!” said Neville angrily. “We want to be a part
17367,of it!”
17368,"There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His"
17369,heart seemed to fail: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in
17370,"the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny"
17371,"gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, or had never fully ap-"
17372,"preciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased"
17373,to see her.
17374,"“Aberforth’s getting a bit annoyed,” said Fred, raising his hand"
17375,"in answer to several cries of greeting. “He wants a kip, and his bar’s"
17376,turned into a railway station.”
17377,Harry’s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry’s
17378,"old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him."
17379,"“I got the message,” she said, holding up her own fake Galleon,"
17380,and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.
17381,"“So what’s the plan, Harry?” said George."
17382,"“There isn’t one,” said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden ap-"
17383,"pearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his"
17384,scar was still burning so fiercely.
17385,"“Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite"
17386,"kind,” said Fred."
17387,“You’ve got to stop this!” Harry told Neville. “What did you call
17388,them all back for? This is insane —”
17389,"“We’re fighting, aren’t we?” said Dean, taking out his fake Gal-"
17390,"leon. “The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight!"
17391,"I’ll have to get a wand, though —”"
17392,“You haven’t got a wand — ?” began Seamus.
17393,Ron turned suddenly to Harry.
17394, 582   
17395,THE LOST DIADEM
17396,“Why can’t they help?”
17397,“What?”
17398,"“They can help.” He dropped his voice and said, so that none"
17399,"of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between them, “We"
17400,don’t know where it is. We’ve got to find it fast. We don’t have to
17401,tell them it’s a Horcrux.”
17402,"Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, “I think"
17403,"Ron’s right. We don’t even know what we’re looking for, we need"
17404,"them.” And when Harry looked unconvinced, “You don’t have to"
17405,"do everything alone, Harry.”"
17406,"Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening"
17407,to split again. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone
17408,"but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that’s"
17409,"how we grew up, and Albus . . . he was a natural. . . . Was he turning"
17410,"into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid"
17411,"to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that"
17412,led? To murder at the top of the highest tower . . .
17413,"“All right,” he said quietly to the other two. “Okay,” he called to"
17414,"the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had"
17415,"been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and"
17416,"all of them looked alert, excited."
17417,"“There’s something we need to find,” Harry said. “Some-"
17418,thing — something that’ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It’s
17419,"here at Hogwarts, but we don’t know where. It might have be-"
17420,longed to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that?
17421,"Has anyone ever come across something with her eagle on it, for"
17422,instance?”
17423,"He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to"
17424, 583  
17425,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17426,"Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered,"
17427,perched on the arm of Ginny’s chair.
17428,"“Well, there’s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember,"
17429,Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy’s trying to dupli-
17430,cate it.”
17431,"“Yeah, but the lost diadem,” said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes,"
17432,"“is lost, Luna. That’s sort of the point.”"
17433,“When was it lost?” asked Harry.
17434,"“Centuries ago, they say,” said Cho, and Harry’s heart sank. “Pro-"
17435,fessor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself.
17436,"People have looked, but,” she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws,"
17437,"“nobody’s ever found a trace of it, have they?”"
17438,They all shook their heads.
17439,"“Sorry, but what is a diadem?” asked Ron."
17440,"“It’s a kind of crown,” said Terry Boot. “Ravenclaw’s was supposed"
17441,"to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.”"
17442,"“Yes, Daddy’s Wrackspurt siphons —”"
17443,But Harry cut across Luna.
17444,“And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?”
17445,They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Her-
17446,mione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An
17447,"object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace,"
17448,did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the
17449,"castle. . . . Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho"
17450,spoke again.
17451,"“If you’d like to see what the diadem’s supposed to look like, I"
17452,"could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry?"
17453,Ravenclaw’s wearing it in her statue.”
17454,Harry’s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Require-
17455, 584  
17456,THE LOST DIADEM
17457,"ment swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring"
17458,beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders.
17459,"Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or"
17460,"here, to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was hardly"
17461,any time left.
17462,"“He’s on the move,” he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He"
17463,"glanced at Cho and then back at them. “Listen, I know it’s not much"
17464,"of a lead, but I’m going to go and look at this statue, at least find"
17465,"out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you"
17466,know — the other one — safe.”
17467,"Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, “No, Luna"
17468,"will take Harry, won’t you, Luna?”"
17469,"“Oooh, yes, I’d like to,” said Luna happily, and Cho sat down"
17470,"again, looking disappointed."
17471,“How do we get out?” Harry asked Neville.
17472,“Over here.”
17473,"He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard"
17474,opened onto a steep staircase.
17475,"“It comes out somewhere different every day, so they’ve never"
17476,"been able to find it,” he said. “Only trouble is, we never know exactly"
17477,"where we’re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry,"
17478,they’re always patrolling the corridors at night.”
17479,"“No problem,” said Harry. “See you in a bit.”"
17480,"He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by"
17481,"torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they"
17482,reached what appeared to be solid wall.
17483,"“Get under here,” Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility"
17484,Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little
17485,push.
17486, 585  
17487,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17488,It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside: Harry glanced
17489,back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were stand-
17490,"ing in a dark corridor: Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows,"
17491,"fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder’s"
17492,"Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and"
17493,Luna’s dots at last.
17494,"“We’re up on the fifth floor,” he whispered, watching Filch mov-"
17495,"ing away from them, a corridor ahead. “Come on, this way.”"
17496,They crept off.
17497,"Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but"
17498,"never had his heart hammered this fast, never had so much de-"
17499,pended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares
17500,"of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets"
17501,"creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond"
17502,"which who knew what lurked, Harry and Luna walked, checking"
17503,"the Marauder’s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to"
17504,allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He
17505,expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear
17506,"was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first,"
17507,telltale signs of the poltergeist’s approach.
17508,"“This way, Harry,” breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling"
17509,him toward a spiral staircase.
17510,"They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up"
17511,here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and
17512,"no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze"
17513,knocker in the shape of an eagle.
17514,"Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in"
17515,"midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the"
17516,silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of
17517,  586  
17518,THE LOST DIADEM
17519,"the eagle opened, but instead of a bird’s call, a soft, musical voice"
17520,"said, “Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?”"
17521,"“Hmm . . . What do you think, Harry?” said Luna, looking"
17522,thoughtful.
17523,“What? Isn’t there just a password?”
17524,"“Oh no, you’ve got to answer a question,” said Luna."
17525,“What if you get it wrong?”
17526,"“Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,” said"
17527,"Luna. “That way you learn, you see?”"
17528,"“Yeah . . . Trouble is, we can’t really afford to wait for anyone"
17529,"else, Luna.”"
17530,"“No, I see what you mean,” said Luna seriously. “Well then, I"
17531,think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.”
17532,"“Well reasoned,” said the voice, and the door swung open."
17533,"The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular"
17534,"room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful"
17535,"arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-"
17536,"and-bronze silks: By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular"
17537,view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and
17538,"painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet."
17539,"There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite"
17540,the door stood a tall statue of white marble.
17541,Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen
17542,"at Luna’s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed,"
17543,"to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and"
17544,she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her
17545,"face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet"
17546,had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not un-
17547,like the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words
17548, 587   
17549,CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE
17550,etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed
17551,up onto Ravenclaw’s plinth to read them.
17552,“ ‘Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.’ ”
17553,"“Which makes you pretty skint, witless,” said a cackling voice."
17554,"Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the"
17555,floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing
17556,"before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby"
17557,forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.
17558, 588   
17559,CHAPTER THIRTY

17561,SEVERUS SNAPE
17562,"T      he moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry’s scar"
17563,"burned savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and"
17564,"he was standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, and the sea"
17565,was washing around him and there was triumph in his heart — They
17566,have the boy.
17567,"A loud bang brought Harry back to where he stood: Disoriented,"
17568,"he raised his wand, but the witch before him was already falling"
17569,forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases
17570,tinkled.
17571,"“I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,” said"
17572,"Luna, sounding mildly interested. “That was noisier than I thought"
17573,it would be.”
17574,"And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying,"
17575,echoing footsteps were growing louder from behind the door lead-
17576,ing to the dormitories: Luna’s spell had woken Ravenclaws sleeping
17577,above.
17578,  589   
17579,CHAPTER THIRTY
17580,"“Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!”"
17581,Luna’s feet appeared out of nowhere; he hurried to her side and
17582,she let the Cloak fall back over them as the door opened and a
17583,"stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the"
17584,common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw
17585,"Alecto lying there unconscious. Slowly they shuffled in around her,"
17586,a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack them.
17587,Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her
17588,backside with his big toe.
17589,“I think she might be dead!” he shouted with delight.
17590,"“Oh, look,” whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded"
17591,in around Alecto. “They’re pleased!”
17592,“Yeah . . . great . . .”
17593,"Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink"
17594,again into Voldemort’s mind. . . . He was moving along the tunnel
17595,into the first cave. . . . He had chosen to make sure of the locket
17596,before coming . . . but that would not take him long. . . .
17597,There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw
17598,"froze. From the other side, Harry heard the soft, musical voice that"
17599,issued from the eagle door knocker: “Where do Vanished objects
17600,go?”
17601,"“I dunno, do I? Shut it!” snarled an uncouth voice that Harry"
17602,"knew was that of the Carrow brother, Amycus. “Alecto? Alecto? Are"
17603,you there? Have you got him? Open the door!”
17604,"The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified."
17605,"Then, without warning, there came a series of loud bangs, as though"
17606,somebody was firing a gun into the door.
17607,"“ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven’t got Potter — d’you"
17608,want to go the same way as the Malfoys? ANSWER ME!” Amycus
17609, 590 
17610,THE SACKING OF
17611,SEVERUS SNAPE
17612,"bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did not"
17613,"open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most"
17614,frightened began scampering back up the staircase to their beds.
17615,"Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he ought not to blast"
17616,open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do
17617,"anything else, a second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the"
17618,door.
17619,"“May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?”"
17620,“Trying — to get — through this damned — door!” shouted
17621,"Amycus. “Go and get Flitwick! Get him to open it, now!”"
17622,“But isn’t your sister in there?” asked Professor McGonagall.
17623,"“Didn’t Professor Flitwick let her in earlier this evening, at your"
17624,urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you
17625,needn’t wake up half the castle.”
17626,"“She ain’t answering, you old besom! You open it! Garn! Do it,"
17627,now!
17628,"“Certainly, if you wish it,” said Professor McGonagall, with aw-"
17629,ful coldness. There was a genteel tap of the knocker and the musical
17630,"voice asked again,"
17631,“Where do Vanished objects go?”
17632,"“Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,” replied Professor"
17633,McGonagall.
17634,"“Nicely phrased,” replied the eagle door knocker, and the door"
17635,swung open.
17636,The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the
17637,"stairs as Amycus burst over the threshold, brandishing his wand."
17638,"Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny eyes,"
17639,"which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He"
17640,let out a yell of fury and fear.

17643,"“What’ve they done, the little whelps?” he screamed. “I’ll Cruci-"
17644,ate the lot of ’em till they tell me who did it — and what’s the Dark
17645,"Lord going to say?” he shrieked, standing over his sister and smack-"
17646,"ing himself on the forehead with his fist. “We haven’t got him, and"
17647,they’ve gorn and killed her!”
17648,"“She’s only Stunned,” said Professor McGonagall impatiently,"
17649,who had stooped down to examine Alecto. “She’ll be perfectly all
17650,right.”
17651,“No she bludgering well won’t!” bellowed Amycus. “Not after
17652,"the Dark Lord gets hold of her! She’s gorn and sent for him, I felt"
17653,"me Mark burn, and he thinks we’ve got Potter!”"
17654,“ ‘Got Potter’?” said Professor McGonagall sharply. “What do
17655,"you mean, ‘got Potter’?”"
17656,"“He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower,"
17657,and to send for him if we caught him!”
17658,“Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower?
17659,Potter belongs in my House!”
17660,"Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of"
17661,"pride in her voice, and affection for Minerva McGonagall gushed"
17662,up inside him.
17663,“We was told he might come in here!” said Carrow. “I dunno
17664,"why, do I?”"
17665,Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the
17666,room. Twice they passed right over the place where Harry and Luna
17667,stood.
17668,"“We can push it off on the kids,” said Amycus, his piglike face"
17669,"suddenly crafty. “Yeah, that’s what we’ll do. We’ll say Alecto was"
17670,"ambushed by the kids, them kids up there” — he looked up at the"
17671,starry ceiling toward the dormitories — “and we’ll say they forced
17672, 592 

17675,"her to press her Mark, and that’s why he got a false alarm. . . . He can"
17676,"punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what’s the difference?”"
17677,"“Only the difference between truth and lies, courage and coward-"
17678,"ice,” said Professor McGonagall, who had turned pale, “a difference,"
17679,"in short, which you and your sister seem unable to appreciate. But let"
17680,me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many
17681,ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.”
17682,“Excuse me?”
17683,Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Profes-
17684,"sor McGonagall, his face within inches of hers. She refused to back"
17685,"away, but looked down at him as if he were something disgusting"
17686,she had found stuck to a lavatory seat.
17687,"“It’s not a case of what you’ll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your"
17688,"time’s over. It’s us what’s in charge here now, and you’ll back me up"
17689,or you’ll pay the price.”
17690,And he spat in her face.
17691,"Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said,"
17692,“You shouldn’t have done that.”
17693,"As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, “Crucio!”"
17694,The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the
17695,"air like a drowning man, thrashing and howling in pain, and then,"
17696,"with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into the front"
17697,"of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor."
17698,"“I see what Bellatrix meant,” said Harry, the blood thundering"
17699,"through his brain, “you need to really mean it.”"
17700,"“Potter!” whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart."
17701,“Potter — you’re here! What — ? How — ?” She struggled to pull
17702,"herself together. “Potter, that was foolish!”"
17703,"“He spat at you,” said Harry."
17704, 593  
17705,CHAPTER THIRTY
17706,"“Potter, I — that was very — very gallant of you — but don’t"
17707,you realize — ?”
17708,"“Yeah, I do,” Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied"
17709,"him. “Professor McGonagall, Voldemort’s on the way.”"
17710,"“Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?” asked Luna with an"
17711,"air of interest, pulling off the Invisibility Cloak. This appearance of"
17712,"a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor McGonagall, who"
17713,"staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the"
17714,neck of her old tartan dressing gown.
17715,"“I don’t think it makes any difference what we call him,” Harry"
17716,told Luna. “He already knows where I am.”
17717,"In a distant part of Harry’s brain, that part connected to the an-"
17718,"gry, burning scar, he could see Voldemort sailing fast over the dark"
17719,lake in the ghostly green boat. . . . He had nearly reached the island
17720,where the stone basin stood. . . .
17721,"“You must flee,” whispered Professor McGonagall. “Now, Potter,"
17722,as quickly as you can!”
17723,"“I can’t,” said Harry. “There’s something I need to do. Professor,"
17724,do you know where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”
17725,“The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not — hasn’t it been lost
17726,"for centuries?” She sat up a little straighter. “Potter, it was madness,"
17727,"utter madness, for you to enter this castle —”"
17728,"“I had to,” said Harry. “Professor, there’s something hidden here"
17729,"that I’m supposed to find, and it could be the diadem — if I could"
17730,just speak to Professor Flitwick —”
17731,"There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass: Amycus was"
17732,"coming round. Before Harry or Luna could act, Professor McGona-"
17733,"gall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death Eater,"
17734,"and said, “Imperio.”"
17735, 594    
17736,THE SACKING OF

17738,"Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand,"
17739,then shuffled obediently to Professor McGonagall and handed it over
17740,along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor beside Alecto.
17741,"Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shim-"
17742,mering silver rope appeared out of thin air and snaked around the
17743,"Carrows, binding them tightly together."
17744,"“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him"
17745,"again with superb indifference to the Carrows’ predicament, “if"
17746,He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are
17747,here —”
17748,"As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through"
17749,"Harry, setting his scar on fire, and for a second he looked down"
17750,"upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no golden"
17751,locket lay safe beneath the surface —
17752,"“Potter, are you all right?” said a voice, and Harry came back: He"
17753,was clutching Luna’s shoulder to steady himself.
17754,"“Time’s running out, Voldemort’s getting nearer. Professor, I’m"
17755,"acting on Dumbledore’s orders, I must find what he wanted me to"
17756,find! But we’ve got to get the students out while I’m searching the
17757,"castle — it’s me Voldemort wants, but he won’t care about killing a"
17758,"few more or less, not now —” not now he knows I’m attacking Hor-"
17759,"cruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head."
17760,“You’re acting on Dumbledore’s orders?” she repeated with a look of
17761,dawning wonder. Then she drew herself up to her fullest height.
17762,“We shall secure the school against He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
17763,Named while you search for this — this object.”
17764,“Is that possible?”
17765,"“I think so,” said Professor McGonagall dryly, “we teachers are"
17766,"rather good at magic, you know. I am sure we will be able to hold"
17767, 595   
17768,CHAPTER THIRTY
17769,"him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of course,"
17770,something will have to be done about Professor Snape —”
17771,“Let me —”
17772,"“— and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the"
17773,"Dark Lord at the gates, it would indeed be advisable to take as"
17774,many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo
17775,"Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the"
17776,grounds —”
17777,"“There’s a way,” said Harry quickly, and he explained about the"
17778,passageway leading into the Hog’s Head.
17779,"“Potter, we’re talking about hundreds of students —”"
17780,"“I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are"
17781,concentrating on the school boundaries they won’t be interested in
17782,anyone who’s Disapparating out of the Hog’s Head.”
17783,"“There’s something in that,” she agreed. She pointed her wand at"
17784,"the Carrows, and a silver net fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself"
17785,"around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they dangled"
17786,"beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures."
17787,“Come. We must alert the other Heads of House. You’d better put
17788,that Cloak back on.”
17789,"She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her"
17790,wand. From the tip burst three silver cats with spectacle markings
17791,"around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the spi-"
17792,"ral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and"
17793,Luna hurried back down.
17794,"Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left"
17795,them; Professor McGonagall’s tartan dressing gown rustled over the
17796,"floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her under the Cloak."
17797, 596  
17798,THE SACKING OF
17799,SEVERUS SNAPE
17800,They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet
17801,"footsteps joined theirs. Harry, whose scar was still prickling, heard"
17802,them first: He felt in the pouch around his neck for the Marauder’s
17803,"Map, but before he could take it out, McGonagall too seemed to"
17804,"become aware of their company. She halted, raised her wand ready"
17805,"to duel, and said, “Who’s there?”"
17806,"“It is I,” said a low voice."
17807,From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape.
17808,Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him: He had forgotten
17809,"the details of Snape’s appearance in the magnitude of his crimes,"
17810,forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains around his thin
17811,"face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing"
17812,"nightclothes, but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too"
17813,was holding his wand ready for a fight.
17814,“Where are the Carrows?” he asked quietly.
17815,"“Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,” said Profes-"
17816,sor McGonagall.
17817,"Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGona-"
17818,"gall into the air around her, as if he knew that Harry was there."
17819,"Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack."
17820,"“I was under the impression,” said Snape, “that Alecto had ap-"
17821,prehended an intruder.”
17822,“Really?” said Professor McGonagall. “And what gave you that
17823,impression?”
17824,"Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the"
17825,Dark Mark was branded into his skin.
17826,"“Oh, but naturally,” said Professor McGonagall. “You Death Eat-"
17827,"ers have your own private means of communication, I forgot.”"
17828, 597 
17829,CHAPTER THIRTY
17830,Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still prob-
17831,"ing the air all about her, and he was moving gradually closer, with"
17832,an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.
17833,"“I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors,"
17834,Minerva.”
17835,“You have some objection?”
17836,“I wonder what could have brought you out of your bed at this
17837,late hour?”
17838,"“I thought I heard a disturbance,” said Professor McGonagall."
17839,“Really? But all seems calm.”
17840,Snape looked into her eyes.
17841,"“Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have, I"
17842,must insist —”
17843,Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have be-
17844,lieved: Her wand slashed through the air and for a split second Harry
17845,"thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the swiftness of"
17846,his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off bal-
17847,ance. She brandished her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out
17848,"of its bracket: Harry, about to curse Snape, was forced to pull Luna"
17849,"out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire"
17850,that filled the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape —
17851,"Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGona-"
17852,"gall blasted to smoke, which re-formed and solidified in seconds to"
17853,become a swarm of pursuing daggers: Snape avoided them only by
17854,"forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs"
17855,"the daggers sank, one after another, into its breast —"
17856,"“Minerva!” said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still"
17857,"shielding Luna from flying spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick"
17858,and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their night-
17859, 598   
17860,THE SACKING OF
17861,SEVERUS SNAPE
17862,"clothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the"
17863,rear.
17864,"“No!” squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. “You’ll do no more"
17865,murder at Hogwarts!”
17866,Flitwick’s spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had
17867,taken shelter: With a clatter it came to life. Snape struggled free
17868,of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers:
17869,Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into
17870,"the wall and shattered. When Harry looked up again, Snape was in"
17871,"full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering after"
17872,"him: He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he"
17873,"heard McGonagall cry, “Coward! COWARD!”"
17874,"“What’s happened, what’s happened?” asked Luna."
17875,Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corri-
17876,"dor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak behind them, into the deserted"
17877,"classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were"
17878,standing at a smashed window.
17879,"“He jumped,” said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran"
17880,into the room.
17881,"“You mean he’s dead?” Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring"
17882,Flitwick’s and Sprout’s yells of shock at his sudden appearance.
17883,"“No, he’s not dead,” said McGonagall bitterly. “Unlike Dumble-"
17884,"dore, he was still carrying a wand . . . and he seems to have learned"
17885,a few tricks from his master.”
17886,"With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, batlike"
17887,shape flying through the darkness toward the perimeter wall.
17888,"There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puff-"
17889,ing: Slughorn had just caught up.
17890,"“Harry!” he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his"
17891, 599   
17892,CHAPTER THIRTY
17893,emerald-green silk pajamas. “My dear boy . . . what a surprise . . .
17894,"Minerva, do please explain. . . . Severus . . . what . . . ?”"
17895,"“Our headmaster is taking a short break,” said Professor McGona-"
17896,"gall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window."
17897,"“Professor!” Harry shouted, his hands at his forehead. He could"
17898,"see the Inferi-filled lake sliding beneath him, and he felt the ghostly"
17899,"green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort leapt"
17900,from it with murder in his heart —
17901,"“Professor, we’ve got to barricade the school, he’s coming now!”"
17902,"“Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,” she told"
17903,the other teachers. Sprout and Flitwick gasped; Slughorn let out a
17904,low groan. “Potter has work to do in the castle on Dumbledore’s
17905,orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are
17906,capable while Potter does what he needs to do.”
17907,"“You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep"
17908,out You-Know-Who indefinitely?” squeaked Flitwick.
17909,"“But we can hold him up,” said Professor Sprout."
17910,"“Thank you, Pomona,” said Professor McGonagall, and between"
17911,the two witches there passed a look of grim understanding. “I sug-
17912,"gest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather"
17913,"our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated,"
17914,"though if any of those who are over age wish to stay and fight, I"
17915,think they ought to be given the chance.”
17916,"“Agreed,” said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the"
17917,door. “I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with
17918,my House.”
17919,"And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering,"
17920,"“Tentacula. Devil’s Snare. And Snargaluff pods . . . yes, I’d like to"
17921,see the Death Eaters fighting those.”
17922, 600  

17925,"“I can act from here,” said Flitwick, and although he could barely"
17926,"see out of it, he pointed his wand through the smashed window and"
17927,started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry heard a
17928,"weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power"
17929,of the wind into the grounds.
17930,"“Professor,” Harry said, approaching the little Charms master,"
17931,"“Professor, I’m sorry to interrupt, but this is important. Have you"
17932,got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?”
17933,“— Protego Horribilis — the diadem of Ravenclaw?” squeaked
17934,"Flitwick. “A little extra wisdom never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly"
17935,think it would be much use in this situation!”
17936,“I only meant — do you know where it is? Have you ever
17937,seen it?”
17938,"“Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost,"
17939,boy!”
17940,Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic.
17941,"What, then, was the Horcrux?"
17942,"“We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall,"
17943,"Filius!” said Professor McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna"
17944,to follow her.
17945,They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into
17946,speech.
17947,"“My word,” he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache"
17948,"aquiver. “What a to-do! I’m not at all sure whether this is wise,"
17949,"Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you know, and anyone who"
17950,has tried to delay him will be in most grievous peril —”
17951,“I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty
17952,"minutes, also,” said Professor McGonagall. “If you wish to leave"
17953,"with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you attempt"
17954, 601  
17955,CHAPTER THIRTY
17956,to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this
17957,"castle, then, Horace, we duel to kill.”"
17958,"“Minerva!” he said, aghast."
17959,“The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyal-
17960,"ties,” interrupted Professor McGonagall. “Go and wake your stu-"
17961,"dents, Horace.”"
17962,Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter: He and Luna ran
17963,"after Professor McGonagall, who had taken up a position in the"
17964,middle of the corridor and raised her wand.
17965,"“Piertotum — oh, for heaven’s sake, Filch, not now —”"
17966,"The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting,"
17967,“Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!”
17968,"“They’re supposed to be, you blithering idiot!” shouted McGona-"
17969,gall. “Now go and do something constructive! Find Peeves!”
17970,“P-Peeves?” stammered Filch as though he had never heard the
17971,name before.
17972,"“Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven’t you been complaining"
17973,"about him for a quarter of a century? Go and fetch him, at once!”"
17974,Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of
17975,"her senses, but hobbled away, hunch-shouldered, muttering under"
17976,his breath.
17977,“And now — Piertotum Locomotor!” cried Professor McGonagall.
17978,And all along the corridor the statues and suits of armor jumped
17979,"down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the"
17980,"floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout"
17981,the castle had done the same.
17982,“Hogwarts is threatened!” shouted Professor McGonagall. “Man
17983,"the boundaries, protect us, do your duty to our school!”"
17984,"Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded"
17985, 602   
17986,THE SACKING OF

17988,"past Harry: some of them smaller, others larger, than life. There were"
17989,"animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished swords and"
17990,spiked balls on chains.
17991,"“Now, Potter,” said McGonagall, “you and Miss Lovegood had"
17992,better return to your friends and bring them to the Great Hall — I
17993,shall rouse the other Gryffindors.”
17994,"They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna"
17995,running back toward the concealed entrance to the Room of Re-
17996,"quirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing"
17997,"traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the"
17998,Great Hall by teachers and prefects.
17999,“That was Potter!”
18000,“Harry Potter!”
18001,"“It was him, I swear, I just saw him!”"
18002,"But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance"
18003,to the Room of Requirement. Harry leaned against the enchanted
18004,"wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back"
18005,down the steep staircase.
18006,“Wh — ?”
18007,"As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in"
18008,"shock. It was packed, far more crowded than when he had last been"
18009,"in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were Oliver"
18010,"Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and"
18011,"Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley."
18012,"“Harry, what’s happening?” said Lupin, meeting him at the foot"
18013,of the stairs.
18014,"“Voldemort’s on his way, they’re barricading the school — Snape’s"
18015,run for it — What are you doing here? How did you know?”
18016,"“We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore’s Army,” Fred"
18017, 603  
18018,CHAPTER THIRTY
18019,"explained. “You couldn’t expect everyone to miss the fun, Harry,"
18020,"and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of"
18021,snowballed.”
18022,"“What first, Harry?” called George. “What’s going on?”"
18023,“They’re evacuating the younger kids and everyone’s meeting in
18024,"the Great Hall to get organized,” Harry said. “We’re fighting.”"
18025,There was a great roar and a surge toward the foot of the stairs; he
18026,"was pressed back against the wall as they ran past him, the mingled"
18027,"members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore’s Army, and"
18028,"Harry’s old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading"
18029,up into the main castle.
18030,"“Come on, Luna,” Dean called as he passed, holding out his free"
18031,hand; she took it and followed him back up the stairs.
18032,The crowd was thinning: Only a little knot of people remained
18033,"below in the Room of Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs."
18034,"Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them stood Lupin,"
18035,"Fred, George, Bill, and Fleur."
18036,“You’re underage!” Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry
18037,"approached. “I won’t permit it! The boys, yes, but you, you’ve got"
18038,to go home!”
18039,“I won’t!”
18040,Ginny’s hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother’s grip.
18041,“I’m in Dumbledore’s Army —”
18042,“A teenagers’ gang!”
18043,"“A teenagers’ gang that’s about to take him on, which no one else"
18044,has dared to do!” said Fred.
18045,“She’s sixteen!” shouted Mrs. Weasley. “She’s not old enough!
18046,"What you two were thinking, bringing her with you —”"
18047,Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves.

18051,"“Mum’s right, Ginny,” said Bill gently. “You can’t do this. Every-"
18052,"one underage will have to leave, it’s only right.”"
18053,"“I can’t go home!” Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her"
18054,"eyes. “My whole family’s here, I can’t stand waiting there alone and"
18055,not knowing and —”
18056,Her eyes met Harry’s for the first time. She looked at him be-
18057,"seechingly, but he shook his head and she turned away bitterly."
18058,"“Fine,” she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the"
18059,"Hog’s Head. “I’ll say good-bye now, then, and —”"
18060,There was a scuffling and a great thump: Someone else had clam-
18061,"bered out of the tunnel, overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled"
18062,"himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through lopsided"
18063,"horn-rimmed glasses, and said, “Am I too late? Has it started? I only"
18064,"just found out, so I — I —”"
18065,Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run
18066,"into most of his family. There was a long moment of astonishment,"
18067,"broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a wildly transparent"
18068,"attempt to break the tension, “So — ’ow eez leetle Teddy?”"
18069,"Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys"
18070,"seemed to be solidifying, like ice."
18071,"“I — oh yes — he’s fine!” Lupin said loudly. “Yes, Tonks is with"
18072,him — at her mother’s —”
18073,"Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another,"
18074,frozen.
18075,"“Here, I’ve got a picture!” Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph"
18076,"from inside his jacket and showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw"
18077,"a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat fists at"
18078,the camera.
18079,"“I was a fool!” Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped"
18080, 605  
18081,CHAPTER THIRTY
18082,"his photograph. “I was an idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was"
18083,a — a —”
18084,"“Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,” said"
18085,Fred.
18086,Percy swallowed.
18087,"“Yes, I was!”"
18088,"“Well, you can’t say fairer than that,” said Fred, holding out his"
18089,hand to Percy.
18090,"Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred"
18091,"aside, and pulled Percy into a strangling hug, while he patted her on"
18092,"the back, his eyes on his father."
18093,"“I’m sorry, Dad,” Percy said."
18094,"Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug"
18095,his son.
18096,"“What made you see sense, Perce?” inquired George."
18097,"“It’s been coming on for a while,” said Percy, mopping his eyes"
18098,under his glasses with a corner of his traveling cloak. “But I had to
18099,"find a way out and it’s not so easy at the Ministry, they’re imprison-"
18100,ing traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth
18101,and he tipped me off ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to
18102,"make a fight of it, so here I am.”"
18103,"“Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as"
18104,"these,” said George in a good imitation of Percy’s most pompous"
18105,"manner. “Now let’s get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death"
18106,Eaters’ll be taken.”
18107,"“So, you’re my sister-in-law now?” said Percy, shaking hands with"
18108,"Fleur as they hurried off toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and"
18109,George.
18110,“Ginny!” barked Mrs. Weasley.
18111,  606  
18112,THE SACKING OF

18114,"Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliation,"
18115,to sneak upstairs too.
18116,"“Molly, how about this,” said Lupin. “Why doesn’t Ginny stay"
18117,"here, then at least she’ll be on the scene and know what’s going on,"
18118,but she won’t be in the middle of the fighting?”
18119,“I —”
18120,"“That’s a good idea,” said Mr. Weasley firmly. “Ginny, you stay"
18121,"in this room, you hear me?”"
18122,"Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father’s"
18123,"unusually stern gaze, she nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin"
18124,headed off for the stairs as well.
18125,“Where’s Ron?” asked Harry. “Where’s Hermione?”
18126,"“They must have gone up to the Great Hall already,” Mr. Weasley"
18127,called over his shoulder.
18128,"“I didn’t see them pass me,” said Harry."
18129,"“They said something about a bathroom,” said Ginny, “not long"
18130,after you left.”
18131,“A bathroom?”
18132,Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the
18133,Room of Requirement and checked the bathroom beyond. It was
18134,empty.
18135,“You’re sure they said bath — ?”
18136,But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished:
18137,He was looking through the high wrought-iron gates with winged
18138,"boars on pillars at either side, looking through the dark grounds"
18139,"toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped"
18140,"over his shoulders. He was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of"
18141,purpose that preceded murder.

18147,"tered with stars, and below it the four long House tables"
18148,"were lined with disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others"
18149,in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of
18150,"the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead, was fixed upon Profes-"
18151,"sor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the"
18152,"top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teachers, including"
18153,"the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the"
18154,Phoenix who had arrived to fight.

18156,"frey. Prefects, when I give the word, you will organize your House and"
18157,"take your charges, in an orderly fashion, to the evacuation point.”"
18158,"Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted"
18159,"the walls, scanning the Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione,"
18160,"Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and shouted, “And"
18161,what if we want to stay and fight?”
18162, 608   
18163,THE BATTLE OF
18164,HOGWARTS
18165,There was a smattering of applause.
18166,"“If you are of age, you may stay,” said Professor McGonagall."
18167,“What about our things?” called a girl at the Ravenclaw table.
18168,"“Our trunks, our owls?”"
18169,"“We have no time to collect possessions,” said Professor McGona-"
18170,gall. “The important thing is to get you out of here safely.”
18171,“Where’s Professor Snape?” shouted a girl from the Slytherin
18172,table.
18173,"“He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk,” replied Pro-"
18174,"fessor McGonagall, and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors,"
18175,"Hufflepuffs, and Ravenclaws."
18176,"Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still"
18177,"looking for Ron and Hermione. As he passed, faces turned in his"
18178,"direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake."
18179,"“We have already placed protection around the castle,” Professor"
18180,"McGonagall was saying, “but it is unlikely to hold for very long un-"
18181,"less we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move quickly and"
18182,"calmly, and do as your prefects —”"
18183,But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed
18184,"throughout the Hall. It was high, cold, and clear: There was no"
18185,telling from where it came; it seemed to issue from the walls them-
18186,"selves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain"
18187,dormant there for centuries.
18188,“I know that you are preparing to fight.” There were screams
18189,"amongst the students, some of whom clutched each other, look-"
18190,ing around in terror for the source of the sound. “Your efforts are
18191,futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great
18192,respect for the teachers of Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical
18193,blood.”
18194, 609   
18195,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18196,"There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses"
18197,"against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by"
18198,walls.
18199,"“Give me Harry Potter,” said Voldemort’s voice, “and none shall"
18200,"be harmed. Give me Harry Potter, and I shall leave the school un-"
18201,"touched. Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded."
18202,“You have until midnight.”
18203,"The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every"
18204,"eye in the place seemed to have found Harry, to hold him frozen"
18205,in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose
18206,from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she
18207,"raised a shaking arm and screamed, “But he’s there! Potter’s there!"
18208,Someone grab him!”
18209,"Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The"
18210,"Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry,"
18211,"but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the"
18212,"same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to"
18213,"Harry, all of them looking toward Pansy instead, and Harry, awe-"
18214,"struck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled"
18215,from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves.
18216,"“Thank you, Miss Parkinson,” said Professor McGonagall in a"
18217,clipped voice. “You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the
18218,rest of your House could follow.”
18219,Harry heard the grinding of benches and then the sound of the
18220,Slytherins trooping out on the other side of the Hall.
18221,"“Ravenclaws, follow on!” cried Professor McGonagall."
18222,Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was com-
18223,"pletely deserted, but a number of older Ravenclaws remained seated"
18224,"while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed behind,"
18225, 610 
18226,THE BATTLE OF
18227,HOGWARTS
18228,"and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Profes-"
18229,sor McGonagall’s descent from the teachers’ platform to chivvy the
18230,underage on their way.
18231,"“Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!”"
18232,"Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the"
18233,Gryffindor table.
18234,“Where are Ron and Hermione?”
18235,"“Haven’t you found — ?” began Mr. Weasley, looking worried."
18236,But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised
18237,platform to address those who had remained behind.
18238,"“We’ve only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act"
18239,fast! A battle plan has been agreed between the teachers of Hog-
18240,"warts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout,"
18241,and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three
18242,"highest towers — Ravenclaw, Astronomy, and Gryffindor — where"
18243,"they’ll have a good overview, excellent positions from which to work"
18244,spells. Meanwhile Remus” — he indicated Lupin — “Arthur” — he
18245,"pointed toward Mr. Weasley, sitting at the Gryffindor table — “and"
18246,I will take groups into the grounds. We’ll need somebody to organize
18247,defense of the entrances of the passageways into the school —”
18248,"“Sounds like a job for us,” called Fred, indicating himself and"
18249,"George, and Kingsley nodded his approval."
18250,"“All right, leaders up here and we’ll divide up the troops!”"
18251,"“Potter,” said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as stu-"
18252,"dents flooded the platform, jostling for position, receiving instruc-"
18253,"tions, “Aren’t you supposed to be looking for something?”"
18254,"“What? Oh,” said Harry, “oh yeah!”"
18255,"He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten"
18256,that the battle was being fought so that he could search for it: The
18257, 611   
18258,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18259,inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven
18260,every other thought from his mind.
18261,"“Then go, Potter, go!”"
18262,“Right — yeah —”
18263,He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall
18264,"again, into the entrance hall still crowded with evacuating students."
18265,"He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with them,"
18266,but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and
18267,"panic were clouding his thought processes. He tried to calm himself,"
18268,"to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his thoughts buzzed as"
18269,frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without
18270,Ron and Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his
18271,"ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt halfway along an empty"
18272,"passage, where he sat down upon the plinth of a departed statue and"
18273,pulled the Marauder’s Map out of the pouch around his neck. He
18274,"could not see Ron’s or Hermione’s names anywhere on it, though"
18275,the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room
18276,"of Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put"
18277,"the map away, pressed his hands over his face, and closed his eyes,"
18278,trying to concentrate. . . .
18279,Voldemort thought I’d go to Ravenclaw Tower.
18280,"There it was: a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had sta-"
18281,"tioned Alecto Carrow in the Ravenclaw common room, and there"
18282,could only be one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry already
18283,knew his Horcrux was connected to that House.
18284,But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw
18285,was the lost diadem . . . and how could the Horcrux be the diadem?
18286,"How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found the"
18287,diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could
18288, 612   
18289,THE BATTLE OF
18290,HOGWARTS
18291,"have told him where to look, when nobody had seen the diadem in"
18292,living memory?
18293,In living memory . . .
18294,"Beneath his fingers, Harry’s eyes flew open again. He leapt up"
18295,"from the plinth and tore back the way he had come, now in pursuit"
18296,of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching
18297,toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he
18298,"returned to the marble stairs. Prefects were shouting instructions,"
18299,trying to keep track of the students in their own Houses; there
18300,was much pushing and shoving; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowl-
18301,ing over first-years to get to the front of the queue; here and there
18302,"younger students were in tears, while older ones called desperately"
18303,for friends or siblings. . . .
18304,Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the en-
18305,trance hall below and yelled as loudly as he could over the clamor.
18306,“Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!”
18307,"He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reach-"
18308,"ing the bottom of the stairs, where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of"
18309,"Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him."
18310,“Harry! My dear boy!”
18311,Nick made to grasp Harry’s hands with both of his own: Harry’s
18312,felt as though they had been thrust into icy water.
18313,"“Nick, you’ve got to help me. Who’s the ghost of Ravenclaw"
18314,Tower?”
18315,Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.
18316,"“The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you"
18317,require — ?”
18318,“It’s got to be her — d’you know where she is?”
18319,“Let’s see. . . .”
18320, 613   
18321,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18322,Nick’s head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and
18323,"thither, peering over the heads of the swarming students."
18324,"“That’s her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long"
18325,hair.”
18326,"Harry looked in the direction of Nick’s transparent, pointing"
18327,"finger and saw a tall ghost who caught sight of Harry looking at her,"
18328,"raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall."
18329,Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into
18330,"which she had disappeared, he saw her at the very end of the pas-"
18331,"sage, still gliding smoothly away from him."
18332,“Hey — wait — come back!”
18333,"She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground."
18334,"Harry supposed that she was beautiful, with her waist-length hair"
18335,"and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud."
18336,"Close to, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times"
18337,"in the corridor, but to whom he had never spoken."
18338,“You’re the Gray Lady?”
18339,She nodded but did not speak.
18340,“The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?”
18341,“That is correct.”
18342,Her tone was not encouraging.
18343,“Please: I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell
18344,me about the lost diadem.”
18345,A cold smile curved her lips.
18346,"“I am afraid,” she said, turning to leave, “that I cannot help you.”"
18347,“WAIT!”
18348,"He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening"
18349,to overwhelm him. He glanced at his watch as she hovered in front
18350,of him: It was a quarter to midnight.
18351, 614   

18354,"“This is urgent,” he said fiercely. “If that diadem’s at Hogwarts,"
18355,"I’ve got to find it, fast.”"
18356,"“You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem,” she said"
18357,disdainfully. “Generations of students have badgered me —”
18358,“This isn’t about trying to get better marks!” Harry shouted at
18359,her. “It’s about Voldemort — defeating Voldemort — or aren’t you
18360,interested in that?”
18361,"She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more"
18362,"opaque, and her voice was heated as she replied, “Of course I — how"
18363,dare you suggest — ?”
18364,"“Well, help me, then!”"
18365,Her composure was slipping.
18366,“It — it is not a question of —” she stammered. “My mother’s
18367,diadem —”
18368,“Your mother’s?”
18369,She looked angry with herself.
18370,"“When I lived,” she said stiffly, “I was Helena Ravenclaw.”"
18371,"“You’re her daughter? But then, you must know what happened"
18372,to it!”
18373,"“While the diadem bestows wisdom,” she said with an obvious"
18374,"effort to pull herself together, “I doubt that it would greatly increase"
18375,your chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord —”
18376,"“Haven’t I just told you, I’m not interested in wearing it!” Harry"
18377,said fiercely. “There’s no time to explain — but if you care about
18378,"Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you’ve got to tell"
18379,me anything you know about the diadem!”
18380,"She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him,"
18381,"and a sense of hopelessness engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had"
18382,"known anything, she would have told Flitwick or Dumbledore, who"
18383,  615 
18384,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18385,had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and
18386,made to turn away when she spoke in a low voice.
18387,“I stole the diadem from my mother.”
18388,“You — you did what?”
18389,"“I stole the diadem,” repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. “I"
18390,"sought to make myself cleverer, more important than my mother."
18391,I ran away with it.”
18392,"He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence,"
18393,"and did not ask; he simply listened, hard, as she went on:"
18394,"“My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone,"
18395,"but pretended that she had it still. She concealed her loss, my dread-"
18396,"ful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts."
18397,"“Then my mother fell ill — fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy, she"
18398,was desperate to see me one more time. She sent a man who had
18399,"long loved me, though I spurned his advances, to find me. She knew"
18400,that he would not rest until he had done so.”
18401,Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head.
18402,“He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused
18403,"to return with him, he became violent. The Baron was always a"
18404,"hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom,"
18405,he stabbed me.”
18406,“The Baron? You mean — ?”
18407,"“The Bloody Baron, yes,” said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside"
18408,the cloak she wore to reveal a single dark wound in her white chest.
18409,"“When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with remorse."
18410,"He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill"
18411,"himself. All these centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of"
18412,"penitence . . . as he should,” she added bitterly."
18413, 616   
18414,THE BATTLE OF
18415,HOGWARTS
18416,“And . . . and the diadem?”
18417,“It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blun-
18418,dering through the forest toward me. Concealed inside a hollow
18419,tree.
18420,“A hollow tree?” repeated Harry. “What tree? Where was this?”
18421,“A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my
18422,mother’s reach.”
18423,"“Albania,” repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously"
18424,"from confusion, and now he understood why she was telling him"
18425,what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. “You’ve already told
18426,"someone this story, haven’t you? Another student?”"
18427,She closed her eyes and nodded.
18428,“I had . . . no idea. . . . He was . . . flattering. He seemed to . . .
18429,to understand . . . to sympathize. . . .”
18430,"Yes, Harry thought, Tom Riddle would certainly have understood"
18431,Helena Ravenclaw’s desire to possess fabulous objects to which she
18432,had little right.
18433,"“Well, you weren’t the first person Riddle wormed things out of,”"
18434,Harry muttered. “He could be charming when he wanted. . . .”
18435,So Voldemort had managed to wheedle the location of the lost
18436,diadem out of the Gray Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung
18437,"forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, perhaps as"
18438,"soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin"
18439,and Burkes.
18440,And wouldn’t those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an
18441,"excellent refuge when, so much later, Voldemort had needed a place"
18442,"to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years?"
18443,"But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not"
18444, 617    
18445,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18446,"been left in that lowly tree. . . . No, the diadem had been returned"
18447,"secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there —"
18448,"“— the night he asked for a job!” said Harry, finishing his"
18449,thought.
18450,“I beg your pardon?”
18451,"“He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumble-"
18452,dore to let him teach!” said Harry. Saying it out loud enabled him
18453,to make sense of it all. “He must’ve hidden the diadem on his way
18454,"up to, or down from, Dumbledore’s office! But it was still worth"
18455,trying to get the job — then he might’ve got the chance to nick
18456,"Gryffindor’s sword as well — thank you, thanks!”"
18457,"Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he"
18458,"rounded the corner back into the entrance hall, he checked his watch."
18459,"It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew what the"
18460,"last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was. . . ."
18461,Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that sug-
18462,"gested that it was not in Ravenclaw Tower — but if not there, where?"
18463,What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside Hogwarts
18464,"Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever?"
18465,"Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had"
18466,taken only a few steps down the new corridor when the window to
18467,"his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he leapt"
18468,"aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the op-"
18469,"posite wall. Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering,"
18470,from the new arrival and flung itself at Harry.
18471,"“Hagrid!” Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound’s"
18472,attentions as the enormous bearded figure clambered to his feet.
18473,“What the — ?”
18474,"“Harry, yer here! Yer here!”"
18475,  618 
18476,THE BATTLE OF
18477,HOGWARTS
18478,"Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-"
18479,"cracking hug, then ran back to the shattered window."
18480,"“Good boy, Grawpy!” he bellowed through the hole in the win-"
18481,"dow. “I’ll see yer in a moment, there’s a good lad!”"
18482,"Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light"
18483,"in the distance and heard a weird, keening scream. He looked down"
18484,at his watch: It was midnight. The battle had begun.
18485,"“Blimey, Harry,” panted Hagrid, “this is it, eh? Time ter fight?”"
18486,"“Hagrid, where have you come from?”"
18487,"“Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,” said Hagrid"
18488,"grimly. “Voice carried, didn’ it? ‘Yeh got till midnight ter gimme"
18489,"Potter.’ Knew yeh mus’ be here, knew what mus’ be happenin’."
18490,"Get down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an’ Grawpy an’ Fang."
18491,"Smashed our way through the boundary by the forest, Grawpy was"
18492,"carryin’ us, Fang an’ me. Told him ter let me down at the castle, so"
18493,"he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exac’ly what I"
18494,"meant, bu’ — where’s Ron an’ Hermione?”"
18495,"“That,” said Harry, “is a really good question. Come on.”"
18496,"They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping beside"
18497,them. Harry could hear movement through the corridors all around:
18498,"running footsteps, shouts; through the windows, he could see more"
18499,flashes of light in the dark grounds.
18500,"“Where’re we goin’?” puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry’s"
18501,"heels, making the floorboards quake."
18502,"“I dunno exactly,” said Harry, making another random turn,"
18503,“but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere. . . .”
18504,The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the
18505,passage ahead: The two stone gargoyles that usually guarded the
18506,entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that
18507, 619  
18508,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18509,had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred
18510,"feebly on the floor, and as Harry leapt over one of their disembodied"
18511,"heads, it moaned faintly, “Oh, don’t mind me . . . I’ll just lie here"
18512,and crumble. . . .”
18513,Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust
18514,"of Rowena Ravenclaw at Xenophilius’s house, wearing that mad"
18515,"headdress — and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, with the"
18516,stone diadem upon her white curls. . . .
18517,"And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third"
18518,"stone effigy came back to him: that of an ugly old warlock, onto"
18519,whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a battered old tiara.
18520,"The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he"
18521,nearly stumbled.
18522,"He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him. . . ."
18523,"Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might"
18524,"have been arrogant enough to assume that he, and only he, had"
18525,"penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course,"
18526,"Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in"
18527,"that particular place, but he, Harry, had strayed off the beaten track"
18528,in his time at school — here at last was a secret he and Voldemort
18529,"knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered —"
18530,"He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past"
18531,"followed by Neville and half a dozen others, all of them wearing"
18532,earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants.
18533,“Mandrakes!” Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he
18534,ran. “Going to lob them over the walls — they won’t like this!”
18535,"Harry knew now where to go: He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang"
18536,"galloping behind him. They passed portrait after portrait, and the"
18537, 620  
18538,THE BATTLE OF
18539,HOGWARTS
18540,"painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in ruffs"
18541,"and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each"
18542,"others’ canvases, screaming news from other parts of the castle. As"
18543,"they reached the end of this corridor, the whole castle shook, and"
18544,"Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive"
18545,"force, that it was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than"
18546,those of the teachers and the Order.
18547,"“It’s all righ’, Fang — it’s all righ’!” yelled Hagrid, but the great"
18548,boarhound had taken flight as slivers of china flew like shrapnel
18549,"through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog,"
18550,leaving Harry alone.
18551,"He forged on through the trembling passages, his wand at the"
18552,"ready, and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight,"
18553,"Sir Cadogan, rushed from painting to painting beside him, clank-"
18554,"ing along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony"
18555,cantering behind him.
18556,"“Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out,"
18557,"Harry Potter, see them off!”"
18558,Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot
18559,"of students, including Lee Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing"
18560,"beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a secret"
18561,passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the
18562,concealed hole.
18563,"“Nice night for it!” Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and"
18564,"Harry sprinted by, elated and terrified in equal measure. Along yet"
18565,"another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls everywhere,"
18566,"and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws,"
18567,no doubt to return them to their proper place. . . .
18568, 621   
18569,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18570,“Potter!”
18571,"Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his"
18572,wand held ready.
18573,"“I’ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!”"
18574,"“I know, we’re evacuating,” Harry said, “Voldemort’s —”"
18575,"“— attacking because they haven’t handed you over, yeah,” said"
18576,"Aberforth, “I’m not deaf, the whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And"
18577,it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins hostage?
18578,There are kids of Death Eaters you’ve just sent to safety. Wouldn’t
18579,it have been a bit smarter to keep ’em here?”
18580,"“It wouldn’t stop Voldemort,” said Harry, “and your brother"
18581,would never have done it.”
18582,Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction.
18583,"Your brother would never have done it. . . . Well, it was the truth,"
18584,"Harry thought as he ran on again; Dumbledore, who had defended"
18585,"Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. . . ."
18586,And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of
18587,"mingled relief and fury he saw them: Ron and Hermione, both"
18588,"with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with"
18589,a broomstick under his arm.
18590,“Where the hell have you been?” Harry shouted.
18591,"“Chamber of Secrets,” said Ron."
18592,"“Chamber — what?” said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt"
18593,before them.
18594,"“It was Ron, all Ron’s idea!” said Hermione breathlessly. “Wasn’t"
18595,"it absolutely brilliant? There we were, after you left, and I said to"
18596,"Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of"
18597,it? We still hadn’t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The
18598,basilisk!”
18599, 622   
18600,THE BATTLE OF
18601,HOGWARTS
18602,“What the — ?”
18603,"“Something to get rid of Horcruxes,” said Ron simply."
18604,Harry’s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermi-
18605,"one’s arms: great curved fangs, torn, he now realized, from the skull"
18606,of a dead basilisk.
18607,"“But how did you get in there?” he asked, staring from the fangs"
18608,to Ron. “You need to speak Parseltongue!”
18609,"“He did!” whispered Hermione. “Show him, Ron!”"
18610,Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise.
18611,"“It’s what you did to open the locket,” he told Harry apologeti-"
18612,"cally. “I had to have a few goes to get it right, but,” he shrugged"
18613,"modestly, “we got there in the end.”"
18614,“He was amazing.” said Hermione. “Amazing!”
18615,“So . . .” Harry was struggling to keep up. “So . . .”
18616,"“So we’re another Horcrux down,” said Ron, and from under his"
18617,jacket he pulled the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup. “Hermione
18618,stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn’t had the pleasure yet.”
18619,“Genius!” yelled Harry.
18620,"“It was nothing,” said Ron, though he looked delighted with"
18621,himself. “So what’s new with you?”
18622,"As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead: All three"
18623,of them looked up as dust fell from the ceiling and they heard a
18624,distant scream.
18625,"“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” said"
18626,"Harry, talking fast. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions"
18627,"book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought"
18628,he was the only one to find it. Come on.”
18629,"As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through"
18630,the concealed entrance and down the staircase into the Room of
18631,  623  
18632,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18633,"Requirement. It was empty except for three women: Ginny, Tonks,"
18634,"and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry rec-"
18635,ognized immediately as Neville’s grandmother.
18636,"“Ah, Potter,” she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him."
18637,“You can tell us what’s going on.”
18638,“Is everyone okay?” said Ginny and Tonks together.
18639,"“ ’S far as we know,” said Harry. “Are there still people in the pas-"
18640,sage to the Hog’s Head?”
18641,He knew that the room would not be able to transform while
18642,there were still users inside it.
18643,"“I was the last to come through,” said Mrs. Longbottom. “I sealed"
18644,"it, I think it unwise to leave it open now Aberforth has left his pub."
18645,Have you seen my grandson?”
18646,"“He’s fighting,” said Harry."
18647,"“Naturally,” said the old lady proudly. “Excuse me, I must go"
18648,and assist him.”
18649,With surprising speed she trotted off toward the stone steps.
18650,Harry looked at Tonks.
18651,“I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your
18652,mother’s?”
18653,“I couldn’t stand not knowing —” Tonks looked anguished.
18654,“She’ll look after him — have you seen Remus?”
18655,“He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the
18656,grounds —”
18657,"Without another word, Tonks sped off."
18658,"“Ginny,” said Harry, “I’m sorry, but we need you to leave too."
18659,Just for a bit. Then you can come back in.”
18660,Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary.
18661, 624  
18662,THE BATTLE OF
18663,HOGWARTS
18664,“And then you can come back in!” he shouted after her as she ran
18665,up the steps after Tonks. “You’ve got to come back in!”
18666,“Hang on a moment!” said Ron sharply. “We’ve forgotten
18667,someone!”
18668,“Who?” asked Hermione.
18669,"“The house-elves, they’ll all be down in the kitchen, won’t"
18670,they?”
18671,“You mean we ought to get them fighting?” asked Harry.
18672,"“No,” said Ron seriously, “I mean we should tell them to get out."
18673,"We don’t want any more Dobbies, do we? We can’t order them to"
18674,die for us —”
18675,There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermi-
18676,"one’s arms. Running at Ron, she flung them around his neck and"
18677,kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and broom-
18678,stick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he
18679,lifted Hermione off her feet.
18680,"“Is this the moment?” Harry asked weakly, and when nothing"
18681,happened except that Ron and Hermione gripped each other still
18682,"more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. “OI! There’s"
18683,a war going on here!”
18684,"Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each"
18685,other.
18686,"“I know, mate,” said Ron, who looked as though he had recently"
18687,"been hit on the back of the head with a Bludger, “so it’s now or"
18688,"never, isn’t it?”"
18689,"“Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?” Harry shouted."
18690,“D’you think you could just — just hold it in until we’ve got the
18691,diadem?”
18692, 625   
18693,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18694,"“Yeah — right — sorry —” said Ron, and he and Hermione set"
18695,"about gathering up fangs, both pink in the face."
18696,"It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor"
18697,"upstairs, that in the minutes that they had spent in the Room of"
18698,Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated se-
18699,verely: The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust
18700,"filled the air, and through the nearest window, Harry saw bursts of"
18701,green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he knew
18702,the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Look-
18703,"ing down, Harry saw Grawp the giant meandering past, swinging"
18704,what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and roaring
18705,his displeasure.
18706,“Let’s hope he steps on some of them!” said Ron as more screams
18707,echoed from close by.
18708,“As long as it’s not any of our lot!” said a voice: Harry turned and
18709,"saw Ginny and Tonks, both with their wands drawn at the next win-"
18710,"dow, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, Ginny"
18711,sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below.
18712,“Good girl!” roared a figure running through the dust toward
18713,"them, and Harry saw Aberforth again, his gray hair flying as he led a"
18714,small group of students past. “They look like they might be breach-
18715,"ing the north battlements, they’ve brought giants of their own!”"
18716,“Have you seen Remus?” Tonks called after him.
18717,"“He was dueling Dolohov,” shouted Aberforth, “haven’t seen him"
18718,since!
18719,"“Tonks,” said Ginny, “Tonks, I’m sure he’s okay —”"
18720,But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth.
18721,"Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione."
18722,"“They’ll be all right,” said Harry, though he knew they were"
18723, 626   
18724,THE BATTLE OF
18725,HOGWARTS
18726,"empty words. “Ginny, we’ll be back in a moment, just keep out"
18727,"of the way, keep safe — come on!” he said to Ron and Hermione,"
18728,and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of
18729,Requirement was waiting to do the bidding of the next entrant.
18730,"I need the place where everything is hidden, Harry begged of it in-"
18731,"side his head, and the door materialized on their third run past."
18732,The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the thresh-
18733,old and closed the door behind them: All was silent. They were
18734,"in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its"
18735,towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone
18736,students.
18737,"“And he never realized anyone could get in?” said Ron, his voice"
18738,echoing in the silence.
18739,"“He thought he was the only one,” said Harry. “Too bad for him"
18740,"I’ve had to hide stuff in my time . . . this way,” he added, “I think"
18741,it’s down here. . . .”
18742,He passed the stuffed troll and the Vanishing Cabinet Draco
18743,"Malfoy had mended last year with such disastrous consequences,"
18744,"then hesitated, looking up and down aisles of junk; he could not"
18745,remember where to go next. . . .
18746,"“Accio Diadem!” cried Hermione in desperation, but nothing flew"
18747,"through the air toward them. It seemed that, like the vault at Grin-"
18748,"gotts, the room would not yield its hidden objects that easily."
18749,"“Let’s split up,” Harry told the other two. “Look for a stone bust"
18750,of an old man wearing a wig and a tiara! It’s standing on a cupboard
18751,and it’s definitely somewhere near here. . . .”
18752,They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others’
18753,"footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk, of bottles,"
18754,"hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats. . . ."
18755, 627   
18756,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18757,"“Somewhere near here,” Harry muttered to himself. “Some-"
18758,where . . . somewhere . . .”
18759,"Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects"
18760,he recognized from his one previous trip into the room. His breath
18761,"was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to shiver: There"
18762,"it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hid-"
18763,"den his old Potions book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone"
18764,"warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked like an ancient,"
18765,discolored tiara.
18766,"He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained ten"
18767,"feet away, when a voice behind him said, “Hold it, Potter.”"
18768,He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were
18769,"standing behind him, shoulder to shoulder, wands pointing right"
18770,at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he
18771,saw Draco Malfoy.
18772,"“That’s my wand you’re holding, Potter,” said Malfoy, pointing"
18773,his own through the gap between Crabbe and Goyle.
18774,"“Not anymore,” panted Harry, tightening his grip on the haw-"
18775,"thorn wand. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”"
18776,"“My mother,” said Draco."
18777,"Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about"
18778,the situation. He could not hear Ron or Hermione anymore. They
18779,"seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem."
18780,“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry.
18781,"“We’re gonna be rewarded,” said Crabbe: His voice was surpris-"
18782,ingly soft for such an enormous person; Harry had hardly ever heard
18783,him speak before. Crabbe was smiling like a small child promised
18784,"a large bag of sweets. “We ’ung back, Potter. We decided not to go."
18785,Decided to bring you to ’im.”

18789,"“Good plan,” said Harry in mock admiration. He could not be-"
18790,"lieve that he was this close, and was going to be thwarted by Malfoy,"
18791,"Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward toward the"
18792,place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just
18793,get his hands on it before the fight broke out . . .
18794,"“So how did you get in here?” he asked, trying to distract them."
18795,"“I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,”"
18796,"said Malfoy, his voice brittle. “I know how to get in.”"
18797,"“We was hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can"
18798,"do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,” his face split into a gormless"
18799,"grin, “you turned up right in front of us and said you was looking"
18800,for a die-dum! What’s a die-dum?”
18801,“Harry?” Ron’s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the
18802,wall to Harry’s right. “Are you talking to someone?”
18803,"With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the"
18804,"fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, of broken trunks, of old books"
18805,"and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”"
18806,"The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the"
18807,aisle next door where Ron stood.
18808,"“Ron!” Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione"
18809,"screamed, and Harry heard innumerable objects crashing to the"
18810,floor on the other side of the destabilized wall: He pointed his wand
18811,"at the rampart, cried, “Finite!” and it steadied."
18812,"“No!” shouted Malfoy, staying Crabbe’s arm as the latter made"
18813,to repeat his spell. “If you wreck the room you might bury this
18814,diadem thing!”
18815,"“What’s that matter?” said Crabbe, tugging himself free. “It’s"
18816,"Potter the Dark Lord wants, who cares about a die-dum?”"
18817,"“Potter came in here to get it,” said Malfoy with ill-disguised"
18818, 629  
18819,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18820,"impatience at the slow-wittedness of his colleagues, “so that must"
18821,mean —”
18822,“ ‘Must mean’?” Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised fe-
18823,"rocity. “Who cares what you think? I don’t take your orders no more,"
18824,Draco. You an’ your dad are finished.”
18825,"“Harry?” shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk"
18826,wall. “What’s going on?”
18827,"“Harry?” mimicked Crabbe. “What’s going — no, Potter!"
18828,Crucio!”
18829,Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe’s curse missed him but hit
18830,"the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward"
18831,and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the
18832,bust had rested.
18833,"“STOP!” Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through"
18834,the enormous room. “The Dark Lord wants him alive —”
18835,"“So? I’m not killing him, am I?” yelled Crabbe, throwing off"
18836,"Malfoy’s restraining arm. “But if I can, I will, the Dark Lord wants"
18837,"him dead anyway, what’s the diff — ?”"
18838,A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches: Hermione had run
18839,around the corner behind him and sent a Stunning Spell straight
18840,at Crabbe’s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out of
18841,the way.
18842,“It’s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!”
18843,"Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had"
18844,aimed to kill wiped all else from his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell
18845,"at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy’s wand"
18846,out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken
18847,furniture and boxes.
18848,“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!” Malfoy yelled at Crabbe
18849, 630  
18850,THE BATTLE OF
18851,HOGWARTS
18852,"and Goyle, who were both aiming at Harry: Their split second’s"
18853,hesitation was all Harry needed.
18854,“Expelliarmus!”
18855,Goyle’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bul-
18856,"wark of objects beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying"
18857,to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of Hermione’s second
18858,"Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle,"
18859,"shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed."
18860,"Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, “Avada Kedavra!” again."
18861,Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. The wand-
18862,less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione
18863,"charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she"
18864,came.
18865,"“It’s somewhere here!” Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile"
18866,of junk into which the old tiara had fallen. “Look for it while I go
18867,and help R —”
18868,“HARRY!” she screamed.
18869,"A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment’s"
18870,warning. He turned and saw both Ron and Crabbe running as hard
18871,as they could up the aisle toward them.
18872,"“Like it hot, scum?” roared Crabbe as he ran."
18873,But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames
18874,"of abnormal size were pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk"
18875,"bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their touch."
18876,"“Aguamenti !” Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from"
18877,the tip of his wand evaporated in the air.
18878,“RUN!”
18879,Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along;
18880,"Crabbe outstripped all of them, now looking terrified; Harry, Ron,"
18881, 631  
18882,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18883,"and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them."
18884,It was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had
18885,no knowledge: As they turned a corner the flames chased them as
18886,"though they were alive, sentient, intent upon killing them. Now the"
18887,"fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts: Flaming"
18888,"serpents, chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and"
18889,the detritus of centuries on which they were feeding was thrown
18890,"up in the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet,"
18891,before being consumed by the inferno.
18892,"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view: Harry, Ron,"
18893,"and Hermione stopped dead; the fiery monsters were circling them,"
18894,"drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, and the"
18895,heat was solid as a wall around them.
18896,“What can we do?” Hermione screamed over the deafening roars
18897,of the fire. “What can we do?”
18898,“Here!”
18899,Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest
18900,"pile of junk and threw one to Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it"
18901,"behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, with"
18902,"hard kicks to the ground, they soared up into the air, missing by feet"
18903,the horned beak of a flaming raptor that snapped its jaws at them.
18904,The smoke and heat were becoming overwhelming: Below them the
18905,cursed fire was consuming the contraband of generations of hunted
18906,"students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments,"
18907,the secrets of the countless souls who had sought refuge in the room.
18908,"Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, or Goyle anywhere:"
18909,He swooped as low as he dared over the marauding monsters of
18910,"flame to try to find them, but there was nothing but fire: What a"
18911,terrible way to die. . . . He had never wanted this. . . .
18912, 632  
18913,THE BATTLE OF
18914,HOGWARTS
18915,"“Harry, let’s get out, let’s get out!” bellowed Ron, though it was"
18916,impossible to see where the door was through the black smoke.
18917,"And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst"
18918,"the terrible commotion, the thunder of devouring flame."
18919,"“It’s — too — dangerous — !” Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in"
18920,the air. His glasses giving his eyes some small protection from the
18921,"smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb"
18922,or a face that was not yet charred like wood. . . .
18923,And he saw them: Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious
18924,"Goyle, the pair of them perched on a fragile tower of charred desks,"
18925,"and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, but"
18926,even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good: Goyle
18927,"was too heavy and Malfoy’s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly"
18928,out of Harry’s —
18929,"“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” roared"
18930,"Ron’s voice, and, as a great flaming chimaera bore down upon them,"
18931,"he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and rose, roll-"
18932,"ing and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up"
18933,behind Harry.
18934,"“The door, get to the door, the door!” screamed Malfoy in Har-"
18935,"ry’s ear, and Harry sped up, following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle"
18936,"through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe: and all"
18937,around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames
18938,"were flung into the air, as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them"
18939,"high in celebration: cups and shields, a sparkling necklace, and an"
18940,"old, discolored tiara —"
18941,"“What are you doing, what are you doing, the door’s that way!”"
18942,"screamed Malfoy, but Harry made a hairpin swerve and dived. The"
18943,"diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering as it"
18944, 633   
18945,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
18946,"dropped toward the maw of a yawning serpent, and then he had it,"
18947,caught it around his wrist —
18948,Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared
18949,"upward and straight toward the place where, he prayed, the door"
18950,"stood open: Ron, Hermione, and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was"
18951,"screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the"
18952,"smoke, Harry saw a rectangular patch on the wall and steered the"
18953,"broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they"
18954,collided with the wall in the corridor beyond.
18955,"Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing,"
18956,and retching. Harry rolled over and sat up: The door to the Room
18957,"of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat panting"
18958,"on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious."
18959,"“C-Crabbe,” choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. “C-"
18960,Crabbe . . .”
18961,"“He’s dead,” said Ron harshly."
18962,"There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a num-"
18963,"ber of huge bangs shook the castle, and a great cavalcade of trans-"
18964,"parent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with"
18965,bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the
18966,Headless Hunt had passed and looked around: The battle was still
18967,going on all around him. He could hear more screams than those
18968,of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him.
18969,“Where’s Ginny?” he said sharply. “She was here. She was sup-
18970,posed to be going back into the Room of Requirement.”
18971,"“Blimey, d’you reckon it’ll still work after that fire?” asked Ron,"
18972,"but he too got to his feet, rubbing his chest and looking left and"
18973,right. “Shall we split up and look — ?”
18974,"“No,” said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle"
18975, 634   
18976,THE BATTLE OF
18977,HOGWARTS
18978,remained slumped hopelessly on the corridor floor; neither of them
18979,"had wands. “Let’s stick together. I say we go — Harry, what’s that"
18980,on your arm?”
18981,“What? Oh yeah —”
18982,He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still
18983,"hot, blackened with soot, but as he looked at it closely he was just"
18984,able to make out the tiny words etched upon it: Wit beyond mea-
18985,sure is man’s greatest treasure.
18986,"A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from"
18987,"the diadem. Suddenly Harry felt the thing vibrate violently, then"
18988,"break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard the"
18989,"faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds"
18990,"or the castle, but from the thing that had just fragmented in his"
18991,fingers.
18992,"“It must have been Fiendfyre!” whimpered Hermione, her eyes"
18993,on the broken pieces.
18994,“Sorry?”
18995,“Fiendfyre — cursed fire — it’s one of the substances that destroy
18996,"Horcruxes, but I would never, ever have dared use it, it’s so danger-"
18997,ous — how did Crabbe know how to — ?”
18998,"“Must’ve learned from the Carrows,” said Harry grimly."
18999,“Shame he wasn’t concentrating when they mentioned how to
19000,"stop it, really,” said Ron, whose hair, like Hermione’s, was singed,"
19001,"and whose face was blackened. “If he hadn’t tried to kill us all, I’d"
19002,be quite sorry he was dead.”
19003,"“But don’t you realize?” whispered Hermione. “This means, if we"
19004,can just get the snake —”
19005,But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises
19006,of dueling filled the corridor. Harry looked around and his heart
19007, 635  
19008,CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE
19009,seemed to fail: Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and
19010,"Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and"
19011,hooded men.
19012,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light"
19013,"flew in every direction and the man dueling Percy backed off, fast:"
19014,Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked
19015,hair —
19016,"“Hello, Minister!” bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight"
19017,"at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of"
19018,"his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. “Did I mention I’m"
19019,resigning?”
19020,"“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was"
19021,battling collapsed under the weight of three separate Stunning
19022,Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes erupt-
19023,ing all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea
19024,urchin. Fred looked at Percy with glee.
19025,"“You actually are joking, Perce. . . . I don’t think I’ve heard you"
19026,joke since you were —”
19027,"The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron,"
19028,"Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the two Death Eaters at their feet, one"
19029,"Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a moment,"
19030,"when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart."
19031,"Harry felt himself flying through the air, and all he could do was"
19032,hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood that was his
19033,"one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms: He heard"
19034,the screams and yells of his companions without a hope of knowing
19035,what had happened to them —
19036,And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness:
19037,He was half buried in the wreckage of a corridor that had been
19038, 636  
19039,THE BATTLE OF
19040,HOGWARTS
19041,subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of the
19042,"castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told"
19043,him that he was bleeding copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that
19044,"pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind neither flame"
19045,"nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened"
19046,"than he had been that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had"
19047,been in his life. . . .
19048,"And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and"
19049,three redheaded men were grouped on the ground where the wall
19050,had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione’s hand as they staggered
19051,and stumbled over stone and wood.
19052,“No — no — no!” someone was shouting. “No! Fred! No!”
19053,"And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside"
19054,"them, and Fred’s eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last"
19055,laugh still etched upon his face.
19056, 637  
19057,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19058,THE ELDER WAND
19059,"T      he world had ended, so why had the battle not ceased, the"
19060,"castle fallen silent in horror, and every combatant laid down"
19061,"their arms? Harry’s mind was in free fall, spinning out of control,"
19062,"unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred Weasley could not"
19063,"be dead, the evidence of all his senses must be lying —"
19064,And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the
19065,"school, and curses flew in at them from the darkness, hitting the"
19066,wall behind their heads.
19067,"“Get down!” Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the"
19068,night: He and Ron had both grabbed Hermione and pulled her
19069,"to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred’s body, shielding it from fur-"
19070,"ther harm, and when Harry shouted, “Percy, come on, we’ve got to"
19071,move!” he shook his head.
19072,“Percy!” Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron’s
19073,"face as he seized his elder brother’s shoulders and pulled, but Percy"
19074, 638   
19075,THE ELDER WAND
19076,"would not budge. “Percy, you can’t do anything for him! We’re go-"
19077,ing to —”
19078,"Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask"
19079,why. A monstrous spider the size of a small car was trying to climb
19080,through the huge hole in the wall: One of Aragog’s descendants
19081,had joined the fight.
19082,Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the
19083,"monster was blown backward, its legs jerking horribly, and vanished"
19084,into the darkness.
19085,"“It brought friends!” Harry called to the others, glancing over the"
19086,edge of the castle through the hole in the wall the curses had blasted:
19087,"More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, liberated"
19088,"from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have"
19089,"penetrated. Harry fired Stunning Spells down upon them, knock-"
19090,"ing the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled back down"
19091,the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over
19092,"Harry’s head, so close he felt the force of them blow his hair."
19093,"“Let’s move, NOW!”"
19094,"Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to"
19095,"seize Fred’s body under the armpits. Percy, realizing what Harry"
19096,"was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped; together,"
19097,"crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds,"
19098,they hauled Fred out of the way.
19099,"“Here,” said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit"
19100,of armor had stood earlier. He could not bear to look at Fred a sec-
19101,"ond longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body was"
19102,"well hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle"
19103,"had vanished, but at the end of the corridor, which was now full"
19104, 639   
19105,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19106,"of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from the windows, he"
19107,"saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends"
19108,"or foes he could not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-"
19109,like roar: “ROOKWOOD!” and sprinted off in the direction of a
19110,"tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students."
19111,"“Harry, in here!” Hermione screamed."
19112,She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry: They seemed to be wres-
19113,"tling together, and for one mad second Harry thought that they were"
19114,embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to restrain
19115,"Ron, to stop him running after Percy."
19116,"“Listen to me — LISTEN, RON !”"
19117,“I wanna help — I wanna kill Death Eaters —”
19118,"His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he"
19119,was shaking with rage and grief.
19120,"“Ron, we’re the only ones who can end it! Please — Ron — we"
19121,"need the snake, we’ve got to kill the snake!” said Hermione."
19122,But Harry knew how Ron felt: Pursuing another Horcrux could
19123,"not bring the satisfaction of revenge; he too wanted to fight, to"
19124,"punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to"
19125,"find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure,"
19126,that Ginny was not — but he could not permit that idea to form
19127,in his mind —
19128,"“We will fight!” Hermione said. “We’ll have to, to reach the snake!"
19129,But let’s not lose sight now of what we’re supposed to be d-doing!
19130,We’re the only ones who can end it!”
19131,"She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed"
19132,"sleeve as she spoke, but she took great heaving breaths to calm herself"
19133,"as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry."

19136,"“You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he’ll have the"
19137,"snake with him, won’t he? Do it, Harry — look inside him!”"
19138,"Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours,"
19139,yearning to show him Voldemort’s thoughts? He closed his eyes on
19140,"her command, and at once, the screams and the bangs and all the"
19141,discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became
19142,"distant, as though he stood far, far away from them. . . ."
19143,He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar
19144,"room, with peeling paper on the walls and all the windows boarded"
19145,except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle were muffled
19146,and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of
19147,"light where the castle stood, but inside the room it was dark except"
19148,for a solitary oil lamp.
19149,"He was rolling his wand between his fingers, watching it, his"
19150,"thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he had ever"
19151,"found, the room, like the Chamber, that you had to be clever and"
19152,cunning and inquisitive to discover. . . . He was confident that the
19153,boy would not find the diadem . . . although Dumbledore’s puppet
19154,had come much farther than he had ever expected . . . too far. . . .
19155,"“My Lord,” said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned: There"
19156,"was Lucius Malfoy sitting in the darkest corner, ragged and still"
19157,bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the boy’s
19158,last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. “My Lord . . .
19159,please . . . my son . . .”
19160,"“If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come"
19161,"and join me, like the rest of the Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided"
19162,to befriend Harry Potter?”
19163,"“No — never,” whispered Malfoy."

19165,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19166,“You must hope not.”
19167,"“Aren’t — aren’t you afraid, my Lord, that Potter might die at an-"
19168,"other hand but yours?” asked Malfoy, his voice shaking. “Wouldn’t"
19169,"it be . . . forgive me . . . more prudent to call off this battle, enter"
19170,"the castle, and seek him y-yourself?”"
19171,"“Do not pretend, Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you"
19172,can discover what has happened to your son. And I do not need to seek
19173,"Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have come to find me.”"
19174,Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers.
19175,It troubled him . . . and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort
19176,needed to be rearranged. . . .
19177,“Go and fetch Snape.”
19178,"“Snape, m-my Lord?”"
19179,“Snape. Now. I need him. There is a — service — I require from
19180,him. Go.”
19181,"Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left"
19182,"the room. Voldemort continued to stand there, twirling the wand"
19183,"between his fingers, staring at it."
19184,"“It is the only way, Nagini,” he whispered, and he looked around,"
19185,"and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, twist-"
19186,"ing gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made"
19187,"for her, a starry, transparent sphere somewhere between glittering"
19188,cage and tank.
19189,"With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes; at the same"
19190,"moment his ears were assaulted with the screeches and cries, the"
19191,smashes and bangs of battle.
19192,"“He’s in the Shrieking Shack. The snake’s with him, it’s got some"
19193,sort of magical protection around it. He’s just sent Lucius Malfoy
19194,to find Snape.”

19196,THE ELDER WAND
19197,"“Voldemort’s sitting in the Shrieking Shack?” said Hermione,"
19198,outraged. “He’s not — he’s not even fighting?”
19199,"“He doesn’t think he needs to fight,” said Harry. “He thinks I’m"
19200,going to go to him.”
19201,“But why?”
19202,“He knows I’m after Horcruxes — he’s keeping Nagini close be-
19203,side him — obviously I’m going to have to go to him to get near
19204,the thing —”
19205,"“Right,” said Ron, squaring his shoulders. “So you can’t go, that’s"
19206,"what he wants, what he’s expecting. You stay here and look after"
19207,"Hermione, and I’ll go and get it —”"
19208,Harry cut across Ron.
19209,"“You two stay here, I’ll go under the Cloak and I’ll be back as"
19210,soon as I —”
19211,"“No,” said Hermione, “it makes much more sense if I take the"
19212,Cloak and —”
19213,"“Don’t even think about it,” Ron snarled at her."
19214,"Before Hermione could get farther than “Ron, I’m just as capa-"
19215,ble —” the tapestry at the top of the staircase on which they stood
19216,was ripped open.
19217,“POTTER!”
19218,"Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their"
19219,"wands were fully raised, Hermione shouted, “Glisseo!”"
19220,"The stairs beneath their feet flattened into a chute and she, Harry,"
19221,"and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast"
19222,that the Death Eaters’ Stunning Spells flew far over their heads.
19223,They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom and spun
19224,"onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall."
19225,"“Duro!” cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and"
19226,  643   
19227,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19228,"there were two loud, sickening crunches as the tapestry turned to"
19229,stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it.
19230,"“Get back!” shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione flat-"
19231,tened themselves against a door as a herd of galloping desks thun-
19232,"dered past, shepherded by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She"
19233,appeared not to notice them: Her hair had come down and there
19234,"was a gash on her cheek. As she turned the corner, they heard her"
19235,"scream, “CHARGE!”"
19236,"“Harry, you get the Cloak on,” said Hermione. “Never mind"
19237,us —”
19238,"But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were, he"
19239,doubted anyone would see their disembodied feet through the dust
19240,"that clogged the air, the falling stone, the shimmer of spells."
19241,They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a cor-
19242,ridor full of duelers. The portraits on either side of the fighters were
19243,"crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, while"
19244,"Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and"
19245,"teachers. Dean had won himself a wand, for he was face-to-face"
19246,"with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron, and Hermione"
19247,"raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were"
19248,weaving and darting around so much that there was a strong likeli-
19249,hood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as
19250,"they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a"
19251,"great “Wheeeeeeeeeeee!” and, looking up, Harry saw Peeves zooming"
19252,"over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters,"
19253,whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like
19254,fat worms.
19255,“Argh!”
19256,A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron’s head; the slimy
19257, 644  
19258,THE ELDER WAND
19259,green roots were suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to
19260,shake them loose.
19261,"“Someone’s invisible there!” shouted a masked Death Eater,"
19262,pointing.
19263,Dean made the most of the Death Eater’s momentary distrac-
19264,"tion, knocking him out with a Stunning Spell; Dolohov attempted"
19265,to retaliate and Parvati shot a Body-Bind Curse at him.
19266,"“LET’S GO!” Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gath-"
19267,"ered the Cloak tightly around themselves and pelted, heads down,"
19268,"through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of Snar-"
19269,"galuff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance"
19270,hall.
19271,"“I’m Draco Malfoy, I’m Draco, I’m on your side!”"
19272,"Draco was on the upper landing, pleading with another masked"
19273,Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed: Mal-
19274,"foy looked around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him"
19275,from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell backward on top of the Death
19276,"Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused."
19277,"“And that’s the second time we’ve saved your life tonight, you"
19278,two-faced bastard!” Ron yelled.
19279,"There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death"
19280,"Eaters everywhere Harry looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors,"
19281,"in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling Kingsley"
19282,"right beside them. Students ran in every direction, some carrying or"
19283,dragging injured friends. Harry directed a Stunning Spell toward
19284,"the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit Neville, who had"
19285,emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentac-
19286,"ula, which looped itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and"
19287,began reeling him in.
19288, 645  
19289,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19290,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase: Glass"
19291,"shattered to their left, and the Slytherin hourglass that had recorded"
19292,"House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people slipped"
19293,and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony over-
19294,"head as they reached the ground, and a gray blur that Harry took"
19295,for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its teeth into
19296,one of the fallen.
19297,"“NO!” shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her"
19298,"wand, Fenrir Greyback was thrown backward from the feebly stir-"
19299,ring body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters and
19300,"struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and"
19301,"a crack, a crystal ball fell on top of his head, and he crumpled to"
19302,the ground and did not move.
19303,“I have more!” shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the ban-
19304,isters. “More for any who want them! Here —”
19305,"And with a movement like a tennis serve, she heaved another"
19306,"enormous crystal sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the"
19307,"air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall and smash through"
19308,"a window. At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors"
19309,"burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders forced their way into"
19310,the entrance hall.
19311,"Screams of terror rent the air: The fighters scattered, Death Eat-"
19312,"ers and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into"
19313,"the midst of the oncoming monsters, which shuddered and reared,"
19314,more terrifying than ever.
19315,"“How do we get out?” yelled Ron over all the screaming, but"
19316,before either Harry or Hermione could answer they were bowled
19317,"aside: Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing"
19318,his flowery pink umbrella.
19319, 646  
19320,THE ELDER WAND
19321,"“Don’t hurt ’em, don’t hurt ’em!” he yelled."
19322,"“HAGRID, NO!”"
19323,Harry forgot everything else: He sprinted out from under the
19324,"Cloak, running bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the"
19325,whole hall.
19326,"“HAGRID, COME BACK!”"
19327,But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen:
19328,"Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying,"
19329,"a foul swarming movement, they retreated under the onslaught of"
19330,"spells, Hagrid buried in their midst."
19331,“HAGRID!”
19332,"Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or"
19333,foe he did not care: He was sprinting down the front steps into the
19334,"dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with their prey,"
19335,and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all.
19336,“HAGRID!”
19337,He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from
19338,"the midst of the spider swarm, but as he made to chase after them,"
19339,"his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down"
19340,out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shud-
19341,"der. He looked up: A giant stood before him, twenty feet high,"
19342,"its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its treelike, hairy shins"
19343,"illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid"
19344,"movement, it smashed a massive fist through an upper window, and"
19345,"glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the shelter"
19346,of the doorway.
19347,"“Oh my — !” shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with"
19348,Harry and gazed upward at the giant now trying to seize people
19349,through the window above.
19350, 647   
19351,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19352,"“DON’T!” Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione’s hand as she raised"
19353,her wand. “Stun him and he’ll crush half the castle —”
19354,“HAGGER?”
19355,Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now
19356,"did Harry realize that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant."
19357,The gargantuan monster trying to crush people on the upper floors
19358,looked around and let out a roar. The stone steps trembled as he
19359,"stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp’s lopsided mouth fell"
19360,"open, showing yellow, half-brick-sized teeth; and then they launched"
19361,themselves at each other with the savagery of lions.
19362,“RUN!” Harry roared; the night was full of hideous yells and blows
19363,"as the giants wrestled, and he seized Hermione’s hand and tore down"
19364,"the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. Harry had not"
19365,lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were
19366,halfway toward the forest before they were brought up short again.
19367,The air around them had frozen: Harry’s breath caught and so-
19368,"lidified in his chest. Shapes moved out in the darkness, swirling"
19369,"figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave toward"
19370,"the castle, their faces hooded and their breath rattling. . . ."
19371,Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting
19372,"behind them grew suddenly muted, deadened, because a silence only"
19373,"dementors could bring was falling thickly through the night, and"
19374,"Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead. . . ."
19375,"“Come on, Harry!” said Hermione’s voice from a very long way"
19376,"away. “Patronuses, Harry, come on!”"
19377,"He raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading through"
19378,him: How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about; he
19379,felt as though his soul had already half left his body. . . .
19380,"“HARRY, COME ON!” screamed Hermione."
19381,  648  
19382,THE ELDER WAND
19383,"A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them,"
19384,"sucking their way closer to Harry’s despair, which was like a prom-"
19385,ise of a feast. . . .
19386,"He saw Ron’s silver terrier burst into the air, flicker feebly, and ex-"
19387,pire; he saw Hermione’s otter twist in midair and fade; and his own
19388,"wand trembled in his hand, and he almost welcomed the oncoming"
19389,"oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling. . . ."
19390,"And then a silver hare, a boar, and a fox soared past Harry, Ron,"
19391,and Hermione’s heads: The dementors fell back before the crea-
19392,tures’ approach. Three more people had arrived out of the darkness
19393,"to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast"
19394,"their Patronuses: Luna, Ernie, and Seamus."
19395,"“That’s right,” said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in"
19396,the Room of Requirement and this was simply spell practice for
19397,"the D.A. “That’s right, Harry . . . come on, think of something"
19398,happy. . . .”
19399,"“Something happy?” he said, his voice cracked."
19400,"“We’re all still here,” she whispered, “we’re still fighting. Come"
19401,"on, now. . . .”"
19402,"There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with"
19403,"the greatest effort it had ever cost him, the stag burst from the end"
19404,"of Harry’s wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors scat-"
19405,"tered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the"
19406,sounds of the surrounding battle were loud in his ears.
19407,"“Can’t thank you enough,” said Ron shakily, turning to Luna,"
19408,"Ernie, and Seamus, “you just saved —”"
19409,"With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came"
19410,"lurching out of the darkness from the direction of the forest, bran-"
19411,dishing a club taller than any of them.
19412, 649   
19413,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19414,"“RUN!” Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling:"
19415,"They all scattered, and not a second too soon, for next moment the"
19416,creature’s vast foot had fallen exactly where they had been standing.
19417,"Harry looked round: Ron and Hermione were following him, but"
19418,the other three had vanished back into the battle.
19419,“Let’s get out of range!” yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again
19420,"and its bellows echoed through the night, across the grounds where"
19421,bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate the darkness.
19422,"“The Whomping Willow,” said Harry, “go!”"
19423,"Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a"
19424,small space into which he could not look now: Thoughts of Fred
19425,"and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in"
19426,"and outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had"
19427,"to reach the snake and Voldemort, because that was, as Hermione"
19428,"said, the only way to end it —"
19429,"He sprinted, half believing he could outdistance death itself, ig-"
19430,"noring the jets of light flying in the darkness all around him, and"
19431,"the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the"
19432,Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds
19433,"that seemed themselves to have risen in rebellion, he ran faster than"
19434,"he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great tree"
19435,"first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike,"
19436,slashing branches.
19437,"Panting and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the Willow’s"
19438,"swiping branches, peering through the darkness toward its thick"
19439,"trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that"
19440,"would paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out"
19441,of breath she could not speak.
19442, 650  
19443,THE ELDER WAND
19444,“How — how’re we going to get in?” panted Ron. “I can — see
19445,the place — if we just had — Crookshanks again —”
19446,"“Crookshanks?” wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her"
19447,"chest. “Are you a wizard, or what?”"
19448,“Oh — right — yeah —”
19449,"Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the"
19450,"ground and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!” The twig flew up from"
19451,"the ground, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind,"
19452,then zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow’s ominously
19453,"swaying branches. It jabbed at a place near the roots, and at once,"
19454,the writhing tree became still.
19455,“Perfect!” panted Hermione.
19456,“Wait.”
19457,"For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the"
19458,"battle filled the air, Harry hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do"
19459,"this, wanted him to come. . . . Was he leading Ron and Hermione"
19460,into a trap?
19461,"But then the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain:"
19462,"The only way forward was to kill the snake, and the snake was where"
19463,"Voldemort was, and Voldemort was at the end of this tunnel. . . ."
19464,"“Harry, we’re coming, just get in there!” said Ron, pushing him"
19465,forward.
19466,Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree’s roots.
19467,It was a much tighter squeeze than it had been the last time they had
19468,entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged: They had had to double
19469,up to move through it nearly four years previously; now there was
19470,"nothing for it but to crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated,"
19471,"expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none came. They"
19472,  651  
19473,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19474,"moved in silence, Harry’s gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of"
19475,the wand held in his fist.
19476,At last the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver
19477,of light ahead. Hermione tugged at his ankle.
19478,“The Cloak!” she whispered. “Put the Cloak on!”
19479,He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery
19480,"cloth into his free hand. With difficulty he dragged it over himself,"
19481,"murmured, “Nox,” extinguishing his wandlight, and continued on"
19482,"his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining,"
19483,"expecting every second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice,"
19484,see a flash of green light.
19485,And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of
19486,"them, only slightly muffled by the fact that the opening at the end"
19487,of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old crate.
19488,"Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and"
19489,peered through a tiny gap left between crate and wall.
19490,"The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirling"
19491,"and coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry"
19492,"sphere, which floated unsupported in midair. He could see the edge"
19493,"of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. Then"
19494,"Snape spoke, and Harry’s heart lurched: Snape was inches away from"
19495,"where he crouched, hidden."
19496,"“. . . my Lord, their resistance is crumbling —”"
19497,"“— and it is doing so without your help,” said Voldemort in his"
19498,"high, clear voice. “Skilled wizard though you are, Severus, I do not"
19499,think you will make much difference now. We are almost there . . .
19500,almost.”
19501,“Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find
19502,"him, my Lord. Please.”"
19503, 652   
19504,THE ELDER WAND
19505,"Snape strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping"
19506,"his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering whether there was any spell"
19507,"that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could"
19508,"not think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away"
19509,his position. . . .
19510,"Voldemort stood up. Harry could see him now, see the red eyes,"
19511,"the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him gleaming slightly"
19512,in the semidarkness.
19513,"“I have a problem, Severus,” said Voldemort softly."
19514,“My Lord?” said Snape.
19515,"Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and"
19516,precisely as a conductor’s baton.
19517,"“Why doesn’t it work for me, Severus?”"
19518,In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing
19519,slightly as it coiled and uncoiled — or was it Voldemort’s sibilant
19520,sigh lingering on the air?
19521,“My — my Lord?” said Snape blankly. “I do not understand.
19522,You — you have performed extraordinary magic with that wand.”
19523,"“No,” said Voldemort. “I have performed my usual magic. I am"
19524,"extraordinary, but this wand . . . no. It has not revealed the wonders"
19525,it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one
19526,I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.”
19527,"Voldemort’s tone was musing, calm, but Harry’s scar had begun"
19528,"to throb and pulse: Pain was building in his forehead, and he could"
19529,feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort.
19530,"“No difference,” said Voldemort again."
19531,Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face: He wondered
19532,"whether Snape sensed danger, was trying to find the right words to"
19533,reassure his master.
19534, 653   
19535,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19536,Voldemort started to move around the room: Harry lost sight
19537,"of him for seconds as he prowled, speaking in that same measured"
19538,"voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry."
19539,"“I have thought long and hard, Severus. . . . Do you know why"
19540,I have called you back from the battle?”
19541,And for a moment Harry saw Snape’s profile: His eyes were fixed
19542,upon the coiling snake in its enchanted cage.
19543,"“No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find"
19544,Potter.”
19545,“You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I
19546,do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I know his
19547,"weakness, you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the"
19548,"others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it"
19549,happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.”
19550,"“But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by one other than"
19551,yourself —”
19552,“My instructions to my Death Eaters have been perfectly clear.
19553,"Capture Potter. Kill his friends — the more, the better — but do"
19554,not kill him.
19555,"“But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry Potter."
19556,You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable.”
19557,“My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But — let me go
19558,"and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I"
19559,can —”
19560,"“I have told you, no!” said Voldemort, and Harry caught the glint"
19561,"of red in his eyes as he turned again, and the swishing of his cloak"
19562,"was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort’s impatience"
19563,"in his burning scar. “My concern at the moment, Severus, is what"
19564,will happen when I finally meet the boy!”
19565, 654   
19566,THE ELDER WAND
19567,"“My Lord, there can be no question, surely — ?”"
19568,"“— but there is a question, Severus. There is.”"
19569,"Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly again as he"
19570,"slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape."
19571,“Why did both the wands I have used fail when directed at Harry
19572,Potter?”
19573,"“I — I cannot answer that, my Lord.”"
19574,“Can’t you?”
19575,The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry’s head: He
19576,forced his own fist into his mouth to stop himself from crying out
19577,"in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was Voldemort, look-"
19578,ing into Snape’s pale face.
19579,"“My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus,"
19580,except to kill Harry Potter. Twice it failed. Ollivander told me under
19581,"torture of the twin cores, told me to take another’s wand. I did so,"
19582,but Lucius’s wand shattered upon meeting Potter’s.”
19583,"“I — I have no explanation, my Lord.”"
19584,Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes were still
19585,fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere.
19586,"“I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of"
19587,"Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it from its previous master. I took it"
19588,from the grave of Albus Dumbledore.”
19589,"And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape’s face was like a"
19590,"death mask. It was marble white and so still that when he spoke, it"
19591,was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank eyes.
19592,“My Lord — let me go to the boy —”
19593,"“All this long night, when I am on the brink of victory, I have"
19594,"sat here,” said Voldemort, his voice barely louder than a whisper,"
19595,"“wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be what it"
19596, 655   
19597,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19598,"ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for"
19599,its rightful owner . . . and I think I have the answer.”
19600,Snape did not speak.
19601,"“Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all,"
19602,"Severus. You have been a good and faithful servant, and I regret"
19603,what must happen.”
19604,“My Lord —”
19605,"“The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I"
19606,am not its true master. The Elder Wand belongs to the wizard who
19607,"killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you live,"
19608,"Severus, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine.”"
19609,"“My Lord!” Snape protested, raising his wand."
19610,"“It cannot be any other way,” said Voldemort. “I must master the"
19611,"wand, Severus. Master the wand, and I master Potter at last.”"
19612,And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did noth-
19613,"ing to Snape, who for a split second seemed to think he had been"
19614,reprieved: But then Voldemort’s intention became clear. The snake’s
19615,"cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do any-"
19616,"thing more than yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and"
19617,Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue.
19618,“Kill.”
19619,There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape’s face losing the
19620,"little color it had left; it whitened as his black eyes widened, as the"
19621,"snake’s fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted"
19622,"cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor."
19623,"“I regret it,” said Voldemort coldly."
19624,"He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was"
19625,"time to leave this shack and take charge, with a wand that would"
19626, 656  
19627,THE ELDER WAND
19628,now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage holding the
19629,"snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the"
19630,"floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept"
19631,"from the room without a backward glance, and the great serpent"
19632,floated after him in its huge protective sphere.
19633,"Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes: He"
19634,had drawn blood biting down on his knuckles in the effort not to
19635,shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between crate
19636,"and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor."
19637,"“Harry!” breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already"
19638,pointed his wand at the crate blocking his view. It lifted an inch
19639,"into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, he"
19640,pulled himself up into the room.
19641,"He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching"
19642,the dying man: He did not know what he felt as he saw Snape’s
19643,"white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at"
19644,his neck. Harry took off the Invisibility Cloak and looked down
19645,"upon the man he hated, whose widening black eyes found Harry as"
19646,"he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the front"
19647,of his robes and pulled him close.
19648,"A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape’s throat."
19649,“Take . . . it. . . . Take . . . it. . . .”
19650,Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery
19651,"blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed from his mouth and his ears"
19652,"and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know what"
19653,to do —
19654,"A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hands"
19655,by Hermione. Harry lifted the silvery substance into it with his
19656,  657     
19657,CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO
19658,"wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as"
19659,"though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry’s robes"
19660,slackened.
19661,“Look . . . at . . . me. . . .” he whispered.
19662,"The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in"
19663,"the depths of the dark pair seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed,"
19664,"blank, and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor,"
19665,and Snape moved no more.
19666, 658 
19667,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19668,THE PRINCE’S TALE
19669,"H           arry remained kneeling at Snape’s side, simply staring"
19670,"down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold voice spoke"
19671,"so close to them that Harry jumped to his feet, the flask gripped tightly"
19672,"in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had reentered the room."
19673,"Voldemort’s voice reverberated from the walls and floor, and"
19674,Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the sur-
19675,"rounding area, that the residents of Hogsmeade and all those still"
19676,fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he stood beside
19677,"them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow away."
19678,"“You have fought,” said the high, cold voice, “valiantly. Lord Vol-"
19679,demort knows how to value bravery.
19680,"“Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me,"
19681,"you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop"
19682,of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.
19683,“Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat
19684,immediately.

19686,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19687,“You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat
19688,your injured.
19689,"“I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted"
19690,your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait
19691,"for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that hour,"
19692,"you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle"
19693,"recommences. This time, I shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter,"
19694,"and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, woman, and"
19695,child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.”
19696,"Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking"
19697,at Harry.
19698,"“Don’t listen to him,” said Ron."
19699,"“It’ll be all right,” said Hermione wildly. “Let’s — let’s get back"
19700,"to the castle, if he’s gone to the forest we’ll need to think of a new"
19701,plan —”
19702,"She glanced at Snape’s body, then hurried back to the tunnel en-"
19703,"trance. Ron followed her. Harry gathered up the Invisibility Cloak,"
19704,"then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, except"
19705,"shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which"
19706,it had been done. . . .
19707,"They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking,"
19708,and Harry wondered whether Ron and Hermione could still hear
19709,"Voldemort ringing in their heads, as he could."
19710,You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me
19711,yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. . . . One
19712,hour. . . .
19713,Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle.
19714,"It could only be an hour or so from dawn, yet it was pitch-black."
19715,"The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog, the"
19716, 660  
19717,THE PRINCE’S TALE
19718,"size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no"
19719,other sign of Grawp or of his attacker.
19720,The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light
19721,"now, no bangs or screams or shouts. The flagstones of the deserted"
19722,entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still scattered
19723,"all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood."
19724,Part of the banisters had been blown away.
19725,“Where is everyone?” whispered Hermione.
19726,Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the
19727,doorway.
19728,The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The
19729,"survivors stood in groups, their arms around each other’s necks."
19730,The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by Madam
19731,Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his
19732,"flank poured blood and he shook where he lay, unable to stand."
19733,The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not
19734,"see Fred’s body, because his family surrounded him. George was"
19735,"kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred’s chest, her"
19736,"body shaking, Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded"
19737,down his cheeks.
19738,"Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away."
19739,"Harry saw Hermione approach Ginny, whose face was swollen and"
19740,"blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who flung an"
19741,arm around Ron’s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer
19742,"to the rest of the family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying"
19743,"next to Fred: Remus and Tonks, pale and still and peaceful-looking,"
19744,"apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling."
19745,"The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink,"
19746,as Harry reeled backward from the doorway. He could not draw
19747, 661   
19748,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19749,"breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see"
19750,"who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys,"
19751,"could not look into their eyes, when if he had given himself up in"
19752,"the first place, Fred might never have died. . . ."
19753,"He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks . . ."
19754,"He yearned not to feel. . . . He wished he could rip out his heart, his"
19755,"innards, everything that was screaming inside him. . . ."
19756,The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have
19757,joined the mass mourning in the Great Hall. Harry ran without
19758,"stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape’s last thoughts, and"
19759,he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding
19760,the headmaster’s office.
19761,“Password?”
19762,"“Dumbledore!” said Harry without thinking, because it was he"
19763,"whom he yearned to see, and to his surprise the gargoyle slid aside,"
19764,revealing the spiral staircase behind.
19765,But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change.
19766,The portraits that hung all around the walls were empty. Not a single
19767,"headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it seemed, had"
19768,"flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle, so"
19769,that they could have a clear view of what was going on.
19770,"Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore’s deserted frame, which"
19771,"hung directly behind the headmaster’s chair, then turned his back"
19772,on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had always been:
19773,Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape’s memories into
19774,the wide basin with its runic markings around the edge. To escape
19775,into someone else’s head would be a blessed relief. . . . Nothing that
19776,even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The
19777,"memories swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating,"
19778, 662  
19779,THE PRINCE’S TALE
19780,"with a feeling of reckless abandonment, as though this would as-"
19781,"suage his torturing grief, Harry dived."
19782,"He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground."
19783,"When he straightened up, he saw that he was in a nearly deserted"
19784,playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant skyline.
19785,"Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy"
19786,was watching them from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair
19787,was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched that it looked
19788,"deliberate: too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have"
19789,"belonged to a grown man, an odd smocklike shirt."
19790,Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine
19791,"or ten years old, sallow, small, stringy. There was undisguised greed"
19792,in his thin face as he watched the younger of the two girls swinging
19793,higher and higher than her sister.
19794,"“Lily, don’t do it!” shrieked the elder of the two."
19795,But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc
19796,"and flown into the air, quite literally flown, launched herself sky-"
19797,"ward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling on"
19798,"the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze artist through the"
19799,"air, staying up far too long, landing far too lightly."
19800,“Mummy told you not to!”
19801,Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals
19802,"on the ground, making a crunching, grinding sound, then leapt"
19803,"up, hands on hips."
19804,"“Mummy said you weren’t allowed, Lily!”"
19805,"“But I’m fine,” said Lily, still giggling. “Tuney, look at this. Watch"
19806,what I can do.”
19807,Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from
19808,"themselves and, though the girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had"
19809,  663   
19810,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19811,picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape lurked.
19812,"Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval."
19813,"Lily waited until Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then"
19814,"held out her palm. The flower sat there, opening and closing its pet-"
19815,"als, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster."
19816,“Stop it!” shrieked Petunia.
19817,"“It’s not hurting you,” said Lily, but she closed her hand on the"
19818,blossom and threw it back to the ground.
19819,"“It’s not right,” said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower’s"
19820,flight to the ground and lingered upon it. “How do you do it?” she
19821,"added, and there was definite longing in her voice."
19822,"“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” Snape could no longer contain himself,"
19823,but had jumped out from behind the bushes. Petunia shrieked and
19824,"ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled,"
19825,remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance.
19826,A dull flush of color mounted the sallow cheeks as he looked at
19827,Lily.
19828,“What’s obvious?” asked Lily.
19829,Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the dis-
19830,"tant Petunia, now hovering beside the swings, he lowered his voice"
19831,"and said, “I know what you are.”"
19832,“What do you mean?”
19833,"“You’re . . . you’re a witch,” whispered Snape."
19834,She looked affronted.
19835,“That’s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!”
19836,"She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister."
19837,"“No!” said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry won-"
19838,"dered why he did not take off the ridiculously large coat, unless it"
19839,was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He
19840,  664  
19841,THE PRINCE’S TALE
19842,"flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously batlike, like his older"
19843,self.
19844,"The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding"
19845,on to one of the swing poles as though it was the safe place in tag.
19846,"“You are,” said Snape to Lily. “You are a witch. I’ve been watch-"
19847,ing you for a while. But there’s nothing wrong with that. My mum’s
19848,"one, and I’m a wizard.”"
19849,Petunia’s laugh was like cold water.
19850,"“Wizard!” she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had"
19851,recovered from the shock of his unexpected appearance. “I know
19852,who you are. You’re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner’s End
19853,"by the river,” she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that"
19854,she considered the address a poor recommendation. “Why have you
19855,been spying on us?”
19856,"“Haven’t been spying,” said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and"
19857,"dirty-haired in the bright sunlight. “Wouldn’t spy on you, anyway,”"
19858,"he added spitefully, “you’re a Muggle.”"
19859,"Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could"
19860,hardly mistake the tone.
19861,"“Lily, come on, we’re leaving!” she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her"
19862,"sister at once, glaring at Snape as she left. He stood watching them"
19863,"as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the only"
19864,"one left to observe him, recognized Snape’s bitter disappointment,"
19865,and understood that Snape had been planning this moment for a
19866,"while, and that it had all gone wrong. . . ."
19867,"The scene dissolved, and before Harry knew it, re-formed around"
19868,him. He was now in a small thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit
19869,river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the trees
19870,"made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other,"
19871, 665   
19872,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19873,cross-legged on the ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his
19874,odd smock looked less peculiar in the half light.
19875,“. . . and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside
19876,"school, you get letters.”"
19877,“But I have done magic outside school!”
19878,“We’re all right. We haven’t got wands yet. They let you off when
19879,"you’re a kid and you can’t help it. But once you’re eleven,” he nod-"
19880,"ded importantly, “and they start training you, then you’ve got to"
19881,go careful.”
19882,There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and
19883,"twirled it in the air, and Harry knew that she was imagining sparks"
19884,"trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward the"
19885,"boy, and said, “It is real, isn’t it? It’s not a joke? Petunia says you’re"
19886,"lying to me. Petunia says there isn’t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn’t"
19887,it?”
19888,"“It’s real for us,” said Snape. “Not for her. But we’ll get the letter,"
19889,you and me.”
19890,“Really?” whispered Lily.
19891,"“Definitely,” said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and"
19892,"his odd clothes, he struck an oddly impressive figure sprawled in"
19893,"front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny."
19894,“And will it really come by owl?” Lily whispered.
19895,"“Normally,” said Snape. “But you’re Muggle-born, so someone"
19896,from the school will have to come and explain to your parents.”
19897,"“Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?”"
19898,"Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom,"
19899,"moved over the pale face, the dark red hair."
19900,"“No,” he said. “It doesn’t make any difference.”"

19903,"“Good,” said Lily, relaxing: It was clear that she had been"
19904,worrying.
19905,"“You’ve got loads of magic,” said Snape. “I saw that. All the time"
19906,I was watching you . . .”
19907,"His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched"
19908,out on the leafy ground and was looking up at the canopy of leaves
19909,overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in the
19910,playground.
19911,“How are things at your house?” Lily asked.
19912,A little crease appeared between his eyes.
19913,"“Fine,” he said."
19914,“They’re not arguing anymore?”
19915,"“Oh yes, they’re arguing,” said Snape. He picked up a fistful of"
19916,"leaves and began tearing them apart, apparently unaware of what"
19917,he was doing. “But it won’t be that long and I’ll be gone.”
19918,“Doesn’t your dad like magic?”
19919,"“He doesn’t like anything, much,” said Snape."
19920,“Severus?”
19921,A little smile twisted Snape’s mouth when she said his name.
19922,“Yeah?”
19923,“Tell me about the dementors again.”
19924,“What d’you want to know about them for?”
19925,“If I use magic outside school —”
19926,“They wouldn’t give you to the dementors for that! Demen-
19927,tors are for people who do really bad stuff. They guard the wizard
19928,"prison, Azkaban. You’re not going to end up in Azkaban, you’re"
19929,too —”
19930,He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small
19931, 667 
19932,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19933,"rustling noise behind Harry made him turn: Petunia, hiding behind"
19934,"a tree, had lost her footing."
19935,"“Tuney!” said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape"
19936,had jumped to his feet.
19937,“Who’s spying now?” he shouted. “What d’you want?”
19938,"Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see"
19939,her struggling for something hurtful to say.
19940,"“What is that you’re wearing, anyway?” she said, pointing at"
19941,Snape’s chest. “Your mum’s blouse?”
19942,There was a crack: A branch over Petunia’s head had fallen. Lily
19943,"screamed: The branch caught Petunia on the shoulder, and she stag-"
19944,gered backward and burst into tears.
19945,“Tuney!”
19946,But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape.
19947,“Did you make that happen?”
19948,“No.” He looked both defiant and scared.
19949,“You did!” She was backing away from him. “You did ! You hurt
19950,her!”
19951,“No — no I didn’t!”
19952,"But the lie did not convince Lily: After one last burning look,"
19953,"she ran from the little thicket, off after her sister, and Snape looked"
19954,miserable and confused. . . .
19955,And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around: He was on plat-
19956,"form nine and three-quarters, and Snape stood beside him, slightly"
19957,"hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who"
19958,greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short
19959,distance away. The two girls stood a little apart from their parents.
19960,Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister; Harry moved closer to
19961,listen.
19962,  668   
19963,THE PRINCE’S TALE
19964,"“. . . I’m sorry, Tuney, I’m sorry! Listen —” She caught her sister’s"
19965,"hand and held tight to it, even though Petunia tried to pull it away."
19966,"“Maybe once I’m there — no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I’m there,"
19967,I’ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to
19968,change his mind!”
19969,"“I don’t — want — to — go!” said Petunia, and she dragged her"
19970,hand back out of her sister’s grasp. “You think I want to go to some
19971,stupid castle and learn to be a — a —”
19972,"Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewling in"
19973,"their owners’ arms, over the owls fluttering and hooting at each"
19974,"other in cages, over the students, some already in their long black"
19975,"robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting"
19976,one another with glad cries after a summer apart.
19977,“— you think I want to be a — a freak?”
19978,Lily’s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her
19979,hand away.
19980,"“I’m not a freak,” said Lily. “That’s a horrible thing to say.”"
19981,"“That’s where you’re going,” said Petunia with relish. “A special"
19982,"school for freaks. You and that Snape boy . . . weirdos, that’s what"
19983,you two are. It’s good you’re being separated from normal people.
19984,It’s for our safety.”
19985,"Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the"
19986,"platform with an air of wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the"
19987,"scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice was low and"
19988,fierce.
19989,“You didn’t think it was such a freak’s school when you wrote to
19990,the headmaster and begged him to take you.”
19991,Petunia turned scarlet.
19992,“Beg? I didn’t beg!”
19993, 669   
19994,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
19995,“I saw his reply. It was very kind.”
19996,"“You shouldn’t have read —” whispered Petunia, “that was my"
19997,private — how could you — ?”
19998,Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood
19999,nearby. Petunia gasped.
20000,“That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my
20001,room!”
20002,“No — not sneaking —” Now Lily was on the defensive. “Severus
20003,"saw the envelope, and he couldn’t believe a Muggle could have con-"
20004,"tacted Hogwarts, that’s all! He says there must be wizards working"
20005,undercover in the postal service who take care of —”
20006,"“Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!” said Petunia,"
20007,"now as pale as she had been flushed. “Freak!” she spat at her sister,"
20008,and she flounced off to where her parents stood. . . .
20009,The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor
20010,of the Hogwarts Express as it clattered through the countryside. He
20011,"had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken the"
20012,first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he
20013,"stopped, outside a compartment in which a group of rowdy boys"
20014,"were talking. Hunched in a corner seat beside the window was Lily,"
20015,her face pressed against the windowpane.
20016,Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite
20017,Lily. She glanced at him and then looked back out of the window.
20018,She had been crying.
20019,"“I don’t want to talk to you,” she said in a constricted voice."
20020,“Why not?”
20021,“Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumble-
20022,dore.”
20023,“So what?”
20024, 670   
20025,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20026,She threw him a look of deep dislike.
20027,“So she’s my sister!”
20028,"“She’s only a —” He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying"
20029,"to wipe her eyes without being noticed, did not hear him."
20030,"“But we’re going!” he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in"
20031,his voice. “This is it! We’re off to Hogwarts!”
20032,"She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half"
20033,smiled.
20034,"“You’d better be in Slytherin,” said Snape, encouraged that she"
20035,had brightened a little.
20036,“Slytherin?”
20037,"One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no"
20038,"interest at all in Lily or Snape until that point, looked around at"
20039,"the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely on"
20040,"the two beside the window, saw his father: slight, black-haired like"
20041,"Snape, but with that indefinable air of having been well-cared-for,"
20042,"even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked."
20043,"“Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”"
20044,"James asked the boy lounging on the seats opposite him, and with"
20045,"a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile."
20046,"“My whole family have been in Slytherin,” he said."
20047,"“Blimey,” said James, “and I thought you seemed all right!”"
20048,Sirius grinned.
20049,"“Maybe I’ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you’ve"
20050,got the choice?”
20051,James lifted an invisible sword.
20052,"“ ‘Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!’ Like my dad.”"
20053,"Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him."
20054,“Got a problem with that?”
20055, 671   
20056,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
20057,"“No,” said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. “If you’d"
20058,rather be brawny than brainy —”
20059,"“Where’re you hoping to go, seeing as you’re neither?” interjected"
20060,Sirius.
20061,"James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked"
20062,from James to Sirius in dislike.
20063,"“Come on, Severus, let’s find another compartment.”"
20064,“Oooooo . . .”
20065,James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip
20066,Snape as he passed.
20067,"“See ya, Snivellus!” a voice called, as the compartment door"
20068,slammed. . . .
20069,And the scene dissolved once more. . . .
20070,Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit
20071,"House tables, lined with rapt faces. Then Professor McGonagall"
20072,"said, “Evans, Lily!”"
20073,He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit
20074,down upon the rickety stool. Professor McGonagall dropped the
20075,"Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had touched"
20076,"the dark red hair, the hat cried, “Gryffindor!”"
20077,"Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat,"
20078,"handed it back to Professor McGonagall, then hurried toward the"
20079,"cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at Snape, and"
20080,there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up
20081,"the bench to make room for her. She took one look at him, seemed"
20082,"to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, and firmly turned"
20083,her back on him.
20084,"The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and"
20085,"his father join Lily and Sirius at the Gryffindor table. At last, when"
20086, 672   
20087,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20088,"only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor McGonagall"
20089,called Snape.
20090,"Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat"
20091,upon his head. “Slytherin!” cried the Sorting Hat.
20092,"And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away"
20093,"from Lily, to where the Slytherins were cheering him, to where"
20094,"Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, patted"
20095,Snape on the back as he sat down beside him. . . .
20096,And the scene changed. . . .
20097,"Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently"
20098,"arguing. Harry hurried to catch up with them, to listen in. As he"
20099,"reached them, he realized how much taller they both were: A few"
20100,years seemed to have passed since their Sorting.
20101,“. . . thought we were supposed to be friends?” Snape was saying.
20102,“Best friends?”
20103,"“We are, Sev, but I don’t like some of the people you’re hanging"
20104,"round with! I’m sorry, but I detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber!"
20105,"What do you see in him, Sev, he’s creepy! D’you know what he tried"
20106,to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?”
20107,"Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into"
20108,"the thin, sallow face."
20109,"“That was nothing,” said Snape. “It was a laugh, that’s all —”"
20110,"“It was Dark Magic, and if you think that’s funny —”"
20111,“What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?” demanded
20112,"Snape. His color rose again as he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold"
20113,in his resentment.
20114,“What’s Potter got to do with anything?” said Lily.
20115,“They sneak out at night. There’s something weird about that
20116,Lupin. Where does he keep going?”
20117, 673   
20118,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
20119,"“He’s ill,” said Lily. “They say he’s ill —”"
20120,“Every month at the full moon?” said Snape.
20121,"“I know your theory,” said Lily, and she sounded cold. “Why are"
20122,you so obsessed with them anyway? Why do you care what they’re
20123,doing at night?”
20124,“I’m just trying to show you they’re not as wonderful as everyone
20125,seems to think they are.”
20126,The intensity of his gaze made her blush.
20127,"“They don’t use Dark Magic, though.” She dropped her voice."
20128,“And you’re being really ungrateful. I heard what happened the other
20129,night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Wil-
20130,"low, and James Potter saved you from whatever’s down there —”"
20131,"Snape’s whole face contorted and he spluttered, “Saved? Saved?"
20132,You think he was playing the hero? He was saving his neck and his
20133,friends’ too! You’re not going to — I won’t let you —”
20134,“Let me? Let me?”
20135,Lily’s bright green eyes were slits. Snape backtracked at once.
20136,“I didn’t mean — I just don’t want to see you made a fool of — He
20137,"fancies you, James Potter fancies you!” The words seemed wrenched"
20138,from him against his will. “And he’s not . . . everyone thinks . . .
20139,big Quidditch hero —” Snape’s bitterness and dislike were render-
20140,"ing him incoherent, and Lily’s eyebrows were traveling farther and"
20141,farther up her forehead.
20142,"“I know James Potter’s an arrogant toerag,” she said, cutting"
20143,across Snape. “I don’t need you to tell me that. But Mulciber’s and
20144,"Avery’s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don’t understand how"
20145,you can be friends with them.”
20146,Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures on Mul-
20147,"ciber and Avery. The moment she had insulted James Potter, his"
20148, 674     
20149,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20150,"whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there was a new"
20151,spring in Snape’s step. . . .
20152,And the scene dissolved. . . .
20153,Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his
20154,"O.W.L. in Defense Against the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered"
20155,away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the place be-
20156,"neath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat"
20157,"together. But Harry kept his distance this time, because he knew what"
20158,happened after James had hoisted Severus into the air and taunted
20159,"him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no plea-"
20160,sure to hear it again. . . . He watched as Lily joined the group and
20161,went to Snape’s defense. Distantly he heard Snape shout at her in his
20162,"humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word: “Mudblood.”"
20163,The scene changed. . . .
20164,“I’m sorry.”
20165,“I’m not interested.”
20166,“I’m sorry!”
20167,“Save your breath.”
20168,"It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood"
20169,"with her arms folded in front of the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the"
20170,entrance to Gryffindor Tower.
20171,“I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to
20172,sleep here.”
20173,"“I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood,"
20174,it just —”
20175,“Slipped out?” There was no pity in Lily’s voice. “It’s too late. I’ve
20176,made excuses for you for years. None of my friends can understand
20177,why I even talk to you. You and your precious little Death Eater

20181,"what you’re all aiming to be! You can’t wait to join You-Know-Who,"
20182,can you?”
20183,"He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking."
20184,"“I can’t pretend anymore. You’ve chosen your way, I’ve chosen"
20185,mine.”
20186,"“No — listen, I didn’t mean —”"
20187,“— to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth
20188,"Mudblood, Severus. Why should I be any different?”"
20189,"He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous"
20190,look she turned and climbed back through the portrait hole. . . .
20191,"The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to re-"
20192,form: Harry seemed to fly through shifting shapes and colors until
20193,"his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn"
20194,"and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches"
20195,"of a few leafless trees. The adult Snape was panting, turning on the"
20196,"spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something"
20197,"or for someone. . . . His fear infected Harry too, even though he"
20198,"knew that he could not be harmed, and he looked over his shoulder,"
20199,wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for —
20200,"Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air:"
20201,"Harry thought of lightning, but Snape had dropped to his knees"
20202,and his wand had flown out of his hand.
20203,“Don’t kill me!”
20204,“That was not my intention.”
20205,Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by
20206,the sound of the wind in the branches. He stood before Snape with
20207,"his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated from"
20208,below in the light cast by his wand.
20209, 676  
20210,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20211,"“Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for"
20212,me?”
20213,“No — no message — I’m here on my own account!”
20214,"Snape was wringing his hands: He looked a little mad, with his"
20215,straggling black hair flying around him.
20216,"“I — I come with a warning — no, a request — please —”"
20217,Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still
20218,"flew through the night air around them, silence fell on the spot"
20219,where he and Snape faced each other.
20220,“What request could a Death Eater make of me?”
20221,“The — the prophecy . . . the prediction . . . Trelawney . . .”
20222,"“Ah, yes,” said Dumbledore. “How much did you relay to Lord"
20223,Voldemort?”
20224,“Everything — everything I heard!” said Snape. “That is why —
20225,it is for that reason — he thinks it means Lily Evans!”
20226,"“The prophecy did not refer to a woman,” said Dumbledore. “It"
20227,spoke of a boy born at the end of July —”
20228,"“You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going"
20229,to hunt her down — kill them all —”
20230,"“If she means so much to you,” said Dumbledore, “surely Lord"
20231,Voldemort will spare her? Could you not ask for mercy for the
20232,"mother, in exchange for the son?”"
20233,“I have — I have asked him —”
20234,"“You disgust me,” said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard"
20235,so much contempt in his voice. Snape seemed to shrink a little. “You
20236,"do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? They"
20237,"can die, as long as you have what you want?”"
20238,"Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore."
20239, 677  
20240,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
20241,"“Hide them all, then,” he croaked. “Keep her — them — safe."
20242,Please.”
20243,"“And what will you give me in return, Severus?”"
20244,"“In — in return?” Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected"
20245,"him to protest, but after a long moment he said, “Anything.”"
20246,"The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore’s office, and"
20247,"something was making a terrible sound, like a wounded animal."
20248,Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was stand-
20249,"ing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised"
20250,"his face, and he looked like a man who had lived a hundred years"
20251,of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.
20252,“I thought . . . you were going . . . to keep her . . . safe. . . .”
20253,"“She and James put their faith in the wrong person,” said Dum-"
20254,"bledore. “Rather like you, Severus. Weren’t you hoping that Lord"
20255,Voldemort would spare her?”
20256,Snape’s breathing was shallow.
20257,"“Her boy survives,” said Dumbledore."
20258,"With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irk-"
20259,some fly.
20260,"“Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember"
20261,"the shape and color of Lily Evans’s eyes, I am sure?”"
20262,“DON’T!” bellowed Snape. “Gone . . . dead . . .”
20263,"“Is this remorse, Severus?”"
20264,“I wish . . . I wish I were dead. . . .”
20265,“And what use would that be to anyone?” said Dumbledore
20266,"coldly. “If you loved Lily Evans, if you truly loved her, then your"
20267,way forward is clear.”
20268,"Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore’s"

20278,"There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of him-"
20279,"self, mastered his own breathing. At last he said, “Very well. Very"
20280,"well. But never — never tell, Dumbledore! This must be between"
20281,us! Swear it! I cannot bear . . . especially Potter’s son . . . I want your
20282,word!”
20283,"“My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?”"
20284,"Dumbledore sighed, looking down into Snape’s ferocious, anguished"
20285,face. “If you insist . . .”
20286,The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing
20287,up and down in front of Dumbledore.
20288,"“— mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule-"
20289,"breaker, delighted to find himself famous, attention-seeking and"
20290,impertinent —”
20291,"“You see what you expect to see, Severus,” said Dumbledore, with-"
20292,out raising his eyes from a copy of Transfiguration Today. “Other
20293,"teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and reasonably tal-"
20294,"ented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.”"
20295,"Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, “Keep"
20296,"an eye on Quirrell, won’t you?”"
20297,"A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and"
20298,"Dumbledore stood a little apart in the entrance hall, while the last"
20299,stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed.
20300,“Well?” murmured Dumbledore.

20303,"“Karkaroff ’s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he"
20304,fears retribution; you know how much help he gave the Minis-
20305,try after the Dark Lord fell.” Snape looked sideways at Dumble-
20306,dore’s crooked-nosed profile. “Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark
20307,burns.”
20308,"“Does he?” said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger"
20309,Davies came giggling in from the grounds. “And are you tempted
20310,to join him?”
20311,"“No,” said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur’s and Roger’s retreating"
20312,figures. “I am not such a coward.”
20313,"“No,” agreed Dumbledore. “You are a braver man by far than Igor"
20314,"Karkaroff. You know, I sometimes think we Sort too soon. . . .”"
20315,"He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken. . . ."
20316,And now Harry stood in the headmaster’s office yet again. It
20317,"was nighttime, and Dumbledore sagged sideways in the thronelike"
20318,"chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand"
20319,"dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering"
20320,"incantations, pointing his wand at the wrist of the hand, while with"
20321,his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down
20322,"Dumbledore’s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore’s eyelids"
20323,fluttered and opened.
20324,"“Why,” said Snape, without preamble, “why did you put on"
20325,"that ring? It carries a curse, surely you realized that. Why even"
20326,touch it?”
20327,Marvolo Gaunt’s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was
20328,cracked; the sword of Gryffindor lay beside it.
20329,Dumbledore grimaced.
20330,“I . . . was a fool. Sorely tempted . . .”
20331,“Tempted by what?”

20333,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20334,Dumbledore did not answer.
20335,“It is a miracle you managed to return here!” Snape sounded fu-
20336,"rious. “That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power, to contain"
20337,it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for
20338,the time being —”
20339,"Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it"
20340,with the expression of one being shown an interesting curio.
20341,"“You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I"
20342,have?”
20343,Dumbledore’s tone was conversational; he might have been asking
20344,"for a weather forecast. Snape hesitated, and then said, “I cannot tell."
20345,Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell forever. It will spread
20346,"eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.”"
20347,Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live
20348,seemed a matter of little or no concern to him.
20349,"“I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.”"
20350,"“If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have"
20351,"been able to do more, buy you more time!” said Snape furiously."
20352,He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. “Did you think
20353,that breaking the ring would break the curse?”
20354,"“Something like that . . . I was delirious, no doubt. . . .” said"
20355,Dumbledore. With an effort he straightened himself in his chair.
20356,"“Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.”"
20357,Snape looked utterly perplexed. Dumbledore smiled.
20358,“I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His
20359,plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.”
20360,"Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across"
20361,the desk from Dumbledore. Harry could tell that he wanted to say
20362,"more on the subject of Dumbledore’s cursed hand, but the other"

20365,"held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. Scowling,"
20366,"Snape said, “The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This"
20367,is merely punishment for Lucius’s recent failures. Slow torture for
20368,"Draco’s parents, while they watch him fail and pay the price.”"
20369,"“In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him"
20370,"as surely as I have,” said Dumbledore. “Now, I should have thought"
20371,"the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is yourself?”"
20372,There was a short pause.
20373,"“That, I think, is the Dark Lord’s plan.”"
20374,“Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he
20375,will not need a spy at Hogwarts?”
20376,"“He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.”"
20377,"“And if it does fall into his grasp,” said Dumbledore, almost, it"
20378,"seemed, as an aside, “I have your word that you will do all in your"
20379,power to protect the students of Hogwarts?”
20380,Snape gave a stiff nod.
20381,“Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what
20382,Draco is up to. A frightened teenage boy is a danger to others as
20383,"well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to accept,"
20384,he likes you —”
20385,"“— much less since his father has lost favor. Draco blames me,"
20386,he thinks I have usurped Lucius’s position.”
20387,"“All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for acciden-"
20388,"tal victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately,"
20389,"of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him"
20390,from Lord Voldemort’s wrath.”
20391,"Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked,"
20392,“Are you intending to let him kill you?”
20393,“Certainly not. You must kill me.”

20396,"There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise."
20397,Fawkes the phoenix was gnawing a bit of cuttlebone.
20398,"“Would you like me to do it now?” asked Snape, his voice heavy"
20399,with irony. “Or would you like a few moments to compose an
20400,epitaph?”
20401,"“Oh, not quite yet,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “I daresay the"
20402,moment will present itself in due course. Given what has happened
20403,"tonight,” he indicated his withered hand, “we can be sure that it"
20404,will happen within a year.”
20405,"“If you don’t mind dying,” said Snape roughly, “why not let"
20406,Draco do it?”
20407,"“That boy’s soul is not yet so damaged,” said Dumbledore. “I"
20408,would not have it ripped apart on my account.”
20409,"“And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?”"
20410,“You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old
20411,"man avoid pain and humiliation,” said Dumbledore. “I ask this one"
20412,"great favor of you, Severus, because death is coming for me as surely"
20413,as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year’s league. I
20414,"confess I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and"
20415,"messy affair it will be if, for instance, Greyback is involved — I hear"
20416,"Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play"
20417,with her food before she eats it.”
20418,"His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had"
20419,"frequently pierced Harry, as though the soul they discussed was"
20420,visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod.
20421,Dumbledore seemed satisfied.
20422,"“Thank you, Severus . . .”"
20423,"The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were"
20424,strolling together in the deserted castle grounds by twilight.

20427,"“What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are clos-"

20429,Dumbledore looked weary.
20430,"“Why? You aren’t trying to give him more detentions, Severus?"
20431,The boy will soon have spent more time in detention than out.”
20432,“He is his father over again —”
20433,"“In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his"
20434,mother’s. I spend time with Harry because I have things to discuss
20435,"with him, information I must give him before it is too late.”"
20436,"“Information,” repeated Snape. “You trust him . . . you do not"
20437,trust me.”
20438,"“It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited"
20439,time. It is essential that I give the boy enough information for him
20440,to do what he needs to do.”
20441,“And why may I not have the same information?”
20442,"“I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly"
20443,not a basket that spends so much time dangling on the arm of Lord
20444,Voldemort.”
20445,“Which I do on your orders!”
20446,“And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underesti-
20447,"mate the constant danger in which you place yourself, Severus."
20448,To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while
20449,withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but
20450,you.”
20451,“Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlu-
20452,"mency, whose magic is mediocre, and who has a direct connection"
20453,into the Dark Lord’s mind!”
20454,"“Voldemort fears that connection,” said Dumbledore. “Not so"
20455,long ago he had one small taste of what truly sharing Harry’s mind
20456,  684  
20457,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20458,means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He will
20459,"not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.”"
20460,“I don’t understand.”
20461,"“Lord Voldemort’s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact"
20462,"with a soul like Harry’s. Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in"
20463,flame —”
20464,“Souls? We were talking of minds!”
20465,"“In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to"
20466,speak of the other.”
20467,Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone.
20468,"They were close by the Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign"
20469,of anyone near them.
20470,"“After you have killed me, Severus —”"
20471,"“You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small ser-"
20472,"vice of me!” snarled Snape, and real anger flared in the thin face"
20473,"now. “You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I have"
20474,changed my mind!”
20475,"“You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about"
20476,"services you owe me, I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on"
20477,our young Slytherin friend?”
20478,"Snape looked angry, mutinous. Dumbledore sighed."
20479,"“Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not"
20480,complain that I have no confidence in you. . . .”
20481,"They were back in Dumbledore’s office, the windows dark, and"
20482,"Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat quite still, as Dumbledore walked"
20483,"around him, talking."
20484,"“Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it"
20485,"is necessary, otherwise how could he have the strength to do what"
20486,must be done?”
20487, 685   

20489,“But what must he do?”
20490,"“That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus."
20491,"There will come a time — after my death — do not argue, do not"
20492,interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem
20493,to fear for the life of his snake.”
20494,“For Nagini?” Snape looked astonished.
20495,“Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops send-
20496,"ing that snake forth to do his bidding, but keeps it safe beside him un-"
20497,"der magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell Harry.”"
20498,“Tell him what?”
20499,Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes.
20500,"“Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him,"
20501,"when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing"
20502,"Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Volde-"
20503,"mort’s soul was blasted apart from the whole, and latched itself onto"
20504,the only living soul left in that collapsing building. Part of Lord Vol-
20505,"demort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power"
20506,"of speech with snakes, and a connection with Lord Voldemort’s"
20507,mind that he has never understood. And while that fragment of
20508,"soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected"
20509,"by Harry, Lord Voldemort cannot die.”"
20510,Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a
20511,"long tunnel, they were so far away from him, their voices echoing"
20512,strangely in his ears.
20513,“So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly.
20514,"“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.”"
20515,"Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought . . . all these"
20516,years . . . that we were protecting him for her. For Lily.”

20518,THE PRINCE’S TALE
20519,“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach
20520,"him, to raise him, to let him try his strength,” said Dumbledore,"
20521,"his eyes still tight shut. “Meanwhile, the connection between them"
20522,"grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have thought"
20523,"he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters"
20524,"so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean"
20525,the end of Voldemort.”
20526,Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.
20527,“You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right mo-
20528,ment?”
20529,"“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have"
20530,you watched die?”
20531,"“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood"
20532,up. “You have used me.”
20533,“Meaning?”
20534,"“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal dan-"
20535,ger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s
20536,son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for
20537,slaughter —”
20538,"“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have"
20539,"you grown to care for the boy, after all?”"
20540,“For him?” shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!”
20541,From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe: She landed on the
20542,"office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out of the"
20543,"window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow"
20544,"faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears."
20545,“After all this time?”
20546,"“Always,” said Snape."
20547, 687   
20548,CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE
20549,"And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the"
20550,portrait of Dumbledore behind his desk.
20551,“You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry’s de-
20552,"parture from his aunt and uncle’s,” said Dumbledore. “Not to do so"
20553,"will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so well informed."
20554,"However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to"
20555,ensure Harry’s safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And
20556,"Severus, if you are forced to take part in the chase, be sure to act"
20557,your part convincingly. . . . I am counting upon you to remain in
20558,"Lord Voldemort’s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will"
20559,be left to the mercy of the Carrows. . . .”
20560,Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar
20561,"tavern, Mundungus’s face looking curiously blank, Snape frowning"
20562,in concentration.
20563,"“You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,” Snape murmured,"
20564,“that they use decoys. Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It is the
20565,only thing that might work. You will forget that I have suggested
20566,this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?”
20567,"“I understand,” murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused. . . ."
20568,Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a
20569,clear dark night: He was accompanied by other hooded Death Eat-
20570,"ers, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really George. . . ."
20571,"A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing"
20572,it directly at Lupin’s back —
20573,“Sectumsempra!” shouted Snape.
20574,"But the spell, intended for the Death Eater’s wand hand, missed"
20575,and hit George instead —
20576,"And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius’s old bedroom. Tears were"

20579,dripping from the end of his hooked nose as he read the old letter
20580,from Lily. The second page carried only a few words:
20581,could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think
20582,"her mind’s going, personally!"
20583,"Lots of love,"
20584,"Snape took the page bearing Lily’s signature, and her love, and"

20587,"throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor,"
20588,under the chest of drawers. . . .

20620,"F     inally, the truth. Lying with his face pressed into the dusty"
20621,carpet of the office where he had once thought he was learn-
20622,"ing the secrets of victory, Harry understood at last that he was"
20623,not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death’s
20624,"welcoming arms. Along the way, he was to dispose of Voldemort’s"
20625,"remaining links to life, so that when at last he flung himself across"
20626,"Voldemort’s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the"
20627,"end would be clean, and the job that ought to have been done"
20628,"in Godric’s Hollow would be finished: Neither would live, neither"
20629,could survive.
20630,He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that
20631,"in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping"

20639,drum pounding inside him. Would it hurt to die? All those times
20640,"he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he had"
20641,never really thought of the thing itself: His will to live had always
20642,been so much stronger than his fear of death. Yet it did not occur
20643,"to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was over, he"
20644,"knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself: dying."
20645,If he could only have died on that summer’s night when he had

20647,phoenix-feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died
20648,"like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened!"
20649,Or if he could have launched himself in front of a wand to save
20650,someone he loved. . . . He envied even his parents’ deaths now. This
20651,cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different
20652,kind of bravery. He felt his fingers trembling slightly and made an
20653,"effort to control them, although no one could see him; the portraits"
20654,on the walls were all empty.
20655,"Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive"
20656,and more aware of his own living body than ever before. Why had
20657,"he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and nerve and"
20658,"bounding heart? It would all be gone . . . or at least, he would be"
20659,"gone from it. His breath came slow and deep, and his mouth and"
20660,"throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes."
20661,Dumbledore’s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had
20662,"been a bigger plan; Harry had simply been too foolish to see it, he"
20663,realized that now. He had never questioned his own assumption
20664,that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span
20665,had always been determined by how long it took to eliminate all the
20666,Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of destroying them to
20667, 692  
20668,THE FOREST AGAIN
20669,"him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds ty-"
20670,"ing not only Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant,"
20671,"not to waste any more lives, but to give the dangerous task to the"
20672,"boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death"
20673,"would not be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort."
20674,"And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out,"
20675,"that he would keep going to the end, even though it was his end,"
20676,"because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn’t he? Dumble-"
20677,"dore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else"
20678,die for him now that he had discovered it was in his power to stop
20679,"it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead in the Great"
20680,"Hall forced their way back into his mind’s eye, and for a moment"
20681,he could hardly breathe: Death was impatient. . . .
20682,But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed: The
20683,snake survived. One Horcrux remained to bind Voldemort to the
20684,"earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean an"
20685,easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it. . . . Ron
20686,"and Hermione would know what needed to be done, of course. . . ."
20687,That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in
20688,"two others . . . so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early,"
20689,they could carry on. . . .
20690,"Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the"
20691,"hard surface of the incontrovertible truth, which was that he must"
20692,die. I must die. It must end.
20693,"Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country;"
20694,he felt as though he had parted from them long ago. There would
20695,"be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined of that."
20696,"This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts"
20697,they would make to stop him would waste valuable time. He looked
20698, 693   
20699,CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
20700,down at the battered gold watch he had received on his seventeenth
20701,birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his sur-
20702,render had elapsed.
20703,He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic
20704,"bird. Perhaps it knew it had little time left, perhaps it was deter-"
20705,mined to fulfill a lifetime’s beats before the end. He did not look
20706,back as he closed the office door.
20707,"The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as"
20708,if he had already died. The portrait people were still missing from
20709,"their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its remaining"
20710,lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and
20711,the mourners were crammed.
20712,Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended
20713,"through the floors, at last walking down the marble staircase into"
20714,"the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to be sensed,"
20715,"to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable,"
20716,"perfect, and he reached the front doors easily."
20717,Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair
20718,that was carrying a body in from the grounds. Harry glanced down
20719,"and felt another dull blow to his stomach: Colin Creevey, though"
20720,"underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and"
20721,Goyle had done. He was tiny in death.
20722,"“You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,” said Oliver"
20723,"Wood, and he heaved Colin over his shoulder in a fireman’s lift and"
20724,carried him into the Great Hall.
20725,Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped
20726,his forehead with the back of his hand. He looked like an old man.
20727,Then he set off down the steps again into the darkness to recover
20728,more bodies.
20729, 694  
20730,THE FOREST AGAIN
20731,Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall.
20732,"People were moving around, trying to comfort each other, drinking,"
20733,"kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the people he"
20734,"loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weas-"
20735,"leys, no Luna. He felt he would have given all the time remaining"
20736,"to him for just one last look at them; but then, would he ever have"
20737,the strength to stop looking? It was better like this.
20738,He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly
20739,"four in the morning, and the deathly stillness of the grounds felt as"
20740,"though they were holding their breath, waiting to see whether he"
20741,could do what he must.
20742,"Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another"
20743,body.
20744,“Neville.”
20745,"“Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!”"
20746,Harry had pulled off the Cloak: The idea had come to him out
20747,"of nowhere, born out of a desire to make absolutely sure."
20748,"“Where are you going, alone?” Neville asked suspiciously."
20749,"“It’s all part of the plan,” said Harry. “There’s something I’ve got"
20750,to do. Listen — Neville —”
20751,"“Harry!” Neville looked suddenly scared. “Harry, you’re not"
20752,thinking of handing yourself over?”
20753,"“No,” Harry lied easily. “ ’Course not . . . this is something else."
20754,"But I might be out of sight for a while. You know Voldemort’s snake,"
20755,Neville? He’s got a huge snake. . . . Calls it Nagini . . .”
20756,"“I’ve heard, yeah. . . . What about it?”"
20757,"“It’s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in"
20758,case they —”
20759,"The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment,"
20760, 695  
20761,CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
20762,made it impossible to keep talking. But he pulled himself together
20763,"again: This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep a cool"
20764,"head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore"
20765,had died knowing that three people still knew about the Horcruxes;
20766,now Neville would take Harry’s place: There would still be three
20767,in the secret.
20768,“Just in case they’re — busy — and you get the chance —”
20769,“Kill the snake?”
20770,"“Kill the snake,” Harry repeated."
20771,"“All right, Harry. You’re okay, are you?”"
20772,"“I’m fine. Thanks, Neville.”"
20773,But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on.
20774,"“We’re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?”"
20775,"“Yeah, I —”"
20776,The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he
20777,could not go on. Neville did not seem to find it strange. He patted
20778,"Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to look for"
20779,more bodies.
20780,Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Some-
20781,"one else was moving not far away, stooping over another prone"
20782,figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he realized
20783,it was Ginny.
20784,He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was
20785,whispering for her mother.
20786,"“It’s all right,” Ginny was saying. “It’s okay. We’re going to get"
20787,you inside.”
20788,"“But I want to go home,” whispered the girl. “I don’t want to"
20789,fight anymore!”
20790, 696  
20791,THE FOREST AGAIN
20792,"“I know,” said Ginny, and her voice broke. “It’s going to be all"
20793,right.”
20794,Ripples of cold undulated over Harry’s skin. He wanted to shout
20795,"out to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he"
20796,"wanted her to know where he was going. He wanted to be stopped,"
20797,"to be dragged back, to be sent back home. . . ."
20798,But he was home. Hogwarts was the first and best home he had
20799,"known. He and Voldemort and Snape, the abandoned boys, had all"
20800,found home here. . . .
20801,"Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand."
20802,With a huge effort Harry forced himself on. He thought he saw
20803,"Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she had"
20804,"sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did"
20805,not look back.
20806,"Hagrid’s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no"
20807,"sound of Fang scrabbling at the door, his bark booming in welcome."
20808,"All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper kettle on the"
20809,"fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and"
20810,"Ron vomiting slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert . . ."
20811,"He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and"
20812,he stopped.
20813,A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could
20814,"feel their chill, and he was not sure he would be able to pass safely"
20815,through it. He had no strength left for a Patronus. He could no
20816,"longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to"
20817,"die. Every second he breathed, the smell of the grass, the cool air"
20818,"on his face, was so precious: To think that people had years and"
20819,"years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging"
20820, 697   
20821,CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
20822,to each second. At the same time he thought that he would not be
20823,"able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was ended,"
20824,"the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. . . ."
20825,The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the
20826,pouch at his neck and he pulled it out.
20827,I open at the close.
20828,"Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted"
20829,"time to move as slowly as possible, it seemed to have sped up, and un-"
20830,derstanding was coming so fast it seemed to have bypassed thought.
20831,This was the close. This was the moment.
20832,"He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, “I am"
20833,about to die.”
20834,"The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised"
20835,"Draco’s wand beneath the Cloak, and murmured, “Lumos.”"
20836,The black stone with its jagged crack running down the center sat
20837,in the two halves of the Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked
20838,down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. The triangle and
20839,circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible.
20840,And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not
20841,"matter about bringing them back, for he was about to join them. He"
20842,was not really fetching them: They were fetching him.
20843,He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three
20844,times.
20845,"He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements"
20846,around him that suggested frail bodies shifting their footing on the
20847,"earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the forest."
20848,He opened his eyes and looked around.
20849,"They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They"
20850, 698    
20851,THE FOREST AGAIN
20852,resembled most closely the Riddle that had escaped from the diary
20853,"so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. Less sub-"
20854,"stantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved"
20855,"toward him, and on each face, there was the same loving smile."
20856,James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the
20857,"clothes in which he had died, and his hair was untidy and ruffled,"
20858,"and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley’s."
20859,"Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry"
20860,"had seen him in life. He loped with an easy grace, his hands in his"
20861,pockets and a grin on his face.
20862,"Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was"
20863,thicker and darker. He looked happy to be back in this familiar
20864,"place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings."
20865,Lily’s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as
20866,"she drew close to him, and her green eyes, so like his, searched his"
20867,"face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at him"
20868,enough.
20869,“You’ve been so brave.”
20870,"He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that"
20871,"he would like to stand and look at her forever, and that would be"
20872,enough.
20873,"“You are nearly there,” said James. “Very close. We are . . . so"
20874,proud of you.”
20875,“Does it hurt?”
20876,The childish question had fallen from Harry’s lips before he could
20877,stop it.
20878,"“Dying? Not at all,” said Sirius. “Quicker and easier than falling"
20879,asleep.”
20880, 699  
20881,CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
20882,"“And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,” said Lupin."
20883,"“I didn’t want you to die,” Harry said. These words came without"
20884,his volition. “Any of you. I’m sorry —”
20885,"He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him."
20886,"“— right after you’d had your son . . . Remus, I’m sorry —”"
20887,"“I am sorry too,” said Lupin. “Sorry I will never know him . . ."
20888,but he will know why I died and I hope he will understand. I was
20889,trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.”
20890,A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the for-
20891,est lifted the hair at Harry’s brow. He knew that they would not tell
20892,"him to go, that it would have to be his decision."
20893,“You’ll stay with me?”
20894,"“Until the very end,” said James."
20895,“They won’t be able to see you?” asked Harry.
20896,"“We are part of you,” said Sirius. “Invisible to anyone else.”"
20897,Harry looked at his mother.
20898,"“Stay close to me,” he said quietly."
20899,And he set off. The dementors’ chill did not overcome him;
20900,"he passed through it with his companions, and they acted like"
20901,"Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old"
20902,"trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots"
20903,gnarled and twisted underfoot. Harry clutched the Cloak tightly
20904,"around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the"
20905,"forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that"
20906,"he would find him. Beside him, making scarcely a sound, walked"
20907,"James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his cour-"
20908,"age, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front"
20909,of the other.
20910,"His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs work-"
20911, 700  
20912,THE FOREST AGAIN
20913,"ing without conscious instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver,"
20914,in the body he was about to leave. The dead who walked beside him
20915,through the forest were much more real to him now than the living
20916,"back at the castle: Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were"
20917,the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled and slipped toward the
20918,"end of his life, toward Voldemort. . . ."
20919,A thud and a whisper: Some other living creature had stirred close
20920,"by. Harry stopped under the Cloak, peering around, listening, and"
20921,"his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too."
20922,"“Someone there,” came a rough whisper close at hand. “He’s got"
20923,an Invisibility Cloak. Could it be — ?”
20924,Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree: Their wands
20925,"flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and Dolohov peering into the dark-"
20926,"ness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius"
20927,and Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.
20928,"“Definitely heard something,” said Yaxley. “Animal, d’you"
20929,reckon?”
20930,"“That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,” said"
20931,"Dolohov, glancing over his shoulder."
20932,Yaxley looked down at his watch.
20933,“Time’s nearly up. Potter’s had his hour. He’s not coming.”
20934,“And he was sure he’d come! He won’t be happy.”
20935,"“Better go back,” said Yaxley. “Find out what the plan is now.”"
20936,He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry
20937,"followed them, knowing that they would lead him exactly where he"
20938,"wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled at him,"
20939,and his father nodded encouragement.
20940,"They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead,"
20941,and Yaxley and Dolohov stepped out into a clearing that Harry
20942,  701   
20943,CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
20944,knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had once
20945,"lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarm"
20946,of descendants he had spawned had been driven out by the Death
20947,"Eaters, to fight for their cause."
20948,"A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light"
20949,"fell over a crowd of completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some"
20950,of them were still masked and hooded; others showed their faces.
20951,"Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shad-"
20952,"ows over the scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry"
20953,"saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; the great blond Rowle"
20954,"was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked"
20955,"defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and"
20956,full of apprehension.
20957,"Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head"
20958,"bowed, and his white hands folded over the Elder Wand in front of"
20959,"him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently in his"
20960,"mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought"
20961,absurdly of a child counting in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind
20962,"his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini floated"
20963,"in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo."
20964,"When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort"
20965,looked up.
20966,"“No sign of him, my Lord,” said Dolohov."
20967,Voldemort’s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to
20968,burn in the firelight. Slowly he drew the Elder Wand between his
20969,long fingers.
20970,“My Lord —”
20971,"Bellatrix had spoken: She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled,"
20972,her face a little bloody but otherwise unharmed.
20973, 702  
20974,THE FOREST AGAIN
20975,"Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak"
20976,"another word, but eyed him in worshipful fascination."
20977,"“I thought he would come,” said Voldemort in his high, clear"
20978,"voice, his eyes on the leaping flames. “I expected him to come.”"
20979,"Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was"
20980,now throwing itself against his ribs as though determined to escape
20981,the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were sweating as he
20982,"pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes,"
20983,with his wand. He did not want to be tempted to fight.
20984,"“I was, it seems . . . mistaken,” said Voldemort."
20985,“You weren’t.”
20986,"Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could"
20987,muster: He did not want to sound afraid. The Resurrection Stone
20988,"slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of"
20989,"his eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped"
20990,forward into the firelight. At that moment he felt that nobody mat-
20991,tered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them.
20992,The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared
20993,"as the Death Eaters rose together, and there were many cries, gasps,"
20994,"even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, but his red"
20995,"eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him,"
20996,with nothing but the fire between them.
20997,Then a voice yelled: “HARRY! NO!”
20998,"He turned: Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby."
20999,"His massive body shook the branches overhead as he struggled,"
21000,desperate.
21001,"“NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT’RE YEH — ?”"
21002,"“QUIET!” shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand Hagrid"
21003,was silenced.
21004, 703   
21005,CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR
21006,"Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Vol-"
21007,"demort to Harry, her breast heaving. The only things that moved"
21008,"were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the glitter-"
21009,ing cage behind Voldemort’s head.
21010,"Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no at-"
21011,"tempt to draw it. He knew that the snake was too well protected,"
21012,"knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses"
21013,"would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each"
21014,"other, and now Voldemort tilted his head a little to the side, consid-"
21015,"ering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless smile"
21016,curled the lipless mouth.
21017,"“Harry Potter,” he said very softly. His voice might have been"
21018,part of the spitting fire. “The Boy Who Lived.”
21019,None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting: Everything
21020,"was waiting. Hagrid was struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and"
21021,"Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing look, and the"
21022,feel of her lips on his —
21023,Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one
21024,"side, like a curious child, wondering what would happen if he pro-"
21025,"ceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it to hap-"
21026,"pen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control,"
21027,before he betrayed fear —
21028,"He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and every-"
21029,thing was gone.

21033,"H          e lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was perfectly"
21034,alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there.
21035,He was not perfectly sure that he was there himself.
21036,"A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to him that he"
21037,"must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he was"
21038,"lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of"
21039,"touch, and the thing against which he lay existed too."
21040,"Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became"
21041,conscious that he was naked. Convinced as he was of his total soli-
21042,"tude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. He"
21043,"wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In"
21044,"opening them, he discovered that he had eyes."
21045,"He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had"
21046,ever experienced before. His surroundings were not hidden by
21047,cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into sur-
21048,"roundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither"

21050,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21051,"warm nor cold, but simply there, a flat, blank something on which"
21052,to be.
21053,He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face.
21054,He was not wearing glasses anymore.
21055,Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness
21056,that surrounded him: the small soft thumpings of something that
21057,"flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly"
21058,indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdrop-
21059,"ping on something furtive, shameful."
21060,"For the first time, he wished he were clothed."
21061,Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a
21062,short distance away. He took them and pulled them on: They were
21063,"soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had appeared,"
21064,"just like that, the moment he had wanted them. . . ."
21065,"He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of"
21066,"Requirement? The longer he looked, the more there was to see. A"
21067,great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight. Per-
21068,"haps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd"
21069,thumping and whimpering noises coming from somewhere close
21070,by in the mist. . . .
21071,"Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed"
21072,"to invent themselves before his eyes. A wide-open space, bright and"
21073,"clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear,"
21074,domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person
21075,"there, except for —"
21076,He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises.
21077,"It had the form of a small, naked child, curled on the ground, its"
21078,"skin raw and rough, flayed-looking, and it lay shuddering under a"
21079,  706  
21080,KING’S CROSS
21081,"seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, strug-"
21082,gling for breath.
21083,"He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was,"
21084,"he did not want to approach it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer,"
21085,ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near enough to
21086,"touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a cow-"
21087,"ard. He ought to comfort it, but it repulsed him."
21088,“You cannot help.”
21089,"He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him,"
21090,"sprightly and upright, wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue."
21091,"“Harry.” He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole"
21092,"and white and undamaged. “You wonderful boy. You brave, brave"
21093,man. Let us walk.”
21094,"Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where"
21095,"the flayed child lay whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry"
21096,"had not previously noticed, set some distance away under that high,"
21097,"sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry"
21098,"fell into the other, staring at his old headmaster’s face. Dumbledore’s"
21099,"long silver hair and beard, the piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon"
21100,"spectacles, the crooked nose: Everything was as he had remembered"
21101,it. And yet. . .
21102,"“But you’re dead,” said Harry."
21103,"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore matter-of-factly."
21104,“Then . . . I’m dead too?”
21105,"“Ah,” said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. “That is the"
21106,"question, isn’t it? On the whole, dear boy, I think not.”"
21107,"They looked at each other, the old man still beaming."
21108,“Not?” repeated Harry.
21109, 707   
21110,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21111,"“Not,” said Dumbledore."
21112,“But . . .” Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning
21113,scar. It did not seem to be there. “But I should have died — I didn’t
21114,defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!”
21115,"“And that,” said Dumbledore, “will, I think, have made all the"
21116,difference.”
21117,"Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light, like"
21118,"fire: Harry had never seen the man so utterly, so palpably content."
21119,"“Explain,” said Harry."
21120,"“But you already know,” said Dumbledore. He twiddled his"
21121,thumbs together.
21122,"“I let him kill me,” said Harry. “Didn’t I?”"
21123,"“You did,” said Dumbledore, nodding. “Go on!”"
21124,“So the part of his soul that was in me . . .”
21125,"Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry"
21126,"onward, a broad smile of encouragement on his face."
21127,“. . . has it gone?”
21128,"“Oh yes!” said Dumbledore. “Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is"
21129,"whole, and completely your own, Harry.”"
21130,“But then . . .”
21131,"Harry glanced over his shoulder to where the small, maimed"
21132,creature trembled under the chair.
21133,"“What is that, Professor?”"
21134,"“Something that is beyond either of our help,” said Dumble-"
21135,dore.
21136,"“But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,” Harry started again,"
21137,“and nobody died for me this time — how can I be alive?”
21138,"“I think you know,” said Dumbledore. “Think back. Remember"
21139,"what he did, in his ignorance, in his greed and his cruelty.”"
21140, 708  
21141,KING’S CROSS
21142,Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If
21143,"it was indeed a palace in which they sat, it was an odd one, with"
21144,"chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still,"
21145,he and Dumbledore and the stunted creature under the chair were
21146,"the only beings there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, with-"
21147,out effort.
21148,"“He took my blood,” said Harry."
21149,“Precisely!” said Dumbledore. “He took your blood and rebuilt
21150,"his living body with it! Your blood in his veins, Harry, Lily’s protec-"
21151,tion inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he lives!”
21152,“I live . . . while he lives? But I thought . . . I thought it was the
21153,other way round! I thought we both had to die? Or is it the same
21154,thing?”
21155,He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the ago-
21156,nized creature behind them and glanced back at it yet again.
21157,“Are you sure we can’t do anything?”
21158,“There is no help possible.”
21159,"“Then explain . . . more,” said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled."
21160,"“You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never"
21161,meant to make. He had rendered his soul so unstable that it broke
21162,"apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the murder"
21163,"of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped"
21164,from that room was even less than he knew. He left more than his
21165,"body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, the would-be"
21166,victim who had survived.
21167,"“And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That"
21168,"which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to compre-"
21169,"hend. Of house-elves and children’s tales, of love, loyalty, and in-"
21170,"nocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That"

21172,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21173,"they all have a power beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of"
21174,"any magic, is a truth he has never grasped."
21175,“He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took
21176,into his body a tiny part of the enchantment your mother laid upon
21177,"you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrifice alive, and"
21178,"while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort’s"
21179,one last hope for himself.”
21180,"Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him."
21181,“And you knew this? You knew — all along?”
21182,"“I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,” said Dumble-"
21183,"dore happily, and they sat in silence for what seemed like a long time,"
21184,while the creature behind them continued to whimper and tremble.
21185,"“There’s more,” said Harry. “There’s more to it. Why did my wand"
21186,break the wand he borrowed?”
21187,"“As to that, I cannot be sure.”"
21188,"“Have a guess, then,” said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed."
21189,"“What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Vol-"
21190,demort have journeyed together into realms of magic hitherto un-
21191,"known and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is"
21192,"unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have pre-"
21193,dicted it or explained it to Voldemort.
21194,"“Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled"
21195,the bond between you when he returned to a human form. A part
21196,"of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to strengthen"
21197,"himself, he took a part of your mother’s sacrifice into himself. If he"
21198,could only have understood the precise and terrible power of that
21199,"sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to touch your blood. . . ."
21200,"But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord"
21201,"Voldemort, and might never have murdered at all."
21202,  710   
21203,KING’S CROSS
21204,"“Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your"
21205,destinies together more securely than ever two wizards were joined
21206,"in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a wand that"
21207,shared a core with yours. And now something very strange hap-
21208,"pened, as we know. The cores reacted in a way that Lord Volde-"
21209,"mort, who never knew that your wand was twin of his, had never"
21210,expected.
21211,"“He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had ac-"
21212,"cepted, even embraced, the possibility of death, something Lord Vol-"
21213,"demort has never been able to do. Your courage won, your wand"
21214,"overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between"
21215,"those wands, something that echoed the relationship between their"
21216,masters.
21217,“I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and quali-
21218,"ties of Voldemort’s wand that night, which is to say that it contained"
21219,a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him when
21220,"he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal"
21221,"enemy, and it regurgitated some of his own magic against him,"
21222,magic much more powerful than anything Lucius’s wand had ever
21223,performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous
21224,courage and of Voldemort’s own deadly skill: What chance did that
21225,poor stick of Lucius Malfoy’s stand?”
21226,"“But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able"
21227,to break it?” asked Harry.
21228,"“My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Vol-"
21229,"demort, who had tampered so ill-advisedly with the deepest laws"
21230,of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful.
21231,"Otherwise it was a wand like any other . . . though a good one, I"
21232,"am sure,” Dumbledore finished kindly."
21233,  711   
21234,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21235,"Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was"
21236,"very hard to be sure of things like time, here."
21237,“He killed me with your wand.”
21238,"“He failed to kill you with my wand,” Dumbledore corrected"
21239,"Harry. “I think we can agree that you are not dead — though, of"
21240,"course,” he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, “I do not"
21241,"minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.”"
21242,"“I feel great at the moment, though,” said Harry, looking down"
21243,"at his clean, unblemished hands. “Where are we, exactly?”"
21244,"“Well, I was going to ask you that,” said Dumbledore, looking"
21245,around. “Where would you say that we are?”
21246,"Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, how-"
21247,"ever, he found that he had an answer ready to give."
21248,"“It looks,” he said slowly, “like King’s Cross station. Except a lot"
21249,"cleaner and empty, and there are no trains as far as I can see.”"
21250,“King’s Cross station!” Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately.
21251,"“Good gracious, really?”"
21252,"“Well, where do you think we are?” asked Harry, a little defen-"
21253,sively.
21254,"“My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.”"
21255,Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infu-
21256,"riating. He glared at him, then remembered a much more pressing"
21257,question than that of their current location.
21258,"“The Deathly Hallows,” he said, and he was glad to see that the"
21259,words wiped the smile from Dumbledore’s face.
21260,"“Ah, yes,” he said. He even looked a little worried."
21261,“Well?”
21262,"For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked"
21263,  712  
21264,KING’S CROSS
21265,"less than an old man, much less. He looked fleetingly like a small"
21266,boy caught in wrongdoing.
21267,“Can you forgive me?” he said. “Can you forgive me for not trust-
21268,"ing you? For not telling you? Harry, I only feared that you would fail"
21269,as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my mistakes.
21270,"I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that"
21271,you are the better man.”
21272,"“What are you talking about?” asked Harry, startled by Dumble-"
21273,"dore’s tone, by the sudden tears in his eyes."
21274,"“The Hallows, the Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore. “A desper-"
21275,ate man’s dream!”
21276,“But they’re real!”
21277,"“Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,” said Dumbledore."
21278,"“And I was such a fool. But you know, don’t you? I have no secrets"
21279,from you anymore. You know.”
21280,“What do I know?”
21281,"Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still"
21282,sparkled in the brilliantly blue eyes.
21283,"“Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ulti-"
21284,"mately, than Voldemort?”"
21285,"“Of course you were,” said Harry. “Of course — how can you"
21286,ask that? You never killed if you could avoid it!”
21287,"“True, true,” said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking"
21288,"reassurance. “Yet I too sought a way to conquer death, Harry.”"
21289,"“Not the way he did,” said Harry. After all his anger at Dumble-"
21290,"dore, how odd it was to sit here, beneath the high, vaulted ceiling,"
21291,"and defend Dumbledore from himself. “Hallows, not Horcruxes.”"
21292,"“Hallows,” murmured Dumbledore, “not Horcruxes. Precisely.”"
21293, 713   
21294,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21295,"There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but"
21296,Harry no longer looked around.
21297,“Grindelwald was looking for them too?” he asked.
21298,Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded.
21299,"“It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,” he said quietly."
21300,"“Two clever, arrogant boys with a shared obsession. He wanted to"
21301,"come to Godric’s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, because"
21302,of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the
21303,third brother had died.”
21304,“So it’s true?” asked Harry. “All of it? The Peverell brothers —”
21305,"“— were the three brothers of the tale,” said Dumbledore, nod-"
21306,"ding. “Oh yes, I think so. Whether they met Death on a lonely"
21307,road . . . I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply
21308,"gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those power-"
21309,ful objects. The story of them being Death’s own Hallows seems
21310,to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such
21311,creations.
21312,"“The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages,"
21313,"father to son, mother to daughter, right down to Ignotus’s last liv-"
21314,"ing descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the village of"
21315,Godric’s Hollow.”
21316,Dumbledore smiled at Harry.
21317,“Me?”
21318,"“You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my posses-"
21319,sion on the night your parents died. James had showed it to me just
21320,a few days previously. It explained much of his undetected wrong-
21321,doing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked
21322,"to borrow it, to examine it. I had long since given up my dream of"
21323,"uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could not help taking a"
21324, 714   
21325,KING’S CROSS
21326,"closer look. . . . It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen,"
21327,"immensely old, perfect in every respect . . . and then your father"
21328,"died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!”"
21329,His tone was unbearably bitter.
21330,"“The Cloak wouldn’t have helped them survive, though,” Harry"
21331,said quickly. “Voldemort knew where my mum and dad were. The
21332,Cloak couldn’t have made them curse-proof.”
21333,"“True,” sighed Dumbledore. “True.”"
21334,"Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted"
21335,him.
21336,“So you’d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the
21337,Cloak?”
21338,"“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced him-"
21339,self to meet Harry’s eyes. “You know what happened. You know.
21340,You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.”
21341,“But I don’t despise you —”
21342,"“Then you should,” said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath."
21343,"“You know the secret of my sister’s ill health, what those Muggles"
21344,"did, what she became. You know how my poor father sought re-"
21345,"venge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my"
21346,mother gave up her own life to care for Ariana.
21347,"“I resented it, Harry.”"
21348,"Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the"
21349,"top of Harry’s head, into the distance."
21350,"“I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to"
21351,shine. I wanted glory.
21352,"“Do not misunderstand me,” he said, and pain crossed the face"
21353,"so that he looked ancient again. “I loved them. I loved my parents,"
21354,"I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more"
21355, 715    
21356,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21357,"selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could pos-"
21358,sibly imagine.
21359,"“So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility"
21360,"of a damaged sister and a wayward brother, I returned to my village"
21361,"in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! And then,"
21362,"of course, he came. . . .”"
21363,Dumbledore looked directly into Harry’s eyes again.
21364,"“Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me,"
21365,"Harry, inflamed me. Muggles forced into subservience. We wizards"
21366,"triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of the"
21367,revolution.
21368,"“Oh, I had a few scruples. I assuaged my conscience with empty"
21369,"words. It would all be for the greater good, and any harm done"
21370,"would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I know,"
21371,"in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did,"
21372,"but I closed my eyes. If the plans we were making came to fruition,"
21373,all my dreams would come true.
21374,"“And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How"
21375,"they fascinated him, how they fascinated both of us! The unbeatable"
21376,"wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The Resurrection"
21377,"Stone — to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an"
21378,"army of Inferi! To me, I confess, it meant the return of my parents,"
21379,and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders.
21380,"“And the Cloak . . . somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much,"
21381,Harry. Both of us could conceal ourselves well enough without the
21382,"Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can be used to"
21383,"protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we"
21384,"ever found it, it might be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest"
21385,"in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for the legend"
21386,  716   
21387,KING’S CROSS
21388,said that the man who united all three objects would then be truly
21389,"master of death, which we took to mean ‘invincible.’"
21390,"“Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore!"
21391,"Two months of insanity, of cruel dreams, and neglect of the only"
21392,two members of my family left to me.
21393,“And then . . . you know what happened. Reality returned in
21394,"the form of my rough, unlettered, and infinitely more admirable"
21395,brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did
21396,not want to hear that I could not set forth to seek Hallows with a
21397,fragile and unstable sister in tow.
21398,“The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That
21399,"which I had always sensed in him, though I pretended not to, now"
21400,sprang into terrible being. And Ariana . . . after all my mother’s care
21401,and caution . . . lay dead upon the floor.”
21402,Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry
21403,reached out and was glad to find that he could touch him: He gripped
21404,his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained control.
21405,"“Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted."
21406,"He vanished, with his plans for seizing power, and his schemes for"
21407,"Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams in"
21408,"which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was"
21409,"left to bury my sister, and learn to live with my guilt and my terrible"
21410,"grief, the price of my shame."
21411,“Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had
21412,"procured a wand of immense power. I, meanwhile, was offered the"
21413,"post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. Naturally, I"
21414,refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.”
21415,"“But you’d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scrim-"
21416,geour!” burst out Harry.
21417, 717   
21418,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21419,“Would I?” asked Dumbledore heavily. “I am not so sure. I had
21420,"proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my"
21421,"temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who"
21422,are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those
21423,"who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the"
21424,"mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they"
21425,wear it well.
21426,“I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher —”
21427,“You were the best —”
21428,"“— you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with"
21429,"the training of young wizards, Grindelwald was raising an army."
21430,"They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than I"
21431,feared him.
21432,"“Oh, not death,” said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry’s ques-"
21433,tioning look. “Not what he could do to me magically. I knew that
21434,"we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful."
21435,"It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that"
21436,"last, horrific fight, had actually cast the curse that killed my sister."
21437,"You may call me cowardly: You would be right. Harry, I dreaded"
21438,beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought
21439,"about her death, not merely through my arrogance and stupidity,"
21440,but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her life.
21441,"“I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I de-"
21442,"layed meeting him until finally, it would have been too shameful"
21443,"to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable,"
21444,and I had to do what I could.
21445,"“Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the"
21446,wand.”

21448,KING’S CROSS
21449,Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had
21450,"ever found out who struck Ariana dead. He did not want to know,"
21451,and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last
21452,he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the
21453,"Mirror of Erised, and why Dumbledore had been so understanding"
21454,of the fascination it had exercised over Harry.
21455,"They sat in silence for a long time, and the whimperings of the"
21456,creature behind them barely disturbed Harry anymore.
21457,"At last he said, “Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after"
21458,"the wand. He lied, you know, pretended he had never had it.”"
21459,"Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glitter-"
21460,ing on the crooked nose.
21461,"“They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at"
21462,Nurmengard. I hope that it is true. I would like to think he did feel
21463,the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to Vol-
21464,demort was his attempt to make amends . . . to prevent Voldemort
21465,from taking the Hallow . . .”
21466,"“. . . or maybe from breaking into your tomb?” suggested Harry,"
21467,and Dumbledore dabbed his eyes.
21468,"After another short pause Harry said, “You tried to use the Res-"
21469,urrection Stone.”
21470,Dumbledore nodded.
21471,"“When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the aban-"
21472,"doned home of the Gaunts — the Hallow I had craved most of all,"
21473,though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons — I
21474,"lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that"
21475,"the ring was sure to carry a curse. I picked it up, and I put it on,"
21476,"and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and"
21477, 719  
21478,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21479,"my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry I"
21480,was. . . .
21481,"“I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned noth-"
21482,"ing. I was unworthy to unite the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it"
21483,"time and again, and here was final proof.”"
21484,“Why?” said Harry. “It was natural! You wanted to see them
21485,again. What’s wrong with that?”
21486,"“Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I"
21487,"was fit only to possess the meanest of them, the least extraordinary."
21488,"I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not to boast of it, and not to"
21489,"kill with it. I was permitted to tame and to use it, because I took it,"
21490,"not for gain, but to save others from it."
21491,"“But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiosity, and so it could never"
21492,"have worked for me as it works for you, its true owner. The stone I"
21493,"would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace,"
21494,"rather than to enable my self-sacrifice, as you did. You are the worthy"
21495,possessor of the Hallows.”
21496,"Dumbledore patted Harry’s hand, and Harry looked up at the old"
21497,man and smiled; he could not help himself. How could he remain
21498,angry with Dumbledore now?
21499,“Why did you have to make it so difficult?”
21500,Dumbledore’s smile was tremulous.
21501,"“I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry."
21502,I was afraid that your hot head might dominate your good heart.
21503,"I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those"
21504,"tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong"
21505,"time, for the wrong reasons. If you laid hands on them, I wanted you"
21506,"to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, because the"
21507,true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that
21508,  720   
21509,KING’S CROSS
21510,"he must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in"
21511,the living world than dying.”
21512,“And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?”
21513,"“I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection"
21514,Stone he turned into a Horcrux. But even if he had known about
21515,"them, Harry, I doubt that he would have been interested in any ex-"
21516,"cept the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as"
21517,"for the stone, whom would he want to bring back from the dead?"
21518,He fears the dead. He does not love.”
21519,“But you expected him to go after the wand?”
21520,"“I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat"
21521,"Voldemort’s in the graveyard of Little Hangleton. At first, he was"
21522,afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had
21523,"kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the"
21524,twin cores. He thought that explained everything. Yet the borrowed
21525,"wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead of asking"
21526,himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so
21527,"strong, what gift you possessed that he did not, naturally set out to"
21528,"find the one wand that, they said, would beat any other. For him,"
21529,the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with
21530,you. He believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and
21531,makes him truly invincible. Poor Severus . . .”
21532,"“If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end"
21533,"up with the Elder Wand, didn’t you?”"
21534,"“I admit that was my intention,” said Dumbledore, “but it did"
21535,"not work as I intended, did it?”"
21536,"“No,” said Harry. “That bit didn’t work out.”"
21537,"The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and"
21538,Dumbledore sat without talking for the longest time yet. The
21539, 721  
21540,CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE
21541,realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry
21542,"in the long minutes, like softly falling snow."
21543,"“I’ve got to go back, haven’t I?”"
21544,“That is up to you.”
21545,“I’ve got a choice?”
21546,"“Oh yes.” Dumbledore smiled at him. “We are in King’s Cross,"
21547,"you say? I think that if you decided not to go back, you would be"
21548,able to . . . let’s say . . . board a train.”
21549,“And where would it take me?”
21550,"“On,” said Dumbledore simply."
21551,Silence again.
21552,“Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand.”
21553,“True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.”
21554,“But you want me to go back?”
21555,"“I think,” said Dumbledore, “that if you choose to return, there"
21556,is a chance that he may be finished for good. I cannot promise it.
21557,"But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from returning"
21558,here than he does.”
21559,Harry glanced again at the raw-looking thing that trembled and
21560,choked in the shadow beneath the distant chair.
21561,"“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those"
21562,"who live without love. By returning, you may ensure that fewer souls"
21563,"are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems to you a"
21564,"worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.”"
21565,Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly
21566,"as hard as walking into the forest had been, but it was warm and light"
21567,"and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading back to pain and"
21568,"the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same,"
21569,and they looked for a long moment into each other’s faces.
21570, 722   
21571,KING’S CROSS
21572,"“Tell me one last thing,” said Harry. “Is this real? Or has this"
21573,been happening inside my head?”
21574,"Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and"
21575,strong in Harry’s ears even though the bright mist was descending
21576,"again, obscuring his figure."
21577,"“Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on"
21578,earth should that mean that it is not real?”

21581,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
21582,H          e was lying facedown on the ground again. The smell of
21583,the forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold hard
21584,"ground beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses, which had"
21585,"been knocked sideways by the fall, cutting into his temple. Every"
21586,"inch of him ached, and the place where the Killing Curse had hit"
21587,"him felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did not stir, but"
21588,"remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at"
21589,an awkward angle and his mouth gaping.
21590,He had expected to hear cheers of triumph and jubilation at his
21591,"death, but instead hurried footsteps, whispers, and solicitous mur-"
21592,murs filled the air.
21593,“My Lord . . . my Lord . . .”
21594,"It was Bellatrix’s voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did"
21595,"not dare open his eyes, but allowed his other senses to explore his"
21596,predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed beneath his
21597,robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the
21598, 724   
21599,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
21600,ground. A slight cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told
21601,"him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, stuffed out of sight."
21602,“My Lord . . .”
21603,"“That will do,” said Voldemort’s voice."
21604,More footsteps: Several people were backing away from the same
21605,"spot. Desperate to see what was happening and why, Harry opened"
21606,his eyes by a millimeter.
21607,Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eat-
21608,"ers were hurrying away from him, returning to the crowd lining"
21609,"the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside"
21610,Voldemort.
21611,Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The
21612,"Death Eaters had been huddled around Voldemort, who seemed to"
21613,have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when he had
21614,hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed?
21615,It seemed like it. And both of them had fallen briefly unconscious
21616,and both of them had now returned. . . .
21617,"“My Lord, let me —”"
21618,"“I do not require assistance,” said Voldemort coldly, and though"
21619,"he could not see it, Harry pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful"
21620,hand. “The boy . . . Is he dead?”
21621,There was complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached
21622,"Harry, but he felt their concentrated gaze; it seemed to press him"
21623,"harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or an eyelid"
21624,might twitch.
21625,"“You,” said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shriek"
21626,of pain. “Examine him. Tell me whether he is dead.”
21627,Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could
21628,"only lie there, with his heart thumping traitorously, and wait to be"
21629, 725   
21630,CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
21631,"examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though it"
21632,"was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort"
21633,suspected that all had not gone to plan. . . .
21634,"Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry’s face,"
21635,"pulled back an eyelid, crept beneath his shirt, down to his chest,"
21636,"and felt his heart. He could hear the woman’s fast breathing, her"
21637,long hair tickled his face. He knew that she could feel the steady
21638,pounding of life against his ribs.
21639,“Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”
21640,The whisper was barely audible; her lips were an inch from his
21641,"ear, her head bent so low that her long hair shielded his face from"
21642,the onlookers.
21643,"“Yes,” he breathed back."
21644,He felt the hand on his chest contract; her nails pierced him.
21645,Then it was withdrawn. She had sat up.
21646,“He is dead!” Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers.
21647,"And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped"
21648,"their feet, and through his eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver"
21649,light shoot into the air in celebration.
21650,"Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew"
21651,"that the only way she would be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and"
21652,"find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no longer cared"
21653,whether Voldemort won.
21654,“You see?” screeched Voldemort over the tumult. “Harry Potter is
21655,"dead by my hand, and no man alive can threaten me now! Watch!"
21656,Crucio!”
21657,"Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed"
21658,to remain unsullied upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to
21659,humiliation to prove Voldemort’s victory. He was lifted into the
21660, 726   
21661,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
21662,"air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet the pain"
21663,"he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times"
21664,into the air: His glasses flew off and he felt his wand slide a little
21665,"beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, and when"
21666,"he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers"
21667,and shrieks of laughter.
21668,"“Now,” said Voldemort, “we go to the castle, and show"
21669,them what has become of their hero. Who shall drag the body?
21670,No — Wait —”
21671,"There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments"
21672,Harry felt the ground trembling beneath him.
21673,"“You carry him,” Voldemort said. “He will be nice and visible in"
21674,"your arms, will he not? Pick up your little friend, Hagrid. And the"
21675,glasses — put on the glasses — he must be recognizable —”
21676,Someone slammed Harry’s glasses back onto his face with deliber-
21677,"ate force, but the enormous hands that lifted him into the air were"
21678,exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid’s arms trembling with
21679,the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as
21680,"Hagrid cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by move-"
21681,"ment or word, to intimate to Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost."
21682,"“Move,” said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing"
21683,"his way through the close-growing trees, back through the forest."
21684,"Branches caught at Harry’s hair and robes, but he lay quiescent, his"
21685,"mouth lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the"
21686,"Death Eaters crowed all around them, and while Hagrid sobbed"
21687,"blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed"
21688,neck of Harry Potter. . . .
21689,The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry
21690,could hear trees creaking and falling as they passed; they made so
21691, 727   
21692,CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
21693,"much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the jeers of"
21694,the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched
21695,"on toward the open ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by"
21696,"the lightening of the darkness through his closed eyelids, that the"
21697,trees were beginning to thin.
21698,“BANE!”
21699,Hagrid’s unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry’s eyes open.
21700,"“Happy now, are yeh, that yeh didn’ fight, yeh cowardly bunch o’"
21701,nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter’s — d-dead . . . ?”
21702,"Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry"
21703,wondered how many centaurs were watching their procession pass;
21704,he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters called
21705,"insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry"
21706,"sensed, by a freshening of the air, that they had reached the edge"
21707,of the forest.
21708,“Stop.”
21709,Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Volde-
21710,"mort’s command, because he lurched a little. And now a chill settled"
21711,"over them where they stood, and Harry heard the rasping breath of"
21712,the dementors that patrolled the outer trees. They would not affect
21713,"him now. The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman"
21714,"against them, as though his father’s stag kept guardian in his heart."
21715,"Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Volde-"
21716,"mort himself because he spoke a moment later, his voice magically"
21717,"magnified so that it swelled through the grounds, crashing upon"
21718,Harry’s eardrums.
21719,"“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to"
21720,save himself while you lay down your lives for him. We bring you
21721,his body as proof that your hero is gone.

21724,“The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death
21725,"Eaters outnumber you, and the Boy Who Lived is finished. There"
21726,"must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, woman,"
21727,"or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their fam-"

21729,"spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live"
21730,"and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall"
21731,build together.”
21732,There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort
21733,was so close to him that Harry did not dare open his eyes again.
21734,"“Come,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and"
21735,"Hagrid was forced to follow. Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction,"
21736,"and saw Voldemort striding in front of them, wearing the great snake"
21737,"Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But"
21738,Harry had no possibility of extracting the wand concealed under his
21739,"robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who marched on"
21740,either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness. . . .
21741,"“Harry,” sobbed Hagrid. “Oh, Harry . . . Harry . . .”"
21742,Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were ap-
21743,"proaching the castle and strained his ears to distinguish, above the"
21744,"gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs"
21745,of life from those within.
21746,“Stop.”
21747,The Death Eaters came to a halt: Harry heard them spreading
21748,out in a line facing the open front doors of the school. He could
21749,"see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light"
21750,streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any mo-
21751,"ment, the people for whom he had tried to die would see him, lying"
21752,"apparently dead, in Hagrid’s arms."

21754,CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
21755,“NO!”
21756,The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected
21757,or dreamed that Professor McGonagall could make such a sound.
21758,"He heard another woman laughing nearby, and knew that Bellatrix"
21759,gloried in McGonagall’s despair. He squinted again for a single sec-
21760,"ond and saw the open doorway filling with people, as the survivors"
21761,of the battle came out onto the front steps to face their vanquishers
21762,and see the truth of Harry’s death for themselves. He saw Voldemort
21763,"standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini’s head with a single"
21764,white finger. He closed his eyes again.
21765,“No!”
21766,“No!”
21767,“Harry! HARRY!”
21768,"Ron’s, Hermione’s, and Ginny’s voices were worse than McGona-"
21769,"gall’s; Harry wanted nothing more than to call back, yet he made"
21770,"himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd of"
21771,"survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the"
21772,"Death Eaters, until —"
21773,"“SILENCE!” cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash"
21774,"of bright light, and silence was forced upon them all. “It is over! Set"
21775,"him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!”"
21776,Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass.
21777,"“You see?” said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward"
21778,and forward right beside the place where he lay. “Harry Potter is
21779,"dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, ever,"
21780,but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!”
21781,"“He beat you!” yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defend-"

21783,more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.

21786,"“He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds,”"
21787,"said Voldemort, and there was relish in his voice for the lie, “killed"
21788,while trying to save himself —”
21789,"But Voldemort broke off: Harry heard a scuffle and a shout, then"
21790,"another bang, a flash of light, and a grunt of pain; he opened his"
21791,eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had broken free of the crowd
21792,"and charged at Voldemort: Harry saw the figure hit the ground,"
21793,"Disarmed, Voldemort throwing the challenger’s wand aside and"
21794,laughing.
21795,“And who is this?” he said in his soft snake’s hiss. “Who has vol-
21796,unteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to
21797,fight when the battle is lost?”
21798,Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh.
21799,"“It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving"
21800,"the Carrows so much trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?”"
21801,"“Ah, yes, I remember,” said Voldemort, looking down at Neville,"
21802,"who was struggling back to his feet, unarmed and unprotected,"
21803,standing in the no-man’s-land between the survivors and the Death
21804,"Eaters. “But you are a pureblood, aren’t you, my brave boy?” Volde-"
21805,"mort asked Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled"
21806,in fists.
21807,“So what if I am?” said Neville loudly.
21808,"“You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You"
21809,"will make a very valuable Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville"
21810,Longbottom.”
21811,"“I’ll join you when hell freezes over,” said Neville. “Dumble-"
21812,"dore’s Army!” he shouted, and there was an answering cheer from"
21813,"the crowd, whom Voldemort’s Silencing Charms seemed unable to"
21814,hold.

21816,CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
21817,"“Very well,” said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in"
21818,the silkiness of his voice than in the most powerful curse. “If that is
21819,"your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On your"
21820,"head,” he said quietly, “be it.”"
21821,"Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his"
21822,"wand. Seconds later, out of one of the castle’s shattered windows,"
21823,something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through the half
21824,light and landed in Voldemort’s hand. He shook the mildewed ob-
21825,"ject by its pointed end and it dangled, empty and ragged: the Sort-"
21826,ing Hat.
21827,"“There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School,” said Vol-"
21828,"demort. “There will be no more Houses. The emblem, shield, and"
21829,"colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for every-"
21830,"one. Won’t they, Neville Longbottom?”"
21831,"He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then"
21832,"forced the hat onto Neville’s head, so that it slipped down below his"
21833,eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in front of
21834,"the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding"
21835,the fighters of Hogwarts at bay.
21836,“Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to any-
21837,"one foolish enough to continue to oppose me,” said Voldemort, and"
21838,"with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst into"
21839,flames.
21840,"Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot,"
21841,"unable to move, and Harry could not bear it: He must act —"
21842,And then many things happened at the same moment.
21843,They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as
21844,what sounded like hundreds of people came swarming over the out-
21845,"of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war cries."

21847,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
21848,"At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the"
21849,"castle and yelled, “HAGGER!” His cry was answered by roars from"
21850,"Voldemort’s giants: They ran at Grawp like bull elephants, making"
21851,"the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and"
21852,"arrows were suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke"
21853,"ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak"
21854,"from inside his robes, swung it over himself, and sprang to his feet,"
21855,as Neville moved too.
21856,"In one swift, fluid motion, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind"
21857,Curse upon him; the flaming hat fell off him and he drew from its
21858,"depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle —"
21859,The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of
21860,the oncoming crowd or the sounds of the clashing giants or of the
21861,"stampeding centaurs, and yet it seemed to draw every eye. With a"
21862,"single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake’s head, which spun"
21863,"high into the air, gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance"
21864,"hall, and Voldemort’s mouth was open in a scream of fury that"
21865,"nobody could hear, and the snake’s body thudded to the ground at"
21866,his feet —
21867,"Hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm"
21868,between Neville and Voldemort before the latter could raise his
21869,"wand. Then, over the screams and the roars and the thunderous"
21870,"stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid’s yell came loudest of all."
21871,“HARRY!” Hagrid shouted. “HARRY — WHERE’S HARRY?”
21872,Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death
21873,"Eaters, everyone was fleeing the giants’ stamping feet, and nearer"
21874,and nearer thundered the reinforcements that had come from who
21875,knew where; Harry saw great winged creatures soaring around the
21876,"heads of Voldemort’s giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff"

21879,scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and pummeled them;
21880,"and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike,"
21881,were being forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes
21882,"and curses at any Death Eater he could see, and they crumpled, not"
21883,"knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled"
21884,by the retreating crowd.
21885,"Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffeted"
21886,into the entrance hall: He was searching for Voldemort and saw
21887,"him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed into"
21888,"the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he"
21889,"sent curses flying left and right; Harry cast more Shield Charms,"
21890,"and Voldemort’s would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and Hannah"
21891,"Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the"
21892,fight already flourishing inside it.
21893,"And now there were more, even more people storming up the"
21894,"front steps, and Harry saw Charlie Weasley overtaking Horace"
21895,"Slughorn, who was still wearing his emerald pajamas. They seemed"
21896,to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and
21897,"friends of every Hogwarts student who had remained to fight, along"
21898,with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. The centaurs
21899,"Bane, Ronan, and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter"
21900,"of hooves, as behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was"
21901,blasted off its hinges.
21902,"The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall,"
21903,"screaming and waving carving knives and cleavers, and at their head,"
21904,"the locket of Regulus Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher,"
21905,his bullfrog’s voice audible even above this din: “Fight! Fight! Fight

21911,"Eaters, their tiny faces alive with malice, and everywhere Harry"
21912,"looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of numbers,"
21913,"overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the"
21914,"leg by elves, or else simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by"
21915,the oncoming horde.
21916,"But it was not over yet: Harry sped between duelers, past strug-"

21918,"Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking"
21919,"and smiting all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but"
21920,"fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the Great Hall became"
21921,more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their
21922,way inside.
21923,Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jor-

21928,"Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and Narcissa"

21933,"and ducked around him, unable to finish him —"
21934,"Bellatrix was still fighting too, fifty yards away from Voldemort,"
21935,"and like her master she dueled three at once: Hermione, Ginny, and"
21936,"Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to them,"
21937,and Harry’s attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close
21938,to Ginny that she missed death by an inch —

21942,but before he had gone a few steps he was knocked sideways.
21943,"“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”"
21944,"Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms."
21945,"Bellatrix spun on the spot, roaring with laughter at the sight of her"
21946,new challenger.
21947,"“OUT OF MY WAY!” shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls,"
21948,and with a swipe of her wand she began to duel. Harry watched with
21949,"terror and elation as Molly Weasley’s wand slashed and twirled, and"
21950,Bellatrix Lestrange’s smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light
21951,"flew from both wands, the floor around the witches’ feet became"
21952,hot and cracked; both women were fighting to kill.
21953,"“No!” Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying"
21954,to come to her aid. “Get back! Get back! She is mine!”
21955,"Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights,"
21956,"Voldemort and his three opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry"
21957,"stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack and yet to"
21958,"protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent."
21959,“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” taunted
21960,"Bellatrix, as mad as her master, capering as Molly’s curses danced"
21961,around her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?”
21962,“You — will — never — touch — our — children — again!”
21963,screamed Mrs. Weasley.
21964,"Bellatrix laughed, the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius"
21965,"had given as he toppled backward through the veil, and suddenly"
21966,Harry knew what was going to happen before it did.
21967,Molly’s curse soared beneath Bellatrix’s outstretched arm and hit
21968,"her squarely in the chest, directly over her heart."

21975,Harry felt as though he turned in slow motion; he saw McGona-

21977,"ing through the air, as Voldemort’s fury at the fall of his last, best"
21978,lieutenant exploded with the force of a bomb. Voldemort raised his
21979,wand and directed it at Molly Weasley.
21980,"“Protego!” roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the"
21981,"middle of the Hall, and Voldemort stared around for the source as"
21982,Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last.
21983,"The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of “Harry!”"
21984,"“HE’S ALIVE!” were stifled at once. The crowd was afraid, and si-"
21985,lence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked at
21986,"each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other."
21987,"“I don’t want anyone else to try to help,” Harry said loudly, and"
21988,in the total silence his voice carried like a trumpet call. “It’s got to
21989,be like this. It’s got to be me.”
21990,Voldemort hissed.
21991,"“Potter doesn’t mean that,” he said, his red eyes wide. “That isn’t"
21992,"how he works, is it? Who are you going to use as a shield today,"
21993,Potter?”
21994,"“Nobody,” said Harry simply. “There are no more Horcruxes. It’s"
21995,"just you and me. Neither can live while the other survives, and one"
21996,of us is about to leave for good. . . .”
21997,"“One of us?” jeered Voldemort, and his whole body was taut and"

22004,"They were still moving sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle,"
22005,"maintaining the same distance from each other, and for Harry no"

22007,"that graveyard? Accident, that I didn’t defend myself tonight, and"
22008,"still survived, and returned to fight again?”"
22009,"“Accidents!” screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and"
22010,"the watching crowd was frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds"
22011,"in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. “Accident and"
22012,chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the
22013,"skirts of greater men and women, and permitted me to kill them"
22014,for you!”
22015,"“You won’t be killing anyone else tonight,” said Harry as they"

22017,be able to kill any of them ever again. Don’t you get it? I was ready

22019,“But you did not!”

22024,do you?”

22027,Riddle. I know lots of important things that you don’t. Want to

22036,"bledore’s favorite solution, love, which he claimed conquered death,"
22037,though love did not stop him falling from the tower and breaking
22038,"like an old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out"
22039,"your Mudblood mother like a cockroach, Potter — and nobody"
22040,seems to love you enough to run forward this time and take my

22042,"“Just one thing,” said Harry, and still they circled each other,"
22043,"wrapped in each other, held apart by nothing but the last secret."
22044,"“If it is not love that will save you this time,” said Voldemort, “you"
22045,"must believe that you have magic that I do not, or else a weapon"
22046,more powerful than mine?”
22047,"“I believe both,” said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the"
22048,"snakelike face, though it was instantly dispelled; Voldemort began"
22049,"to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his screams;"
22050,"humorless and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall."
22051,"“You think you know more magic than I do?” he said. “Than I,"
22052,"than Lord Voldemort, who has performed magic that Dumbledore"

22054,"“Oh, he dreamed of it,” said Harry, “but he knew more than you,"
22055,knew enough not to do what you’ve done.”

22067,“Dumbledore is dead !” Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as

22073,"before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you thought"

22149,its allegiance. . . .”
22150,"Voldemort’s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the"

22153,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
22154,“The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.”
22155,"Blank shock showed in Voldemort’s face for a moment, but then"
22156,it was gone.
22157,"“But what does it matter?” he said softly. “Even if you are right,"
22158,"Potter, it makes no difference to you and me. You no longer have"
22159,the phoenix wand: We duel on skill alone . . . and after I have killed
22160,"you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy. . . .”"
22161,"“But you’re too late,” said Harry. “You’ve missed your chance. I"
22162,got there first. I overpowered Draco weeks ago. I took this wand
22163,from him.”
22164,"Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of ev-"
22165,eryone in the Hall upon it.
22166,"“So it all comes down to this, doesn’t it?” whispered Harry. “Does"
22167,the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because
22168,if it does . . . I am the true master of the Elder Wand.”
22169,A red-gold glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above
22170,them as an edge of dazzling sun appeared over the sill of the near-
22171,"est window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so"
22172,that Voldemort’s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high
22173,"voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing"
22174,Draco’s wand:
22175,“Avada Kedavra!”
22176,“Expelliarmus!”
22177,"The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that"
22178,"erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been"
22179,"treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw"
22180,"Voldemort’s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly"
22181,"high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling"
22182,"like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the master"

22185,"it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last."
22186,"And Harry, with the unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand"
22187,"in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms splayed, the slit"
22188,pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor
22189,"with a mundane finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white"
22190,"hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and unknowing. Voldemort"
22191,"was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with"
22192,"two wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy’s shell."
22193,"One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment sus-"
22194,pended: and then the tumult broke around Harry as the screams
22195,and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce
22196,"new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and"
22197,"the first to reach him were Ron and Hermione, and it was their arms"
22198,"that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts that"
22199,"deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then"
22200,"all the Weasleys and Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and"
22201,"Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word that anyone"
22202,"was shouting, nor tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him,"
22203,"trying to hug some part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all"
22204,"of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the reason it was"
22205,over at last —
22206,"The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed"
22207,with life and light. Harry was an indispensable part of the mingled
22208,"outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and celebration."
22209,"They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their"
22210,"savior and their guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the"
22211,"company of only a few of them, seemed to occur to no one. He must"
22212,"speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive"
22213,"their thanks, hear the news now creeping in from every quarter as"

22216,the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and down the country
22217,"had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else"
22218,"being captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at"
22219,"that very moment, and that Kingsley Shacklebolt had been named"
22220,temporary Minister of Magic. . . .
22221,They moved Voldemort’s body and laid it in a chamber off the
22222,"Hall, away from the bodies of Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey,"
22223,and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had re-
22224,"placed the House tables, but nobody was sitting according to House"
22225,"anymore: All were jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts"
22226,"and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze lay recovering"
22227,"in a corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and"
22228,"people were throwing food into his laughing mouth. After a while,"
22229,"exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench"
22230,beside Luna.
22231,"“I’d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,” she said."
22232,"“I’d love some,” he replied."
22233,"“I’ll distract them all,” she said. “Use your Cloak.”"
22234,"And before he could say a word she had cried, “Oooh, look, a"
22235,Blibbering Humdinger!” and pointed out of the window. Everyone
22236,"who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over him-"
22237,"self, and got to his feet."
22238,Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He
22239,spotted Ginny two tables away; she was sitting with her head on
22240,"her mother’s shoulder: There would be time to talk later, hours"
22241,"and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the"
22242,"sword of Gryffindor lying beside his plate as he ate, surrounded"
22243,by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables
22244,"he walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as"

22246,CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX
22247,"though unsure whether or not they were supposed to be there, but"
22248,nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked he
22249,"saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company"
22250,he craved most.
22251,"“It’s me,” he muttered, crouching down between them. “Will"
22252,you come with me?”
22253,"They stood up at once, and together he, Ron, and Hermione"
22254,left the Great Hall. Great chunks were missing from the marble
22255,"staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains"
22256,occurred every few steps as they climbed.
22257,Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through
22258,the corridors singing a victory song of his own composition:
22259,"We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter’s the one,"
22260,"And Voldy’s gone moldy, so now let’s have fun!"
22261,"“Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing,"
22262,"doesn’t it?” said Ron, pushing open a door to let Harry and Hermi-"
22263,one through.
22264,"Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was"
22265,"muffled by exhaustion, and the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and"
22266,Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. Most of all
22267,"he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he"
22268,"owed an explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him"
22269,"for so long, and who deserved the truth. Painstakingly he recounted"
22270,"what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the forest,"
22271,and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement
22272,"when at last they arrived at the place to which they had been walking,"
22273,though none of them had mentioned their destination.
22274,  746   
22275,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
22276,"Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to"
22277,"the headmaster’s study had been knocked aside; it stood lopsided,"
22278,"looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it would"
22279,be able to distinguish passwords anymore.
22280,“Can we go up?” he asked the gargoyle.
22281,"“Feel free,” groaned the statue."
22282,They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that
22283,moved slowly upward like an escalator. Harry pushed open the
22284,door at the top.
22285,"He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where"
22286,"he had left it, and then an earsplitting noise made him cry out,"
22287,thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth of
22288,Voldemort —
22289,"But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and"
22290,headmistresses of Hogwarts were giving him a standing ovation;
22291,"they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they reached"
22292,through their frames to grip each other’s hands; they danced up and
22293,down on the chairs in which they had been painted; Dilys Derwent
22294,sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was waving his ear-trumpet;
22295,"and Phineas Nigellus called, in his high, reedy voice, “And let it be"
22296,noted that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not
22297,be forgotten!”
22298,But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest
22299,portrait directly behind the headmaster’s chair. Tears were sliding
22300,down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long silver
22301,"beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled"
22302,Harry with the same balm as phoenix song.
22303,"At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully"
22304,"silent, beaming and mopping their eyes and waiting eagerly for him"

22307,"to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, and chose"
22308,them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he
22309,"was, he must make one last effort, seeking one last piece of advice."
22310,"“The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,” he began, “I dropped"
22311,"it in the forest. I don’t know exactly where, but I’m not going to go"
22312,looking for it again. Do you agree?”
22313,"“My dear boy, I do,” said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures"
22314,"looked confused and curious. “A wise and courageous decision, but"
22315,no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone else know
22316,where it fell?”
22317,"“No one,” said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction."
22318,"“I’m going to keep Ignotus’s present, though,” said Harry, and"
22319,Dumbledore beamed.
22320,"“But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!”"
22321,“And then there’s this.”
22322,"Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked"
22323,"at it with a reverence that, even in his befuddled and sleep-deprived"
22324,"state, Harry did not like to see."
22325,"“I don’t want it,” said Harry."
22326,“What?” said Ron loudly. “Are you mental?”
22327,"“I know it’s powerful,” said Harry wearily. “But I was happier"
22328,with mine. So . . .”
22329,"He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled"
22330,out the two halves of holly still just connected by the finest thread
22331,of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be re-
22332,"paired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this"
22333,"did not work, nothing would."
22334,"He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster’s desk, touched it"
22335,"with the very tip of the Elder Wand, and said, “Reparo.”"
22336, 748   
22337,THE FLAW IN THE PLAN
22338,"As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew"
22339,that he had succeeded. He picked up the holly and phoenix wand
22340,"and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and hand"
22341,were rejoicing at their reunion.
22342,"“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” he told Dumbledore, who was"
22343,"watching him with enormous affection and admiration, “back where"
22344,"it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus,"
22345,"its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never"
22346,have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.”
22347,Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.
22348,“Are you sure?” said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing
22349,in his voice as he looked at the Elder Wand.
22350,"“I think Harry’s right,” said Hermione quietly."
22351,"“That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth,” said Harry. “And"
22352,"quite honestly,” he turned away from the painted portraits, think-"
22353,ing now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in Gryf-

22360,A        utumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The morning
22361,"of the first of September was crisp and golden as an apple,"
22362,and as the little family bobbed across the rumbling road toward
22363,"the great sooty station, the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of"
22364,pedestrians sparkled like cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages
22365,rattled on top of the laden trolleys the parents were pushing; the
22366,"owls inside them hooted indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed"
22367,"tearfully behind her brothers, clutching her father’s arm."
22368,"“It won’t be long, and you’ll be going too,” Harry told her."
22369,"“Two years,” sniffed Lily. “I want to go now!”"
22370,The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove
22371,its way toward the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Albus’s
22372,voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; his sons
22373,had resumed the argument they had started in the car.
22374,“I won’t! I won’t be in Slytherin!”
22375,"“James, give it a rest!” said Ginny."

22378,"“I only said he might be,” said James, grinning at his younger"
22379,brother. “There’s nothing wrong with that. He might be in
22380,Slyth —”
22381,But James caught his mother’s eye and fell silent. The five Potters
22382,approached the barrier. With a slightly cocky look over his shoulder
22383,"at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his mother and"
22384,"broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished."
22385,"“You’ll write to me, won’t you?” Albus asked his parents immedi-"
22386,"ately, capitalizing on the momentary absence of his brother."
22387,"“Every day, if you want us to,” said Ginny."
22388,"“Not every day,” said Albus quickly. “James says most people only"
22389,get letters from home about once a month.”
22390,"“We wrote to James three times a week last year,” said Ginny."
22391,“And you don’t want to believe everything he tells you about
22392,"Hogwarts,” Harry put in. “He likes a laugh, your brother.”"
22393,"Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering"
22394,"speed. As they reached the barrier, Albus winced, but no collision"
22395,"came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and three-"
22396,"quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring"
22397,from the scarlet Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming
22398,"through the mist, into which James had already disappeared."
22399,"“Where are they?” asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy"
22400,forms they passed as they made their way down the platform.
22401,"“We’ll find them,” said Ginny reassuringly."
22402,"But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out any-"
22403,"body’s faces. Detached from their owners, voices sounded unnatu-"
22404,rally loud. Harry thought he heard Percy discoursing loudly on

22406,and say hello. . . .

22409,"“I think that’s them, Al,” said Ginny suddenly."
22410,"A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside"
22411,"the very last carriage. Their faces only came into focus when Harry,"
22412,"Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them."
22413,"“Hi,” said Albus, sounding immensely relieved."
22414,"Rose, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes,"
22415,beamed at him.
22416,"“Parked all right, then?” Ron asked Harry. “I did. Hermione"
22417,"didn’t believe I could pass a Muggle driving test, did you? She"
22418,thought I’d have to Confund the examiner.”
22419,"“No, I didn’t,” said Hermione, “I had complete faith in you.”"
22420,"“As a matter of fact, I did Confund him,” Ron whispered to"
22421,"Harry, as together they lifted Albus’s trunk and owl onto the train."
22422,"“I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let’s face it, I can use"
22423,a Supersensory Charm for that.”
22424,"Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose’s younger"
22425,"brother, having an animated discussion about which House they"
22426,would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts.
22427,"“If you’re not in Gryffindor, we’ll disinherit you,” said Ron, “but"
22428,no pressure.”
22429,“Ron!”
22430,"Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn."
22431,"“He doesn’t mean it,” said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no"
22432,"longer paying attention. Catching Harry’s eye, he nodded covertly to"
22433,"a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned for a moment,"
22434,and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.
22435,“Look who it is.”

22443,turned away again.
22444,"“So that’s little Scorpius,” said Ron under his breath. “Make sure"
22445,"you beat him in every test, Rosie. Thank God you inherited your"

22453,“Hey!”

22456,"“Teddy’s back there,” he said breathlessly, pointing back over his"
22457,shoulder into the billowing clouds of steam. “Just seen him! And
22458,guess what he’s doing? Snogging Victoire!”

22516,"could hear, and she was tactful enough to pretend to be waving to"
22517,"Rose, who was now on the train, “you were named for two headmas-"
22518,ters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably
22519,the bravest man I ever knew.”
22520,“But just say —”
22521,"“— then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student,"
22522,"won’t it? It doesn’t matter to us, Al. But if it matters to you, you’ll"
22523,be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat takes
22524,your choice into account.”
22525,“Really?”
22526,"“It did for me,” said Harry."
22527,"He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw"
22528,the wonder in Albus’s face when he said it. But now the doors were
22529,"slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of par-"
22530,"ents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders."

22532,NINETEEN YEARS LATER
22533,Albus jumped into the carriage and Ginny closed the door behind
22534,him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest them. A great
22535,"number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned"
22536,toward Harry.
22537,“Why are they all staring?” demanded Albus as he and Rose
22538,craned around to look at the other students.
22539,"“Don’t let it worry you,” said Ron. “It’s me. I’m extremely"
22540,famous.”
22541,"Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. The train began to move,"
22542,"and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son’s thin face, al-"
22543,"ready ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even"
22544,"though it was like a little bereavement, watching his son glide away"
22545,from him. . . .
22546,The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train
22547,rounded a corner. Harry’s hand was still raised in farewell.
22548,"“He’ll be all right,” murmured Ginny."
22549,"As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and"
22550,touched the lightning scar on his forehead.
22551,“I know he will.”
22552,The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well.
