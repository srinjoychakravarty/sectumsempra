93,CHAPTER ONE
94,THE BOY WHO LIVED
95,"M            r. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were"
96,"proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank"
97,you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be in-
98,"volved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t"
99,hold with such nonsense.
100,"Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which"
101,"made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al-"
102,though he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
103,"and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which"
104,came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over
105,"garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small"
106,son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy any-
107,where.
108,"The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a"
109,"secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it."
110, 1 
111,CHAPTER ONE
112,They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
113,"Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met"
114,"for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a"
115,"sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as"
116,unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to
117,think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the
118,"street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but"
119,they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason
120,for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with
121,a child like that.
122,"When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday"
123,"our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to"
124,suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happen-
125,ing all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his
126,"most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily"
127,as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.
128,"None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the"
129,window.
130,"At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked"
131,"Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but"
132,"missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing"
133,"his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left"
134,the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s
135,drive.
136,It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of
137,"something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr."
138,Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he jerked his head
139,around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner
140, 2  
141,THE BOY WHO LIVED
142,"of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he"
143,have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr.
144,Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Durs-
145,"ley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in"
146,"his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no,"
147,looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley
148,gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he
149,drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of
150,drills he was hoping to get that day.
151,"But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by"
152,"something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he"
153,couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely
154,dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear
155,people who dressed in funny clothes — the getups you saw on
156,young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He
157,drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a
158,huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis-
159,pering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a
160,"couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older"
161,"than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of"
162,him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some
163,silly stunt — these people were obviously collecting for some-
164,"thing . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few"
165,"minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot,"
166,his mind back on drills.
167,Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office
168,"on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to"
169,concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swoop-
170, 3 
171,CHAPTER ONE
172,"ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did;"
173,they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped over-
174,head. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr.
175,"Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He"
176,yelled at five different people. He made several important tele-
177,phone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood
178,"until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk"
179,across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.
180,He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a
181,group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he
182,"passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This"
183,"bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single"
184,"collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large"
185,"doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were"
186,saying.
187,"“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”"
188,"“— yes, their son, Harry —”"
189,Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at
190,"the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but"
191,thought better of it.
192,"He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office,"
193,"snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone,"
194,and had almost finished dialing his home number when he
195,changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his
196,"mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such"
197,an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Pot-
198,"ter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even"
199,sure his nephew was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It
200, 4  
201,THE BOY WHO LIVED
202,might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in wor-
203,rying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her
204,sister. He didn’t blame her — if he’d had a sister like that . . . but all
205,"the same, those people in cloaks . . ."
206,He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon
207,"and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried"
208,that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.
209,"“Sorry,” he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost"
210,fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man
211,was wearing a violet cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being al-
212,"most knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a"
213,"wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare,"
214,"“Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Re-"
215,"joice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like your-"
216,"self should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”"
217,And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and
218,walked off.
219,Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a
220,"complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle,"
221,whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off
222,"for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never"
223,"hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination."
224,"As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he"
225,saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d
226,spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He
227,was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its
228,eyes.
229,“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
230, 5 
231,CHAPTER ONE
232,The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this nor-
233,mal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself to-
234,"gether, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to"
235,mention anything to his wife.
236,"Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over din-"
237,ner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how
238,Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to
239,"act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the"
240,living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:
241,"“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the"
242,nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although
243,"owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight,"
244,there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every
245,direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls
246,have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster al-
247,"lowed himself a grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim"
248,McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls
249,"tonight, Jim?”"
250,"“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but"
251,it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as
252,"far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to"
253,"tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a"
254,downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating
255,"Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can"
256,promise a wet night tonight.”
257,Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over
258,Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all
259,"over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . ."
260, 6 
261,THE BOY WHO LIVED
262,Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of
263,tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared
264,"his throat nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from"
265,"your sister lately, have you?”"
266,"As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. Af-"
267,"ter all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister."
268,"“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”"
269,"“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls . . ."
270,shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in
271,town today . . .”
272,“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.
273,"“Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do"
274,with . . . you know . . . her crowd.”
275,Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley
276,wondered whether he dared tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.”
277,"He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could,"
278,"“Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”"
279,"“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly."
280,"“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”"
281,"“Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”"
282,"“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I"
283,quite agree.”
284,He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs
285,"to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley"
286,crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front gar-
287,den. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as
288,though it were waiting for something.
289,Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do
290, 7  
291,CHAPTER ONE
292,with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to
293,"a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it."
294,The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but
295,"Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last,"
296,comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters
297,"were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and"
298,Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia
299,thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see how he
300,and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going
301,on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them. . . .
302,How very wrong he was.
303,"Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but"
304,the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was
305,"sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far cor-"
306,ner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as quiver when a car door
307,"slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead."
308,"In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all."
309,"A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, ap-"
310,peared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just
311,popped out of the ground. The cat’s tail twitched and its eyes nar-
312,rowed.
313,Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He
314,"was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and"
315,"beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was"
316,"wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and"
317,"high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and"
318,sparkling behind half-moon spectacles and his nose was very long
319,"and crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This"
320,man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.
321, 8  
322,THE BOY WHO LIVED
323,Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived
324,in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwel-
325,"come. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for some-"
326,"thing. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he"
327,"looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from"
328,"the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat"
329,"seemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have"
330,known.”
331,He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It
332,"seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up"
333,"in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street lamp went out with a"
334,little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into dark-
335,"ness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights"
336,"left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance,"
337,which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out
338,"of their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t"
339,be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement.
340,Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set
341,"off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the"
342,"wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he"
343,spoke to it.
344,"“Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”"
345,"He turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was"
346,smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing square
347,glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its
348,"eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair"
349,was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
350,“How did you know it was me?” she asked.
351,"“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly.”"
352, 9 
353,CHAPTER ONE
354,"“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a brick wall all day,” said"
355,Professor McGonagall.
356,“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have
357,passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”
358,Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
359,"“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently."
360,"“You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Mug-"
361,gles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She
362,jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I
363,"heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they’re not"
364,completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shoot-
365,ing stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He
366,never had much sense.”
367,"“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had"
368,precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”
369,"“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that’s"
370,"no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless,"
371,"out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle"
372,"clothes, swapping rumors.”"
373,"She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as"
374,"though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so"
375,"she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-"
376,"Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found"
377,"out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?”"
378,"“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be"
379,thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”
380,“A what?”
381,“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather
382,fond of.”
383,  10 
384,THE BOY WHO LIVED
385,"“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though"
386,"she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say,"
387,even if You-Know-Who has gone —”
388,"“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call"
389,him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven
390,years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his
391,"proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dum-"
392,"bledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to no-"
393,tice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I
394,have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s
395,name.”
396,"“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half"
397,"exasperated, half admiring. “But you’re different. Everyone knows"
398,"you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was fright-"
399,ened of.”
400,"“You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had"
401,powers I will never have.”
402,“Only because you’re too — well — noble to use them.”
403,“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam
404,Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”
405,Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and
406,"said, “The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying"
407,around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disap-
408,peared? About what finally stopped him?”
409,It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she
410,"was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting"
411,"on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had"
412,she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It
413,"was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going"
414, 11  
415,CHAPTER ONE
416,"to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore,"
417,"however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer."
418,"“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Vol-"
419,demort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Pot-
420,ters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that
421,they’re — dead.”
422,Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
423,“Lily and James . . . I can’t believe it . . . I didn’t want to believe
424,"it . . . Oh, Albus . . .”"
425,Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I
426,know . . . I know . . .” he said heavily.
427,Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s
428,"not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry."
429,But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows
430,"why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry"
431,"Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s"
432,gone.”
433,Dumbledore nodded glumly.
434,“It’s — it’s true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s
435,done . . . all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy?
436,It’s just astounding . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in
437,the name of heaven did Harry survive?”
438,"“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”"
439,Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and
440,dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a great
441,sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It
442,was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; in-
443,"stead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have"
444, 12  
445,THE BOY WHO LIVED
446,"made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his"
447,"pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d"
448,"be here, by the way?”"
449,"“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re"
450,"going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”"
451,“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the
452,only family he has left now.”
453,“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?”
454,"cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at"
455,number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them
456,all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And
457,they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up
458,"the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”"
459,"“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt"
460,and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older.
461,I’ve written them a letter.”
462,"“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back"
463,"down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain"
464,all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be
465,famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known
466,as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written
467,about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!”
468,"“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top"
469,of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s
470,head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something
471,he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll
472,"be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”"
473,"Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind,"
474,  13  
475,CHAPTER ONE
476,"swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But"
477,"how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak sud-"
478,denly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath
479,it.
480,“Hagrid’s bringing him.”
481,“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as im-
482,portant as this?”
483,"“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore."
484,"“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor"
485,"McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless."
486,He does tend to — what was that?”
487,A low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them. It
488,grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for
489,some sign of a headlight; it swelled to a roar as they both looked up
490,at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed
491,on the road in front of them.
492,"If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting"
493,astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least
494,"five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so"
495,wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his
496,"face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their"
497,"leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he"
498,was holding a bundle of blankets.
499,"“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And"
500,where did you get that motorcycle?”
501,"“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climb-"
502,ing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black
503,"lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”"
504, 14 
505,THE BOY WHO LIVED
506,"“No problems, were there?”"
507,"“No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all"
508,right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as
509,we was flyin’ over Bristol.”
510,Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the
511,"bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep."
512,Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a cu-
513,"riously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning."
514,“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
515,"“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”"
516,"“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”"
517,"“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one"
518,myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Un-
519,"derground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this"
520,over with.”
521,Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the
522,Dursleys’ house.
523,"“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He"
524,"bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must"
525,"have been a very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid"
526,let out a howl like a wounded dog.
527,"“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Mug-"
528,gles!”
529,"“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handker-"
530,chief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’
531,James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —”
532,"“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or"
533,"we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid"
534, 15  
535,CHAPTER ONE
536,gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden
537,wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the
538,"doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s"
539,"blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute"
540,the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s
541,"shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and the"
542,twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed
543,to have gone out.
544,"“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business"
545,staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”
546,"“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this"
547,"bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumble-"
548,"dore, sir.”"
549,"Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung"
550,himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a
551,roar it rose into the air and off into the night.
552,"“I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said"
553,"Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose"
554,in reply.
555,Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the
556,corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it
557,"once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so"
558,that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a
559,tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street.
560,He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number
561,four.
562,"“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and"
563,"with a swish of his cloak, he was gone."
564, 16  
565,THE BOY WHO LIVED
566,"A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent"
567,"and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect"
568,astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his
569,blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter
570,"beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not know-"
571,"ing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few"
572,hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door
573,"to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few"
574,weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He
575,"couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret"
576,all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in
577,hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”

579,CHAPTER TWO
580,THE VANISHING GLASS
581,N         early ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken
582,"up to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive"
583,had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gar-
584,dens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys’ front door;
585,"it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same"
586,as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful
587,news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantel-
588,"piece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago,"
589,there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink
590,beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Durs-
591,"ley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large"
592,"blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing"
593,"a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his"
594,mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the
595,"house, too."
596, 18  
597,The Vanishing Glass
598,"Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not"
599,for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice
600,that made the first noise of the day.
601,“Up! Get up! Now!”
602,Harry woke with a start. His aunt rapped on the door again.
603,“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the
604,kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the
605,stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he
606,had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying
607,motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream
608,before.
609,His aunt was back outside the door.
610,“Are you up yet?” she demanded.
611,"“Nearly,” said Harry."
612,"“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the bacon. And"
613,"don’t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s"
614,birthday.”
615,Harry groaned.
616,“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.
617,"“Nothing, nothing . . .”"
618,Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got
619,slowly out of bed and started looking for socks. He found a pair
620,"under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them"
621,"on. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the"
622,"stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept."
623,When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen.
624,The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday pres-
625,ents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he
626, 19   
627,CHAPTER TWO
628,"wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike."
629,"Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry,"
630,as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it in-
631,volved punching somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was
632,"Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he"
633,was very fast.
634,"Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard,"
635,but Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked
636,even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to
637,"wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four"
638,"times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees,"
639,"black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held to-"
640,gether with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had
641,punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his
642,own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was
643,shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could re-
644,"member, and the first question he could ever remember asking his"
645,Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
646,"“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And"
647,don’t ask questions.”
648,Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with
649,the Dursleys.
650,Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the
651,bacon.
652,"“Comb your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting."
653,"About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his"
654,newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must
655,have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put
656, 20 
657,The Vanishing Glass
658,"together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that"
659,way — all over the place.
660,Harry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen
661,with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a
662,"large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick"
663,"blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia"
664,often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said
665,that Dudley looked like a pig in a wig.
666,"Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was"
667,"difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was"
668,counting his presents. His face fell.
669,"“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father."
670,“That’s two less than last year.”
671,"“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s"
672,here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.”
673,"“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face."
674,"Harry, who could see a huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began"
675,wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned
676,the table over.
677,"Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said"
678,"quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out"
679,"today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”"
680,Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally
681,"he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .”"
682,"“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia."
683,“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel.
684,“All right then.”
685,Uncle Vernon chuckled.
686, 21   
687,CHAPTER TWO
688,"“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’Atta"
689,"boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley’s hair."
690,At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to
691,answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap
692,"the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen"
693,"new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a"
694,gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone
695,looking both angry and worried.
696,"“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She"
697,can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.
698,"Dudley’s mouth fell open in horror, but Harry’s heart gave a"
699,"leap. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a"
700,"friend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants,"
701,"or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a"
702,mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The
703,whole house smelled of cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look at
704,photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.
705,"“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously at Harry as"
706,though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that
707,"Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded"
708,"himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies,"
709,"Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again."
710,"“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested."
711,"“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”"
712,"The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he"
713,"wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty"
714,"that couldn’t understand them, like a slug."
715,"“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”"
716, 22  
717,The Vanishing Glass
718,"“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia."
719,"“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be"
720,able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe
721,even have a go on Dudley’s computer).
722,Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just swallowed a lemon.
723,“And come back and find the house in ruins?” she snarled.
724,"“I won’t blow up the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listen-"
725,ing.
726,"“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia"
727,"slowly, “. . . and leave him in the car. . . .”"
728,"“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. . . .”"
729,"Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it"
730,had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he
731,"screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him any-"
732,thing he wanted.
733,"“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him spoil"
734,"your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him."
735,“I . . . don’t . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled
736,"between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He"
737,shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.
738,"Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!”"
739,"said Aunt Petunia frantically — and a moment later, Dudley’s best"
740,"friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a"
741,scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held
742,people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley
743,stopped pretending to cry at once.
744,"Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sit-"
745,"ting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the"
746, 23 
747,CHAPTER TWO
748,way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle
749,"hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but be-"
750,"fore they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside."
751,"“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face"
752,"right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny"
753,"business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from"
754,now until Christmas.”
755,"I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly . . .”"
756,But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.
757,"The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry"
758,and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them
759,happen.
760,"Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the bar-"
761,"bers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of"
762,kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except
763,"for his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley"
764,"had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night"
765,"imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for"
766,"his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had"
767,gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petu-
768,nia had sheared it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard
769,"for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain"
770,how it had grown back so quickly.
771,"Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a"
772,revolting old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls).
773,"The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed"
774,"to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but"
775,certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must
776, 24   
777,The Vanishing Glass
778,"have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t pun-"
779,ished.
780,"On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being"
781,found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been
782,"chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone"
783,"else’s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had re-"
784,ceived a very angry letter from Harry’s headmistress telling them
785,Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do
786,(as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cup-
787,board) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen
788,doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in
789,mid-jump.
790,"But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth be-"
791,ing with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that
792,"wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living"
793,room.
794,"While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He"
795,"liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council,"
796,"Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects."
797,"This morning, it was motorcycles."
798,"“. . . roaring along like maniacs, the young hoodlums,” he said,"
799,as a motorcycle overtook them.
800,"“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering"
801,suddenly. “It was flying.”
802,Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned
803,"right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic"
804,beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”
805,Dudley and Piers sniggered.
806, 25   
807,CHAPTER TWO
808,"“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”"
809,But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the
810,"Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talk-"
811,"ing about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was"
812,in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get
813,dangerous ideas.
814,It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with fam-
815,ilies. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice
816,"creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the"
817,van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him
818,"away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either,"
819,"Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its"
820,"head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t"
821,blond.
822,Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was
823,careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley
824,"and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by"
825,"lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting"
826,"him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a"
827,tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice
828,"cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry"
829,was allowed to finish the first.
830,"Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too"
831,good to last.
832,After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark
833,"in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all"
834,sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of
835,"wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous"
836, 26  
837,The Vanishing Glass
838,"cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found"
839,the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice
840,around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at
841,"the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep."
842,"Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at"
843,the glistening brown coils.
844,"“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped"
845,"on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge."
846,"“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass"
847,"smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on."
848,"“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away."
849,Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the
850,snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom
851,itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers
852,on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than hav-
853,"ing a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petu-"
854,nia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit
855,the rest of the house.
856,"The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it"
857,raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.
858,It winked.
859,Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone
860,was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and
861,"winked, too."
862,"The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley,"
863,then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said
864,quite plainly:
865,“I get that all the time.”
866, 27   
867,CHAPTER TWO
868,"“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t"
869,sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”
870,The snake nodded vigorously.
871,"“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked."
872,The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry
873,peered at it.
874,"Boa Constrictor, Brazil."
875,“Was it nice there?”
876,The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry
877,"read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve"
878,never been to Brazil?”
879,"As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry"
880,made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME
881,AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE
882,WHAT IT’S DOING!”
883,Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.
884,"“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs."
885,"Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What"
886,came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one
887,"second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass,"
888,"the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror."
889,Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s
890,"tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly,"
891,slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house
892,screamed and started running for the exits.
893,"As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low,"
894,"hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, amigo.”"
895,The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.
896, 28  
897,The Vanishing Glass
898,"“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?”"
899,"The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong,"
900,sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dud-
901,"ley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t"
902,"done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but"
903,"by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was"
904,"telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was"
905,"swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for"
906,"Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was"
907,"talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”"
908,Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house be-
909,fore starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He
910,"managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he"
911,"collapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a"
912,large brandy.
913,"Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch."
914,He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Durs-
915,"leys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to"
916,the kitchen for some food.
917,"He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable"
918,"years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby"
919,and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember
920,"being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he"
921,"strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came"
922,up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn-
923,"ing pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though"
924,he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He
925, 29  
926,CHAPTER TWO
927,couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never
928,"spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions."
929,There were no photographs of them in the house.
930,"When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of"
931,"some unknown relation coming to take him away, but it had never"
932,happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he
933,thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to
934,"know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a"
935,violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with
936,Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew
937,"the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without"
938,buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green
939,had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A bald man in a very long
940,purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day
941,and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all
942,these people was the way they seemed to vanish the second Harry
943,tried to get a closer look.
944,"At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s"
945,gang hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and bro-
946,"ken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang."

949,THE LETTERS

951,T       he escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his
952,longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of
953,"his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley"
954,"had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote con-"
955,"trol airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down"
956,old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her crutches.
957,"Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dud-"
958,"ley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis,"
959,"Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was"
960,"the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of"
961,them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry
962,Hunting.
963,This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the
964,"house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holi-"
965,"days, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came"
966,"he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in"
967, 31 
968,CHAPTER THREE
969,"his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at"
970,"Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was go-"
971,"ing there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall"
972,"High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny."
973,“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at
974,"Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”"
975,"“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything"
976,"as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran,"
977,before Dudley could work out what he’d said.
978,"One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy"
979,"his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg"
980,wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping
981,"over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as"
982,before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of choco-
983,late cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.
984,"That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the"
985,family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon
986,"tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters."
987,"They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while"
988,the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good train-
989,ing for later life.
990,"As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Ver-"
991,non said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt
992,Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle
993,"Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t"
994,trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already
995,have cracked from trying not to laugh.

998,THE LETTERS

1000,There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when
1001,Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large
1002,metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of
1003,what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.
1004,“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they
1005,always did if he dared to ask a question.
1006,"“Your new school uniform,” she said."
1007,Harry looked in the bowl again.
1008,"“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”"
1009,"“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of"
1010,Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s
1011,when I’ve finished.”
1012,"Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue."
1013,He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was
1014,going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was
1015,"wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably."
1016,"Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses"
1017,because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon
1018,opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting
1019,"stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table."
1020,They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the
1021,doormat.
1022,"“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his pa-"
1023,per.
1024,“Make Harry get it.”
1025,"“Get the mail, Harry.”"
1026,“Make Dudley get it.”
1027,"“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”"
1028,  33   
1029,CHAPTER THREE
1030,Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three
1031,things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister
1032,"Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown enve-"
1033,"lope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry."
1034,"Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a gi-"
1035,"ant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him."
1036,"Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t be-"
1037,"long to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for"
1038,"books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there"
1039,could be no mistake:
1040,Mr. H. Potter
1041,The Cupboard under the Stairs
1042,4 Privet Drive
1043,Little Whinging
1044,Surrey
1045,"The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment,"
1046,and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no
1047,stamp.
1048,"Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a pur-"
1049,"ple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a"
1050,snake surrounding a large letter H.
1051,"“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen."
1052,"“What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at"
1053,his own joke.
1054,"Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He"
1055,"handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and"
1056,slowly began to open the yellow envelope.
1057, 34  
1058,THE LETTERS
1059,FROM NO ONE
1060,"Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and"
1061,flipped over the postcard.
1062,"“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny"
1063,whelk . . .”
1064,"“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!”"
1065,"Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was writ-"
1066,"ten on the same heavy parchment as the envelope, when it was"
1067,jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.
1068,"“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back."
1069,"“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the"
1070,letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from
1071,red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop
1072,there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.
1073,“P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.
1074,"Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held"
1075,it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the
1076,first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She
1077,clutched her throat and made a choking noise.
1078,“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”
1079,"They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry"
1080,and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ig-
1081,nored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting
1082,stick.
1083,"“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly."
1084,"“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”"
1085,"“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the let-"
1086,ter back inside its envelope.
1087,Harry didn’t move.
1088,“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.
1089, 35   
1090,CHAPTER THREE
1091,“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.
1092,"“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and"
1093,Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the
1094,"hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley"
1095,promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at
1096,"the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one"
1097,"ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and"
1098,floor.
1099,"“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at"
1100,the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You
1101,don’t think they’re watching the house?”
1102,"“Watching — spying — might be following us,” muttered Un-"
1103,cle Vernon wildly.
1104,"“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell"
1105,them we don’t want —”
1106,Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and
1107,down the kitchen.
1108,"“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an an-"
1109,"swer. . . . Yes, that’s best . . . we won’t do anything. . . .”"
1110,“But —”
1111,"“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when"
1112,we took him in we’d stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”
1113,"That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did"
1114,something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cup-
1115,board.
1116,"“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had"
1117,squeezed through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”
1118, 36 
1119,THE LETTERS
1120,FROM NO ONE
1121,"“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Ver-"
1122,non shortly. “I have burned it.”
1123,"“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard"
1124,on it.”
1125,"“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell"
1126,from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his
1127,"face into a smile, which looked quite painful."
1128,"“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I"
1129,have been thinking . . . you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we
1130,think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bed-
1131,room.”
1132,“Why?” said Harry.
1133,“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff up-
1134,"stairs, now.”"
1135,The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon
1136,"and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister,"
1137,"Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all"
1138,the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only
1139,took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from
1140,the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and stared
1141,around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old
1142,"video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had"
1143,once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was
1144,"Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through"
1145,when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large
1146,"birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped"
1147,"at school for a real air rifle, which was up on a shelf with the end all"
1148,bent because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of
1149, 37 
1150,CHAPTER THREE
1151,books. They were the only things in the room that looked as
1152,though they’d never been touched.
1153,From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his
1154,"mother, “I don’t want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make"
1155,him get out. . . .”
1156,Harry sighed and stretched out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have
1157,given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cup-
1158,board with that letter than up here without it.
1159,"Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was"
1160,"in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting"
1161,"stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tor-"
1162,"toise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room"
1163,back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly
1164,wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt
1165,Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.
1166,"When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying"
1167,"to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him"
1168,banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall.
1169,"Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Small-"
1170,"est Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’ ”"
1171,"With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran"
1172,"down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to wres-"
1173,"tle Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was"
1174,made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon
1175,"around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting,"
1176,"in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon"
1177,"straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in"
1178,his hand.

1182,"“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed"
1183,at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”
1184,Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew
1185,he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know
1186,he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try
1187,again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a
1188,plan.
1189,The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning.
1190,Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn’t wake
1191,the Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning on any of the
1192,lights.
1193,He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet
1194,Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered
1195,as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door —
1196,“AAAAARRRGH!”
1197,Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and
1198,squashy on the doormat — something alive!
1199,Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that
1200,"the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon"
1201,"had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag,"
1202,clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been try-
1203,ing to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then
1204,told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off
1205,"into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived,"
1206,right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters ad-
1207,dressed in green ink.
1208,"“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters"
1209,into pieces before his eyes.
1210, 39 
1211,CHAPTER THREE
1212,Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and
1213,nailed up the mail slot.
1214,"“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails,"
1215,“if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”
1216,"“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”"
1217,"“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re"
1218,"not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail"
1219,with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
1220,"On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they"
1221,couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the
1222,"door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the"
1223,small window in the downstairs bathroom.
1224,"Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters,"
1225,he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around
1226,the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed
1227,"“Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small"
1228,noises.
1229,"On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters"
1230,"to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden in-"
1231,side each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman
1232,had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While
1233,Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and
1234,"the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia"
1235,shredded the letters in her food processor.
1236,“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked
1237,Harry in amazement.

1240,THE LETTERS
1241,FROM NO ONE
1242,"On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table"
1243,"looking tired and rather ill, but happy."
1244,"“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he"
1245,"spread marmalade on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”"
1246,Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he
1247,spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next mo-
1248,"ment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like"
1249,"bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to"
1250,catch one —
1251,“Out! OUT!”
1252,Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into
1253,the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their
1254,"arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They"
1255,"could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off"
1256,the walls and floor.
1257,"“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but"
1258,pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want
1259,you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away.
1260,Just pack some clothes. No arguments!”
1261,He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no
1262,one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way
1263,"through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward"
1264,the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had
1265,hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack
1266,"his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag."
1267,They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare
1268,ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon
1269,would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a
1270,while.
1271, 41  
1272,CHAPTER THREE
1273,"“Shake ’em off . . . shake ’em off,” he would mutter whenever he"
1274,did this.
1275,They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was
1276,"howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry,"
1277,"he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d"
1278,never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.
1279,Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on
1280,the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with
1281,"twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry"
1282,"stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights"
1283,of passing cars and wondering. . . .
1284,They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for
1285,breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of
1286,the hotel came over to their table.
1287,"“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an"
1288,’undred of these at the front desk.”
1289,She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:
1290,Mr. H. Potter
1291,Room 17
1292,Railview Hotel
1293,Cokeworth
1294,Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his
1295,hand out of the way. The woman stared.
1296,"“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and fol-"
1297,lowing her from the dining room.

1302,"“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia"
1303,"suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to"
1304,"hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He"
1305,"drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around,"
1306,"shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The"
1307,"same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway"
1308,"across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking"
1309,garage.
1310,"“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia"
1311,"dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast,"
1312,"locked them all inside the car, and disappeared."
1313,It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dud-
1314,ley sniveled.
1315,"“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on"
1316,tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”
1317,Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Mon-
1318,day — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of
1319,"the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was"
1320,"Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never ex-"
1321,"actly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger"
1322,"and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven"
1323,every day.
1324,Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carry-
1325,"ing a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she"
1326,asked what he’d bought.
1327,“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone
1328,out!”
1329,It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at
1330,what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the
1331, 43  
1332,CHAPTER THREE
1333,rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One
1334,"thing was certain, there was no television in there."
1335,"“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clap-"
1336,ping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to
1337,lend us his boat!”
1338,"A toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a"
1339,"rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray"
1340,water below them.
1341,"“I’ve already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all"
1342,aboard!”
1343,It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down
1344,their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what
1345,"seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slip-"
1346,"ping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house."
1347,"The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind"
1348,"whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace"
1349,was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
1350,Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and
1351,four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just
1352,smoked and shriveled up.
1353,"“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheer-"
1354,fully.
1355,He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody
1356,stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail.
1357,"Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up"
1358,at all.
1359,"As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. Spray"
1360,from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce
1361, 44  
1362,THE LETTERS
1363,FROM NO ONE
1364,wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy
1365,blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the
1366,moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed
1367,"next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he"
1368,"could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket."
1369,The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went
1370,"on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get"
1371,"comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores"
1372,were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near mid-
1373,"night. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over"
1374,"the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten"
1375,"minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, won-"
1376,"dering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the"
1377,letter writer was now.
1378,Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He
1379,"hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be"
1380,warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet
1381,Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be
1382,able to steal one somehow.
1383,"Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock"
1384,like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching
1385,noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?
1386,One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . .
1387,"twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to"
1388,annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . .
1389,BOOM.
1390,"The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at"
1391,"the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in."

1393,CHAPTER FOUR
1394,THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
1395,B    OOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.
1396,“Where’s the cannon?” he said stupidly.
1397,There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skid-
1398,ding into the room. He was holding a rifle in his hands — now
1399,"they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought"
1400,with them.
1401,“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”
1402,There was a pause. Then —
1403,SMASH!
1404,The door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its
1405,hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.
1406,A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was al-
1407,"most completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild,"
1408,"tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black"
1409,beetles under all the hair.
1410,  46  
1411,THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
1412,"The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his"
1413,"head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door,"
1414,and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm out-
1415,side dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.
1416,"“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy"
1417,journey. . . .”
1418,He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with fear.
1419,"“Budge up, yeh great lump,” said the stranger."
1420,"Dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was"
1421,"crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon."
1422,“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.
1423,"Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that"
1424,the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.
1425,"“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh"
1426,"look a lot like yer dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”"
1427,Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.
1428,"“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are break-"
1429,ing and entering!”
1430,"“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said the giant; he"
1431,"reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Ver-"
1432,"non’s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of"
1433,"rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room."
1434,"Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being"
1435,trodden on.
1436,"“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the"
1437,"Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat fer yeh"
1438,"here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”"
1439,From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly
1440,  47  
1441,CHAPTER FOUR
1442,squashed box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a
1443,"large, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on"
1444,it in green icing.
1445,"Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but"
1446,"the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said in-"
1447,"stead was, “Who are you?”"
1448,The giant chuckled.
1449,"“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of"
1450,Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”
1451,He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.
1452,"“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands to-"
1453,"gether. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”"
1454,His eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in
1455,it and he snorted. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t
1456,"see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there"
1457,was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering
1458,light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk
1459,into a hot bath.
1460,"The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his"
1461,"weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his"
1462,"coat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a"
1463,"teapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid"
1464,that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut
1465,was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a
1466,"thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat,"
1467,"juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a lit-"
1468,"tle. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you,"
1469,Dudley.”
1470,The giant chuckled darkly.

1473,"“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Durs-"

1475,"He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had"
1476,"never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his"
1477,"eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain any-"
1478,"thing, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”"
1479,The giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back
1480,of his hand.
1481,"“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh,"
1482,I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hog-
1483,"warts, o’ course.”"
1484,"“Er — no,” said Harry."
1485,Hagrid looked shocked.
1486,"“Sorry,” Harry said quickly."
1487,"“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who"
1488,shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew
1489,yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even
1490,"know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder"
1491,where yer parents learned it all?”
1492,“All what?” asked Harry.
1493,“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”
1494,He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole
1495,hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.
1496,"“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this"
1497,boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”
1498,"Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school,"
1499,"after all, and his marks weren’t bad."
1500,"“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and"
1501,stuff.”
1502, 49    
1503,CHAPTER FOUR
1504,"But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world,"
1505,I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”
1506,“What world?”
1507,Hagrid looked as if he was about to explode.
1508,“DURSLEY!” he boomed.
1509,"Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something"
1510,that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.
1511,"“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean,"
1512,they’re famous. You’re famous.”
1513,"“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?”"
1514,“Yeh don’ know . . . yeh don’ know . . .” Hagrid ran his fingers
1515,"through his hair, fixing Harry with a bewildered stare."
1516,“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.
1517,Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
1518,"“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell"
1519,the boy anything!”
1520,A braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under
1521,"the furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his"
1522,every syllable trembled with rage.
1523,“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter
1524,"Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it,"
1525,Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?”
1526,“Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.
1527,“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.
1528,Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of horror.
1529,"“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer"
1530,a wizard.”
1531,There was silence inside the hut. Only the sea and the whistling
1532,wind could be heard.

1535,“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.

1538,"I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like"

1560,Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he
1561,couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he stam-
1562,"mered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?”"
1563,"“Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a"
1564,"hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a cart horse,"
1565,and from yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an
1566,"owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long quill, and a"
1567,roll of parchment. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled
1568,a note that Harry could read upside down:
1569,"Dear Professor Dumbledore,"
1570,Given Harry his letter.
1571,Taking him to buy his things tomorrow.
1572,Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.
1573,Hagrid
1574,"Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which clamped it in"
1575,"its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm."
1576,Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as
1577,talking on the telephone.
1578,Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
1579,"“Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon,"
1580,"still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the fire-"

1582,"“He’s not going,” he said."

1589,them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest
1590,Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”
1591,“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rub-

1593,indeed!”
1594,“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”
1595,“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we
1596,"knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she"
1597,"was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to"
1598,that — that school — and came home every vacation with her
1599,"pockets full of frog spawn, turning teacups into rats. I was the only"
1600,one who saw her for what she was — a freak! But for my mother
1601,"and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of"
1602,having a witch in the family!”

1611,"“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the"
1612,Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill
1613,Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not

1618,“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.

1621,"no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’"

1634,does.”
1635,“Why not?”
1636,"“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is"
1637,"difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as"
1638,you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .”
1639,"Hagrid gulped, but no words came out."
1640,“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.
1641,“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid shud-
1642,"dered. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard,"
1643,"about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em,"
1644,"too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause"
1645,"he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t"

1647,THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
1648,"know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or"
1649,"witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course,"
1650,some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the
1651,only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only
1652,one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the
1653,"school, not jus’ then, anyway."
1654,"“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever"
1655,knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the mys-
1656,t’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side be-
1657,fore . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter
1658,want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.
1659,“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em . . . maybe he just
1660,"wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the"
1661,"village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You"
1662,was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ —”
1663,"Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief"
1664,and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.
1665,"“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’"
1666,nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway . . .
1667,“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real
1668,"myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a"
1669,"clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But"
1670,he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer
1671,forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a
1672,"powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad"
1673,"an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer"

1678,"of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you"
1679,"was only a baby, an’ you lived.”"
1680,Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Ha-
1681,"grid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green"
1682,"light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and"
1683,"he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high,"
1684,"cold, cruel laugh."
1685,Hagrid was watching him sadly.
1686,"“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s or-"
1687,ders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .”
1688,"“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had"
1689,almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon cer-
1690,tainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Ha-
1691,grid and his fists were clenched.
1692,"“Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there’s some-"
1693,"thing strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t"
1694,"have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were"
1695,"weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in"
1696,"my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these"
1697,"wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come"
1698,to a sticky end —”
1699,"But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a bat-"
1700,tered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle
1701,"Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m"
1702,warning you — one more word . . .”
1703,In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a
1704,"bearded giant, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened"
1705,himself against the wall and fell silent.

1707,THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS
1708,"“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back"
1709,"down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor."
1710,"Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them."
1711,"“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-"
1712,Who?”
1713,"“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he"
1714,tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest
1715,"myst’ry, see . . . he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d"
1716,he go?
1717,"“Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he"
1718,"had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there,"
1719,"bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his"
1720,side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances.
1721,Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.
1722,“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his
1723,powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished
1724,"him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t"
1725,"counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’"
1726,"about you stumped him, all right.”"
1727,Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his
1728,"eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure"
1729,there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he
1730,"possibly be? He’d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bul-"
1731,"lied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard,"
1732,why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d
1733,tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the great-
1734,"est sorcerer in the world, how come Dudley had always been able"
1735,to kick him around like a football?
1736,  57  
1737,CHAPTER FOUR
1738,"“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mis-"
1739,take. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”
1740,"To his surprise, Hagrid chuckled."
1741,"“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was"
1742,scared or angry?”
1743,Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . .
1744,every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with
1745,"him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . ."
1746,"chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of"
1747,their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous hair-
1748,"cut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time"
1749,"Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his revenge, without even realiz-"
1750,ing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?
1751,"Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was"
1752,positively beaming at him.
1753,"“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait,"
1754,you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”
1755,But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.
1756,“Haven’t I told you he’s not going?” he hissed. “He’s going
1757,to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those let-
1758,ters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands
1759,and —”
1760,"“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,”"
1761,growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hog-
1762,warts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s
1763,off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world.

1769,“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL
1770,TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
1771,But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and
1772,"whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— IN-"
1773,SULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT —
1774,OF — ME!”
1775,He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to
1776,"point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a"
1777,"firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was danc-"
1778,"ing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling"
1779,"in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s"
1780,tail poking through a hole in his trousers.
1781,Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the
1782,"other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed"
1783,the door behind them.
1784,Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.
1785,"“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work"
1786,"anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so"
1787,much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”
1788,He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
1789,"“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,”"
1790,"he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’."
1791,I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’
1792,stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —”
1793,“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.
1794,"“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got ex-"

1801,"“It’s gettin’ late and we’ve got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid"
1802,"loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an’ that.”"
1803,He took off his thick black coat and threw it to Harry.
1804,"“You can kip under that,” he said. “Don’ mind if it wriggles a"

1809,H          arry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell
1810,"it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight."
1811,"“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant"
1812,called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards.
1813,When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”
1814,There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.
1815,"And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his"
1816,heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a
1817,good dream.
1818,Tap. Tap. Tap.
1819,"“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”"
1820,He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The hut was full
1821,"of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the"
1822,"collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the win-"
1823,"dow, a newspaper held in its beak."
1824, 61  
1825,CHAPTER FIVE
1826,"Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large"
1827,balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight to the window
1828,and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspa-
1829,"per on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered"
1830,onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.
1831,“Don’t do that.”
1832,"Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its"
1833,beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.
1834,“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —”
1835,"“Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa."
1836,“What?”
1837,“He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.”
1838,Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets —
1839,"bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, peppermint humbugs,"
1840,"teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking"
1841,coins.
1842,"“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily."
1843,“Knuts?”
1844,“The little bronze ones.”
1845,"Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out"
1846,his leg so Harry could put the money into a small leather pouch
1847,tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.
1848,"Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched."
1849,"“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’"
1850,buy all yer stuff fer school.”
1851,Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them.
1852,He had just thought of something that made him feel as though
1853,the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.

1856,“Um — Hagrid?”
1857,"“Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots."
1858,“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last
1859,night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”
1860,"“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratch-"
1861,ing his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”
1862,“But if their house was destroyed —”
1863,"“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer"
1864,"us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad"
1865,"cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”"
1866,“Wizards have banks?”
1867,“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”
1868,Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.
1869,“Goblins?”
1870,"“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that."
1871,"Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the"
1872,world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hog-
1873,"warts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dum-"

1875,“He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you —
1876,"gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see."
1877,"“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”"
1878,Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite
1879,clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Ver-
1880,"non had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom af-"
1881,ter the storm.
1882,"“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for an-"
1883,other boat.
1884, 63  
1885,CHAPTER FIVE
1886,"“Flew,” said Hagrid."
1887,“Flew?”
1888,“Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic
1889,now I’ve got yeh.”
1890,"They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, try-"
1891,ing to imagine him flying.
1892,"“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry an-"
1893,other of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a
1894,"bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”"
1895,"“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid"
1896,"pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of"
1897,"the boat, and they sped off toward land."
1898,“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry
1899,asked.
1900,"“Spells — enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his news-"
1901,paper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-
1902,security vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is
1903,"hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Under-"
1904,"ground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did man-"
1905,age ter get yer hands on summat.”
1906,Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspa-
1907,"per, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that"
1908,"people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very dif-"
1909,"ficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life."
1910,"“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid mut-"
1911,"tered, turning the page."
1912,"“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could"
1913,stop himself.
1914,"“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minis-"
1915,  64  
1916,DIAGON ALLEY
1917,"ter, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius"
1918,Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dum-

1920,“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”
1921,"“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s"
1922,still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”
1923,“Why?”
1924,"“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to"
1925,"their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”"
1926,At this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall.
1927,"Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up the stone"
1928,steps onto the street.
1929,Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little
1930,town to the station. Harry couldn’t blame them. Not only was Ha-
1931,"grid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordi-"
1932,"nary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry?"
1933,"Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”"
1934,"“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did"
1935,you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”
1936,"“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”"
1937,“You’d like one?”
1938,“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”
1939,They had reached the station. There was a train to London
1940,"in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle"
1941,"money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their"
1942,tickets.
1943,People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two
1944,seats and sat knitting what looked like a canary-yellow circus tent.

1987,“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.
1988,"“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid."
1989,Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed
1990,"to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting"
1991,there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the
1992,"Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small"
1993,and the trains too slow.
1994,"“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said"
1995,as they climbed a broken-down escalator that led up to a bustling
1996,road lined with shops.
1997,Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry
1998, 67 
1999,CHAPTER FIVE
2000,had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and
2001,"music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere"
2002,that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an
2003,ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles
2004,of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really
2005,shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all
2006,be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry
2007,"hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might"
2008,"have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid"
2009,"had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting"
2010,him.
2011,"“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron."
2012,It’s a famous place.”
2013,"It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it"
2014,"out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying"
2015,by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one
2016,side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky
2017,"Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that"
2018,"only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Ha-"
2019,grid had steered him inside.
2020,"For a famous place, it was very dark and shabby. A few old"
2021,"women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. One"
2022,of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talk-
2023,"ing to the old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like a"
2024,toothless walnut. The low buzz of chatter stopped when they
2025,walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and
2026,"smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The"
2027,"usual, Hagrid?”"
2028, 68  
2029,DIAGON ALLEY
2030,"“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping"
2031,his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees
2032,buckle.
2033,"“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this —"
2034,can this be — ?”
2035,The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and
2036,silent.
2037,"“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . ."
2038,what an honor.”
2039,"He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and"
2040,"seized his hand, tears in his eyes."
2041,"“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”"
2042,Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him.
2043,The old woman with the pipe was puffing on it without realizing it
2044,had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.
2045,"Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment,"
2046,Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky
2047,Cauldron.
2048,"“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at"
2049,last.”
2050,"“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”"
2051,“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a flutter.”
2052,"“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name,"
2053,Dedalus Diggle.”
2054,"“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat"
2055,fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”
2056,"“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at"
2057,everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!”
2058,  69 
2059,CHAPTER FIVE
2060,Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept
2061,coming back for more.
2062,"A pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of"
2063,his eyes was twitching.
2064,"“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will"
2065,be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”
2066,"“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s"
2067,"hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”"
2068,"“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”"
2069,"“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor"
2070,"Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that"
2071,"you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be"
2072,"g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a"
2073,"new b-book on vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the"
2074,very thought.
2075,But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to
2076,himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At
2077,"last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble."
2078,"“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”"
2079,"Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid"
2080,"led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard,"
2081,where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.
2082,Hagrid grinned at Harry.
2083,"“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor"
2084,"Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually trem-"
2085,blin’.”
2086,“Is he always that nervous?”
2087,"“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was"
2088, 70  
2089,DIAGON ALLEY
2090,studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some first-
2091,"hand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest,"
2092,and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the
2093,"same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject —"
2094,"now, where’s me umbrella?”"
2095,"Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, mean-"
2096,"while, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can."
2097,"“Three up . . . two across . . .” he muttered. “Right, stand back,"
2098,Harry.”
2099,He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.
2100,The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the
2101,"middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a sec-"
2102,ond later they were facing an archway large enough even for Ha-
2103,"grid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out"
2104,of sight.
2105,"“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”"
2106,He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the
2107,archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the arch-
2108,way shrink instantly back into solid wall.
2109,The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the near-
2110,"est shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Sil-"
2111,"ver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them."
2112,"“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer"
2113,money first.”
2114,Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head
2115,"in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at"
2116,"everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people"
2117,doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was
2118,  71  
2119,CHAPTER FIVE
2120,"shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen"
2121,"Sickles an ounce, they’re mad."
2122,"A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying"
2123,"Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and"
2124,Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed
2125,"against a window with broomsticks in it. “Look,” Harry heard one"
2126,"of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —”"
2127,"There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange"
2128,"silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked"
2129,"with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell"
2130,"books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the"
2131,moon. . . .
2132,"“Gringotts,” said Hagrid."
2133,They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the
2134,"other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors,"
2135,"wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold, was —"
2136,"“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the"
2137,white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter
2138,"than Harry. He had a swarthy, clever face, a pointed beard and,"
2139,"Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked"
2140,"inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, silver this"
2141,"time, with words engraved upon them:"
2142,"Enter, stranger, but take heed"
2143,"Of what awaits the sin of greed,"
2144,"For those who take, but do not earn,"
2145,Must pay most dearly in their turn.
2146,So if you seek beneath our floors
2147,"A treasure that was never yours,"
2148, 72  
2149,DIAGON ALLEY
2150,"Thief, you have been warned, beware"
2151,Of finding more than treasure there.
2152,"“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid."
2153,A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they
2154,were in a vast marble hall. About a hundred more goblins were sit-
2155,"ting on high stools behind a long counter, scribbling in large"
2156,"ledgers, weighing coins in brass scales, examining precious stones"
2157,through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off
2158,"the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of"
2159,these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.
2160,"“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take"
2161,some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”
2162,"“You have his key, sir?”"
2163,"“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying"
2164,"his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of moldy dog"
2165,biscuits over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his
2166,nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of ru-
2167,bies as big as glowing coals.
2168,"“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key."
2169,The goblin looked at it closely.
2170,“That seems to be in order.”
2171,"“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said"
2172,"Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-"
2173,Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”
2174,The goblin read the letter carefully.
2175,"“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have"
2176,someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”
2177,Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed
2178,  73  
2179,CHAPTER FIVE
2180,"all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed"
2181,Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.
2182,“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thir-
2183,teen?” Harry asked.
2184,"“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret."
2185,Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s
2186,worth ter tell yeh that.”
2187,"Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had ex-"
2188,"pected more marble, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone"
2189,passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply down-
2190,ward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook
2191,whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the tracks toward
2192,them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and
2193,were off.
2194,At first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passages.
2195,"Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right,"
2196,"left, but it was impossible. The rattling cart seemed to know its"
2197,"own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering."
2198,"Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept"
2199,"them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end"
2200,"of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too"
2201,"late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake"
2202,where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew from the ceiling and
2203,floor.
2204,"“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the"
2205,"cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”"
2206,"“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me"
2207,"questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”"
2208,  74  
2209,DIAGON ALLEY
2210,"He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside"
2211,"a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean"
2212,against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.
2213,Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billow-
2214,"ing out, and as it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds of"
2215,gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.
2216,"“All yours,” smiled Hagrid."
2217,All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have
2218,known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blink-
2219,ing. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them
2220,to keep? And all the time there had been a small fortune belonging
2221,"to him, buried deep under London."
2222,Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.
2223,"“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver"
2224,"Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s"
2225,"easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms,"
2226,we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault
2227,"seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more"
2228,slowly?”
2229,"“One speed only,” said Griphook."
2230,They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air
2231,became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They
2232,"went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over"
2233,"the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Ha-"
2234,grid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck.
2235,Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
2236,"“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door"
2237,gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.
2238,  75  
2239,CHAPTER FIVE
2240,"“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked"
2241,"through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook."
2242,“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.
2243,"“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty"
2244,grin.
2245,Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security
2246,"vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to"
2247,see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was
2248,empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in
2249,brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it
2250,"deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew"
2251,better than to ask.
2252,"“Come on, back in this infernal cart, and don’t talk to me on the"
2253,"way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid."
2254,One wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside
2255,Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a
2256,bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons
2257,there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money
2258,than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley
2259,had ever had.
2260,"“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward"
2261,"Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would"
2262,yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron?
2263,"I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry"
2264,"entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous."
2265,"Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in"
2266,mauve.
2267, 76  
2268,DIAGON ALLEY
2269,"“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got"
2270,"the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in"
2271,fact.”
2272,"In the back of the shop, a boy with a pale, pointed face was"
2273,standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long
2274,"black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry on a stool next to him,"
2275,"slipped a long robe over his head, and began to pin it to the right"
2276,length.
2277,"“Hello,” said the boy, “Hogwarts, too?”"
2278,"“Yes,” said Harry."
2279,“My father’s next door buying my books and mother’s up the
2280,"street looking at wands,” said the boy. He had a bored, drawling"
2281,voice. “Then I’m going to drag them off to look at racing brooms.
2282,I don’t see why first years can’t have their own. I think I’ll bully fa-
2283,ther into getting me one and I’ll smuggle it in somehow.”
2284,Harry was strongly reminded of Dudley.
2285,“Have you got your own broom?” the boy went on.
2286,"“No,” said Harry."
2287,“Play Quidditch at all?”
2288,"“No,” Harry said again, wondering what on earth Quidditch"
2289,could be.
2290,“I do — Father says it’s a crime if I’m not picked to play for
2291,"my House, and I must say, I agree. Know what House you’ll be in"
2292,yet?”
2293,"“No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by the minute."
2294,"“Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I"
2295,"know I’ll be in Slytherin, all our family have been — imagine be-"
2296,"ing in Hufflepuff, I think I’d leave, wouldn’t you?”"
2297, 77  
2298,CHAPTER FIVE
2299,"“Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something a bit more"
2300,interesting.
2301,"“I say, look at that man!” said the boy suddenly, nodding toward"
2302,"the front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning at Harry"
2303,and pointing at two large ice creams to show he couldn’t come in.
2304,"“That’s Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased to know something the boy"
2305,didn’t. “He works at Hogwarts.”
2306,"“Oh,” said the boy, “I’ve heard of him. He’s a sort of servant,"
2307,isn’t he?”
2308,"“He’s the gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking the boy less"
2309,and less every second.
2310,"“Yes, exactly. I heard he’s a sort of savage — lives in a hut on the"
2311,"school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries to do"
2312,"magic, and ends up setting fire to his bed.”"
2313,"“I think he’s brilliant,” said Harry coldly."
2314,"“Do you?” said the boy, with a slight sneer. “Why is he with you?"
2315,Where are your parents?”
2316,"“They’re dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn’t feel much like go-"
2317,ing into the matter with this boy.
2318,"“Oh, sorry,” said the other, not sounding sorry at all. “But they"
2319,"were our kind, weren’t they?”"
2320,"“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”"
2321,"“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you?"
2322,"They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know"
2323,our ways. Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until
2324,"they get the letter, imagine. I think they should keep it in the old"
2325,"wizarding families. What’s your surname, anyway?”"
2326,"But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That’s"
2327, 78  
2328,DIAGON ALLEY
2329,"you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry for an excuse to stop talk-"
2330,"ing to the boy, hopped down from the footstool."
2331,"“Well, I’ll see you at Hogwarts, I suppose,” said the drawling"
2332,boy.
2333,Harry was rather quiet as he ate the ice cream Hagrid had
2334,bought him (chocolate and raspberry with chopped nuts).
2335,“What’s up?” said Hagrid.
2336,"“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy parchment and"
2337,quills. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that
2338,"changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said,"
2339,"“Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”"
2340,"“Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin’ how little yeh know — not"
2341,knowin’ about Quidditch!”
2342,"“Don’t make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid about"
2343,the pale boy in Madam Malkin’s.
2344,“— and he said people from Muggle families shouldn’t even be
2345,allowed in —”
2346,“Yer not from a Muggle family. If he’d known who yeh were —
2347,he’s grown up knowin’ yer name if his parents are wizardin’ folk.
2348,You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they
2349,"saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know about it, some o’ the best I"
2350,ever saw were the only ones with magic in ’em in a long line o’
2351,Muggles — look at yer mum! Look what she had fer a sister!”
2352,“So what is Quidditch?”
2353,“It’s our sport. Wizard sport. It’s like — like soccer in the
2354,Muggle world — everyone follows Quidditch — played up in the
2355,air on broomsticks and there’s four balls — sorta hard ter explain
2356,the rules.”
2357, 79 
2358,CHAPTER FIVE
2359,“And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
2360,“School Houses. There’s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot
2361,"o’ duffers, but —”"
2362,"“I bet I’m in Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily."
2363,"“Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There’s"
2364,not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin.
2365,You-Know-Who was one.”
2366,"“Vol-, sorry — You-Know-Who was at Hogwarts?”"
2367,"“Years an’ years ago,” said Hagrid."
2368,They bought Harry’s school books in a shop called Flourish and
2369,Blotts where the shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as
2370,large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage
2371,stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few
2372,"books with nothing in them at all. Even Dudley, who never read"
2373,"anything, would have been wild to get his hands on some of these."
2374,Hagrid almost had to drag Harry away from Curses and Counter-
2375,curses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies with the
2376,"Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much"
2377,More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
2378,“I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley.”
2379,"“I’m not sayin’ that’s not a good idea, but yer not ter use magic"
2380,"in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances,” said"
2381,"Hagrid. “An’ anyway, yeh couldn’ work any of them curses yet,"
2382,yeh’ll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level.”
2383,"Hagrid wouldn’t let Harry buy a solid gold cauldron, either (“It"
2384,"says pewter on yer list”), but they got a nice set of scales for weigh-"
2385,ing potion ingredients and a collapsible brass telescope. Then they
2386,"visited the Apothecary, which was fascinating enough to make up"
2387, 80  
2388,DIAGON ALLEY
2389,"for its horrible smell, a mixture of bad eggs and rotted cabbages."
2390,"Barrels of slimy stuff stood on the floor; jars of herbs, dried roots,"
2391,"and bright powders lined the walls; bundles of feathers, strings of"
2392,"fangs, and snarled claws hung from the ceiling. While Hagrid"
2393,asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic po-
2394,"tion ingredients for Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn"
2395,"horns at twenty-one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery-black"
2396,beetle eyes (five Knuts a scoop).
2397,"Outside the Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry’s list again."
2398,"“Just yer wand left — oh yeah, an’ I still haven’t got yeh a birth-"
2399,day present.”
2400,Harry felt himself go red.
2401,“You don’t have to —”
2402,"“I know I don’t have to. Tell yeh what, I’ll get yer animal. Not a"
2403,"toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh’d be laughed at — an’"
2404,"I don’ like cats, they make me sneeze. I’ll get yer an owl. All the kids"
2405,"want owls, they’re dead useful, carry yer mail an’ everythin’.”"
2406,"Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which"
2407,"had been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes."
2408,"Harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast"
2409,asleep with her head under her wing. He couldn’t stop stammering
2410,"his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell."
2411,"“Don’ mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don’ expect you’ve had"
2412,a lotta presents from them Dursleys. Just Ollivanders left now —
2413,"only place fer wands, Ollivanders, and yeh gotta have the best"
2414,wand.”
2415,A magic wand . . . this was what Harry had been really looking
2416,forward to.

2418,CHAPTER FIVE
2419,The last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over
2420,the door read Ollivanders: Makers of Fine Wands since 382 b.c. A
2421,single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window.
2422,A tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they
2423,"stepped inside. It was a tiny place, empty except for a single,"
2424,spindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as
2425,though he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of
2426,new questions that had just occurred to him and looked instead at
2427,the thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling.
2428,"For some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and"
2429,silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic.
2430,"“Good afternoon,” said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid"
2431,"must have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise"
2432,and he got quickly off the spindly chair.
2433,"An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shin-"
2434,ing like moons through the gloom of the shop.
2435,"“Hello,” said Harry awkwardly."
2436,"“Ah yes,” said the man. “Yes, yes. I thought I’d be seeing you"
2437,soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn’t a question. “You have your mother’s
2438,"eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first"
2439,"wand. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice"
2440,wand for charm work.”
2441,Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry. Harry wished he would
2442,blink. Those silvery eyes were a bit creepy.
2443,"“Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wand."
2444,Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for trans-
2445,"figuration. Well, I say your father favored it — it’s really the wand"
2446,"that chooses the wizard, of course.”"
2447, 82  
2448,DIAGON ALLEY
2449,Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost
2450,nose to nose. Harry could see himself reflected in those misty eyes.
2451,“And that’s where . . .”
2452,Mr. Ollivander touched the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead
2453,"with a long, white finger."
2454,"“I’m sorry to say I sold the wand that did it,” he said softly."
2455,"“Thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful,"
2456,"and in the wrong hands . . . well, if I’d known what that wand was"
2457,going out into the world to do. . . .”
2458,"He shook his head and then, to Harry’s relief, spotted Hagrid."
2459,"“Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak,"
2460,"sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn’t it?”"
2461,"“It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid."
2462,"“Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half"
2463,"when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern."
2464,"“Er — yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I’ve"
2465,"still got the pieces, though,” he added brightly."
2466,“But you don’t use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
2467,"“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his"
2468,pink umbrella very tightly as he spoke.
2469,"“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a piercing look."
2470,"“Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape mea-"
2471,sure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand
2472,arm?”
2473,"“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry."
2474,“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoul-
2475,"der to finger, then wrist to elbow, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit"
2476,"and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander"
2477, 83 
2478,CHAPTER FIVE
2479,"wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We"
2480,"use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and the heartstrings of"
2481,"dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two"
2482,"unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course,"
2483,you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”
2484,"Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was mea-"
2485,"suring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own. Mr. Olli-"
2486,"vander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes."
2487,"“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure crumpled into a"
2488,"heap on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beech-"
2489,wood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just
2490,take it and give it a wave.”
2491,"Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit,"
2492,but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.
2493,“Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy.
2494,Try —”
2495,"Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too,"
2496,was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
2497,"“No, no — here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and a half"
2498,"inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”"
2499,Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was
2500,waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and
2501,"higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander"
2502,"pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become."
2503,"“Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match"
2504,"here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual"
2505,"combination — holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and"
2506,supple.”
2507,  84  
2508,DIAGON ALLEY
2509,Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers.
2510,"He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down"
2511,through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from
2512,"the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the"
2513,"walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried,"
2514,"“Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how"
2515,curious . . . how very curious . . .”
2516,He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown
2517,"paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .”"
2518,"“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”"
2519,Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale stare.
2520,"“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single"
2521,wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your
2522,"wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious in-"
2523,deed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother —
2524,"why, its brother gave you that scar.”"
2525,Harry swallowed.
2526,"“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these"
2527,"things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I"
2528,"think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After"
2529,"all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible,"
2530,"yes, but great.”"
2531,Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too
2532,"much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Olli-"
2533,vander bowed them from his shop.
2534,The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid
2535,"made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall,"
2536,  85  
2537,CHAPTER FIVE
2538,"back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak"
2539,at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how
2540,"much people were gawking at them on the Underground, laden as"
2541,"they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl"
2542,"asleep in its cage on Harry’s lap. Up another escalator, out into"
2543,Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Ha-
2544,grid tapped him on the shoulder.
2545,"“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said."
2546,He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic
2547,seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so
2548,"strange, somehow."
2549,"“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid."
2550,Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birth-
2551,"day of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to"
2552,find the words.
2553,"“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in"
2554,"the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I"
2555,don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great
2556,things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for.
2557,"I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night"
2558,my parents died.”
2559,Hagrid leaned across the table. Behind the wild beard and eye-
2560,brows he wore a very kind smile.
2561,"“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone"
2562,"starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yer-"
2563,"self. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard."
2564,"But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smat-"

2568,Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back
2569,"to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope."
2570,"“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September — King’s"
2571,"Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys,"
2572,"send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See"
2573,"yeh soon, Harry.”"
2574,The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Ha-
2575,grid until he was out of sight; he rose in his seat and pressed his
2576,"nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone."

2581,AND THREE-QUARTERS
2582,"H         arry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True,"
2583,Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in
2584,"the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut"
2585,"Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at"
2586,"him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half"
2587,"furious, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were"
2588,"empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did be-"
2589,come a bit depressing after a while.
2590,"Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had"
2591,"decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of"
2592,Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed
2593,"reading late into the night, Hedwig swooping in and out of the"
2594,open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t
2595,"come in to vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back"

2600,"another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, count-"
2601,ing down to September the first.
2602,On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his
2603,"aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day,"
2604,so he went down to the living room where they were watching a
2605,quiz show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he
2606,"was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room."
2607,“Er — Uncle Vernon?”
2608,Uncle Vernon grunted to show he was listening.
2609,“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to
2610,Hogwarts.”
2611,Uncle Vernon grunted again.
2612,“Would it be all right if you gave me a lift?”
2613,Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
2614,“Thank you.”
2615,He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually
2616,spoke.
2617,"“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets"
2618,"all got punctures, have they?”"
2619,Harry didn’t say anything.
2620,"“Where is this school, anyway?”"
2621,"“I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He"
2622,pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.
2623,“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at
2624,"eleven o’clock,” he read."
2625,His aunt and uncle stared.
2626,“Platform what?”
2627,“Nine and three-quarters.”
2628,  89 
2629,CHAPTER SIX
2630,"“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform"
2631,nine and three-quarters.”
2632,“It’s on my ticket.”
2633,"“Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, the lot of them."
2634,"You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross."
2635,"We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t"
2636,bother.”
2637,"“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep"
2638,things friendly.
2639,"“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got"
2640,to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”
2641,Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited
2642,and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans
2643,because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s
2644,robes — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet
2645,"again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig"
2646,"was shut safely in her cage, and then paced the room, waiting for"
2647,"the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy trunk"
2648,"had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked"
2649,"Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off."
2650,They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon
2651,dumped Harry’s trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station
2652,for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon
2653,"stopped dead, facing the platforms with a nasty grin on his face."
2654,"“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your"
2655,"platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem"
2656,"to have built it yet, do they?”"
2657, 90  
2658,THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM
2659,NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
2660,"He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number"
2661,nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one
2662,"next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all."
2663,"“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even nastier"
2664,smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the
2665,Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s
2666,mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was
2667,"starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d"
2668,have to ask someone.
2669,"He stopped a passing guard, but didn’t dare mention platform"
2670,nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts
2671,and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it
2672,"was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stu-"
2673,"pid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that"
2674,"left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end"
2675,"the guard strode away, muttering about time wasters. Harry was"
2676,now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the
2677,"arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hog-"
2678,warts and he had no idea how to do it; he was stranded in the mid-
2679,"dle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of"
2680,"wizard money, and a large owl."
2681,Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to
2682,"do, like tapping the third brick on the left to get into Diagon Alley."
2683,He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the
2684,ticket inspector’s stand between platforms nine and ten.
2685,At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and
2686,he caught a few words of what they were saying.
2687,"“— packed with Muggles, of course —”"
2688, 91  
2689,CHAPTER SIX
2690,Harry swung round. The speaker was a plump woman who was
2691,"talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was"
2692,pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an
2693,owl.
2694,"Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They"
2695,"stopped and so did he, just near enough to hear what they were say-"
2696,ing.
2697,"“Now, what’s the platform number?” said the boys’ mother."
2698,"“Nine and three-quarters!” piped a small girl, also red-headed,"
2699,"who was holding her hand, “Mom, can’t I go . . .”"
2700,"“You’re not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy,"
2701,you go first.”
2702,What looked like the oldest boy marched toward platforms nine
2703,"and ten. Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it —"
2704,but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two
2705,"platforms, a large crowd of tourists came swarming in front of him"
2706,"and by the time the last backpack had cleared away, the boy had"
2707,vanished.
2708,"“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said."
2709,"“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman,"
2710,you call yourself our mother? Can’t you tell I’m George?”
2711,"“Sorry, George, dear.”"
2712,"“Only joking, I am Fred,” said the boy, and off he went. His"
2713,"twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, be-"
2714,"cause a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it?"
2715,Now the third brother was walking briskly toward the barrier —
2716,"he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t any-"
2717,where.

2721,There was nothing else for it.
2722,"“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman."
2723,"“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts? Ron’s new, too.”"
2724,"She pointed at the last and youngest of her sons. He was tall,"
2725,"thin, and gangling, with freckles, big hands and feet, and a long"
2726,nose.
2727,"“Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is — the thing is, I don’t know"
2728,how to —”
2729,"“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry"
2730,nodded.
2731,"“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at"
2732,the barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be
2733,"scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit"
2734,"of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”"
2735,"“Er — okay,” said Harry."
2736,He pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier. It looked
2737,very solid.
2738,He started to walk toward it. People jostled him on their way to
2739,platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going
2740,to smash right into that barrier and then he’d be in trouble — lean-
2741,"ing forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier"
2742,was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop —
2743,the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his
2744,eyes ready for the crash —
2745,It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.
2746,A scarlet steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed
2747,"with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven"
2748,o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a wrought-iron archway
2749,  93  
2750,CHAPTER SIX
2751,"where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and"
2752,Three-Quarters on it. He had done it.
2753,Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering
2754,"crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between"
2755,their legs. Owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way
2756,over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks.
2757,"The first few carriages were already packed with students, some"
2758,"hanging out of the window to talk to their families, some fighting"
2759,over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of
2760,"an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying,"
2761,"“Gran, I’ve lost my toad again.”"
2762,"“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh."
2763,A boy with dreadlocks was surrounded by a small crowd.
2764,"“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”"
2765,"The boy lifted the lid of a box in his arms, and the people"
2766,around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a
2767,"long, hairy leg."
2768,Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty
2769,compartment near the end of the train. He put Hedwig inside first
2770,and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train
2771,door. He tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end
2772,and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot.
2773,“Want a hand?” It was one of the red-haired twins he’d followed
2774,through the barrier.
2775,"“Yes, please,” Harry panted."
2776,"“Oy, Fred! C’mere and help!”"
2777,"With the twins’ help, Harry’s trunk was at last tucked away in a"
2778,corner of the compartment.

2784,Harry’s lightning scar.
2785,"“Blimey,” said the other twin. “Are you — ?”"
2786,"“He is,” said the first twin. “Aren’t you?” he added to Harry."
2787,“What?” said Harry.
2788,"“Harry Potter,” chorused the twins."
2789,"“Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”"
2790,"The two boys gawked at him, and Harry felt himself turning"
2791,"red. Then, to his relief, a voice came floating in through the train’s"
2792,open door.
2793,“Fred? George? Are you there?”
2794,"“Coming, Mom.”"
2795,"With a last look at Harry, the twins hopped off the train."
2796,"Harry sat down next to the window where, half hidden, he"
2797,could watch the red-haired family on the platform and hear what
2798,they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handker-
2799,chief.
2800,"“Ron, you’ve got something on your nose.”"
2801,"The youngest boy tried to jerk out of the way, but she grabbed"
2802,him and began rubbing the end of his nose.
2803,“Mom — geroff.” He wriggled free.
2804,"“Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie?” said one of"
2805,the twins.
2806,"“Shut up,” said Ron."
2807,“Where’s Percy?” said their mother.
2808,“He’s coming now.”
2809,The oldest boy came striding into sight. He had already changed
2810, 95 
2811,CHAPTER SIX
2812,"into his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed a shiny"
2813,red and gold badge on his chest with the letter P on it.
2814,"“Can’t stay long, Mother,” he said. “I’m up front, the prefects"
2815,have got two compartments to themselves —”
2816,"“Oh, are you a prefect, Percy?” said one of the twins, with an air"
2817,"of great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no"
2818,idea.”
2819,"“Hang on, I think I remember him saying something about it,”"
2820,said the other twin. “Once —”
2821,“Or twice —”
2822,“A minute —”
2823,“All summer —”
2824,"“Oh, shut up,” said Percy the Prefect."
2825,"“How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one of the"
2826,twins.
2827,"“Because he’s a prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear,"
2828,"well, have a good term — send me an owl when you get there.”"
2829,She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the
2830,twins.
2831,"“Now, you two — this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one"
2832,more owl telling me you’ve — you’ve blown up a toilet or —”
2833,“Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”
2834,"“Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”"
2835,“It’s not funny. And look after Ron.”
2836,"“Don’t worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe with us.”"
2837,"“Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost as tall as the twins al-"
2838,ready and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
2839,"“Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met on the train?”"

2842,NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
2843,Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn’t see him looking.
2844,“You know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station?
2845,Know who he is?”
2846,“Who?”
2847,“Harry Potter!”
2848,Harry heard the little girl’s voice.
2849,"“Oh, Mom, can I go on the train and see him, Mom, oh"
2850,please. . . .”
2851,"“You’ve already seen him, Ginny, and the poor boy isn’t some-"
2852,"thing you goggle at in a zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”"
2853,“Asked him. Saw his scar. It’s really there — like lightning.”
2854,"“Poor dear — no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever"
2855,so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform.”
2856,"“Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-"
2857,Who looks like?”
2858,Their mother suddenly became very stern.
2859,"“I forbid you to ask him, Fred. No, don’t you dare. As though he"
2860,needs reminding of that on his first day at school.”
2861,"“All right, keep your hair on.”"
2862,A whistle sounded.
2863,"“Hurry up!” their mother said, and the three boys clambered"
2864,onto the train. They leaned out of the window for her to kiss them
2865,"good-bye, and their younger sister began to cry."
2866,"“Don’t, Ginny, we’ll send you loads of owls.”"
2867,“We’ll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat.”
2868,“George!”
2869,"“Only joking, Mom.”"
2870,The train began to move. Harry saw the boys’ mother waving
2871, 97   
2872,CHAPTER SIX
2873,"and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running to keep up with"
2874,"the train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and"
2875,waved.
2876,Harry watched the girl and her mother disappear as the train
2877,rounded the corner. Houses flashed past the window. Harry felt a
2878,great leap of excitement. He didn’t know what he was going to —
2879,but it had to be better than what he was leaving behind.
2880,The door of the compartment slid open and the youngest red-
2881,headed boy came in.
2882,"“Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing at the seat opposite"
2883,Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”
2884,Harry shook his head and the boy sat down. He glanced at
2885,"Harry and then looked quickly out of the window, pretending he"
2886,hadn’t looked. Harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose.
2887,"“Hey, Ron.”"
2888,The twins were back.
2889,"“Listen, we’re going down the middle of the train — Lee Jor-"
2890,dan’s got a giant tarantula down there.”
2891,"“Right,” mumbled Ron."
2892,"“Harry,” said the other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred"
2893,"and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later,"
2894,then.”
2895,"“Bye,” said Harry and Ron. The twins slid the compartment"
2896,door shut behind them.
2897,“Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
2898,Harry nodded.
2899,"“Oh — well, I thought it might be one of Fred and George’s"
2900,"jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got — you know . . .”"

2904,He pointed at Harry’s forehead.
2905,Harry pulled back his bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron
2906,stared.
2907,“So that’s where You-Know-Who — ?”
2908,"“Yes,” said Harry, “but I can’t remember it.”"
2909,“Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
2910,"“Well — I remember a lot of green light, but nothing else.”"
2911,"“Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared at Harry for a few moments,"
2912,"then, as though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he"
2913,looked quickly out of the window again.
2914,"“Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just"
2915,as interesting as Ron found him.
2916,"“Er — yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom’s got a second"
2917,"cousin who’s an accountant, but we never talk about him.”"
2918,“So you must know loads of magic already.”
2919,The Weasleys were clearly one of those old wizarding families
2920,the pale boy in Diagon Alley had talked about.
2921,"“I heard you went to live with Muggles,” said Ron. “What are"
2922,they like?”
2923,"“Horrible — well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and"
2924,"cousin are, though. Wish I’d had three wizard brothers.”"
2925,"“Five,” said Ron. For some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I’m"
2926,the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I’ve got a
2927,lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left — Bill was head
2928,boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy’s a prefect.
2929,"Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good"
2930,marks and everyone thinks they’re really funny. Everyone expects
2931,"me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it’s no big deal, because"
2932,  99  
2933,CHAPTER SIX
2934,"they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five broth-"
2935,"ers. I’ve got Bill’s old robes, Charlie’s old wand, and Percy’s old rat.”"
2936,"Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out a fat gray rat, which"
2937,was asleep.
2938,"“His name’s Scabbers and he’s useless, he hardly ever wakes up."
2939,"Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect, but they"
2940,"couldn’t aff— I mean, I got Scabbers instead.”"
2941,"Ron’s ears went pink. He seemed to think he’d said too much,"
2942,because he went back to staring out of the window.
2943,Harry didn’t think there was anything wrong with not being
2944,"able to afford an owl. After all, he’d never had any money in his life"
2945,"until a month ago, and he told Ron so, all about having to wear"
2946,Dudley’s old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents.
2947,This seemed to cheer Ron up.
2948,"“. . . and until Hagrid told me, I didn’t know anything about be-"
2949,ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort —”
2950,Ron gasped.
2951,“What?” said Harry.
2952,"“You said You-Know-Who’s name!” said Ron, sounding both"
2953,"shocked and impressed. “I’d have thought you, of all people —”"
2954,"“I’m not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name,” said"
2955,"Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn’t. See what I mean? I’ve got"
2956,"loads to learn. . . . I bet,” he added, voicing for the first time some-"
2957,"thing that had been worrying him a lot lately, “I bet I’m the worst"
2958,in the class.”
2959,“You won’t be. There’s loads of people who come from Muggle
2960,families and they learn quick enough.”
2961,"While they had been talking, the train had carried them out"
2962,of London. Now they were speeding past fields full of cows and
2963, 100    
2964,THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM
2965,NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
2966,"sheep. They were quiet for a time, watching the fields and lanes"
2967,flick past.
2968,Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in
2969,"the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door"
2970,"and said, “Anything off the cart, dears?”"
2971,"Harry, who hadn’t had any breakfast, leapt to his feet, but Ron’s"
2972,ears went pink again and he muttered that he’d brought sand-
2973,wiches. Harry went out into the corridor.
2974,"He had never had any money for candy with the Dursleys, and"
2975,now that he had pockets rattling with gold and silver he was ready
2976,to buy as many Mars Bars as he could carry — but the woman
2977,didn’t have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bertie Bott’s Every
2978,"Flavor Beans, Drooble’s Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs,"
2979,"Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and a number"
2980,of other strange things Harry had never seen in his life. Not want-
2981,"ing to miss anything, he got some of everything and paid the"
2982,woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
2983,Ron stared as Harry brought it all back in to the compartment
2984,and tipped it onto an empty seat.
2985,"“Hungry, are you?”"
2986,"“Starving,” said Harry, taking a large bite out of a pumpkin"
2987,pasty.
2988,Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There
2989,"were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said,"
2990,“She always forgets I don’t like corned beef.”
2991,"“Swap you for one of these,” said Harry, holding up a pasty. “Go"
2992,on —”
2993,"“You don’t want this, it’s all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn’t got much"
2994,"time,” he added quickly, “you know, with five of us.”"
2995,  101   
2996,CHAPTER SIX
2997,"“Go on, have a pasty,” said Harry, who had never had any-"
2998,"thing to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with. It was"
2999,"a nice feeling, sitting there with Ron, eating their way through"
3000,"all Harry’s pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay for-"
3001,gotten).
3002,"“What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up a pack of"
3003,"Chocolate Frogs. “They’re not really frogs, are they?” He was start-"
3004,ing to feel that nothing would surprise him.
3005,"“No,” said Ron. “But see what the card is. I’m missing Agrippa.”"
3006,“What?”
3007,"“Oh, of course, you wouldn’t know — Chocolate Frogs have"
3008,"cards inside them, you know, to collect — famous witches and"
3009,"wizards. I’ve got about five hundred, but I haven’t got Agrippa or"
3010,Ptolemy.”
3011,Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up the card. It
3012,"showed a man’s face. He wore half-moon glasses, had a long,"
3013,"crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Under-"
3014,neath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.
3015,“So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.
3016,“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron.
3017,“Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”
3018,Harry turned over his card and read:
3019,ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
3020,currently headmaster of hogwarts
3021,"Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,"
3022,Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the
3023, 102  
3024,THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM
3025,NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
3026,"Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the"
3027,"twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy"
3028,"with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore"
3029,enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
3030,"Harry turned the card back over and saw, to his astonishment, that"
3031,Dumbledore’s face had disappeared.
3032,“He’s gone!”
3033,"“Well, you can’t expect him to hang around all day,” said Ron."
3034,"“He’ll be back. No, I’ve got Morgana again and I’ve got about six"
3035,of her . . . do you want it? You can start collecting.”
3036,Ron’s eyes strayed to the pile of Chocolate Frogs waiting to be
3037,unwrapped.
3038,"“Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, the Muggle"
3039,"world, people just stay put in photos.”"
3040,"“Do they? What, they don’t move at all?” Ron sounded amazed."
3041,“Weird !”
3042,Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his
3043,card and gave him a small smile. Ron was more interested in eating
3044,"the frogs than looking at the Famous Witches and Wizards cards,"
3045,but Harry couldn’t keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only
3046,"Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist of Woodcraft, Alberic"
3047,"Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes"
3048,"away from the druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, to"
3049,open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.
3050,"“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When"
3051,"they say every flavor, they mean every flavor — you know, you get"
3052,all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar-
3053, 103   
3054,CHAPTER SIX
3055,"malade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George"
3056,reckons he had a booger-flavored one once.”
3057,"Ron picked up a green bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a"
3058,corner.
3059,“Bleaaargh — see? Sprouts.”
3060,They had a good time eating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got
3061,"toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine,"
3062,and was even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one
3063,"Ron wouldn’t touch, which turned out to be pepper."
3064,The countryside now flying past the window was becoming
3065,"wilder. The neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting"
3066,"rivers, and dark green hills."
3067,There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the
3068,round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform nine and three-
3069,quarters came in. He looked tearful.
3070,"“Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen a toad at all?”"
3071,"When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I’ve lost him! He"
3072,keeps getting away from me!”
3073,"“He’ll turn up,” said Harry."
3074,"“Yes,” said the boy miserably. “Well, if you see him . . .”"
3075,He left.
3076,"“Don’t know why he’s so bothered,” said Ron. “If I’d brought a"
3077,"toad I’d lose it as quick as I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers,"
3078,so I can’t talk.”
3079,The rat was still snoozing on Ron’s lap.
3080,"“He might have died and you wouldn’t know the difference,” said"
3081,Ron in disgust. “I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him
3082,"more interesting, but the spell didn’t work. I’ll show you, look . . .”"

3086,He rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very
3087,battered-looking wand. It was chipped in places and something
3088,white was glinting at the end.
3089,“Unicorn hair’s nearly poking out. Anyway —”
3090,He had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid
3091,"open again. The toadless boy was back, but this time he had a girl"
3092,with him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
3093,"“Has anyone seen a toad? Neville’s lost one,” she said. She had a"
3094,"bossy sort of voice, lots of bushy brown hair, and rather large front"
3095,teeth.
3096,"“We’ve already told him we haven’t seen it,” said Ron, but the"
3097,"girl wasn’t listening, she was looking at the wand in his hand."
3098,"“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.”"
3099,She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.
3100,“Er — all right.”
3101,He cleared his throat.
3102,"“Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,"
3103,"Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”"
3104,"He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed"
3105,gray and fast asleep.
3106,"“Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very"
3107,"good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all"
3108,"worked for me. Nobody in my family’s magic at all, it was ever such"
3109,"a surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, of course,"
3110,"I mean, it’s the very best school of witchcraft there is, I’ve heard —"
3111,"I’ve learned all our course books by heart, of course, I just hope it"
3112, 105    
3113,CHAPTER SIX
3114,"will be enough — I’m Hermione Granger, by the way, who are"
3115,you?”
3116,She said all this very fast.
3117,"Harry looked at Ron, and was relieved to see by his stunned face"
3118,that he hadn’t learned all the course books by heart either.
3119,"“I’m Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered."
3120,"“Harry Potter,” said Harry."
3121,"“Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all about you, of"
3122,"course — I got a few extra books for background reading, and"
3123,you’re in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark
3124,Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century.”
3125,"“Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed."
3126,"“Goodness, didn’t you know, I’d have found out everything I"
3127,"could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either of you know what"
3128,"House you’ll be in? I’ve been asking around, and I hope I’m in"
3129,"Gryffindor, it sounds by far the best; I hear Dumbledore himself"
3130,"was in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn’t be too bad. . . . Any-"
3131,"way, we’d better go and look for Neville’s toad. You two had better"
3132,"change, you know, I expect we’ll be there soon.”"
3133,"And she left, taking the toadless boy with her."
3134,"“Whatever House I’m in, I hope she’s not in it,” said Ron. He"
3135,threw his wand back into his trunk. “Stupid spell — George gave
3136,"it to me, bet he knew it was a dud.”"
3137,“What House are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
3138,"“Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed to be settling on him"
3139,"again. “Mom and Dad were in it, too. I don’t know what they’ll say"
3140,"if I’m not. I don’t suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imag-"
3141,ine if they put me in Slytherin.”

3145,"“That’s the House Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”"
3146,"“Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back into his seat, looking de-"
3147,pressed.
3148,"“You know, I think the ends of Scabbers’ whiskers are a bit"
3149,"lighter,” said Harry, trying to take Ron’s mind off Houses. “So"
3150,"what do your oldest brothers do now that they’ve left, anyway?”"
3151,Harry was wondering what a wizard did once he’d finished
3152,school.
3153,"“Charlie’s in Romania studying dragons, and Bill’s in Africa do-"
3154,"ing something for Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear about"
3155,"Gringotts? It’s been all over the Daily Prophet, but I don’t suppose"
3156,you get that with the Muggles — someone tried to rob a high se-
3157,curity vault.”
3158,Harry stared.
3159,“Really? What happened to them?”
3160,"“Nothing, that’s why it’s such big news. They haven’t been"
3161,caught. My dad says it must’ve been a powerful Dark wizard to get
3162,"round Gringotts, but they don’t think they took anything, that’s"
3163,"what’s odd. ’Course, everyone gets scared when something like this"
3164,happens in case You-Know-Who’s behind it.”
3165,Harry turned this news over in his mind. He was starting to
3166,get a prickle of fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned.
3167,"He supposed this was all part of entering the magical world, but"
3168,it had been a lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without
3169,worrying.
3170,“What’s your Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
3171,"“Er — I don’t know any,” Harry confessed."
3172,"“What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it’s the best"

3176,"four balls and the positions of the seven players, describing famous"
3177,games he’d been to with his brothers and the broomstick he’d like
3178,to get if he had the money. He was just taking Harry through the
3179,finer points of the game when the compartment door slid open yet
3180,"again, but it wasn’t Neville the toadless boy, or Hermione Granger"
3181,this time.
3182,"Three boys entered, and Harry recognized the middle one at"
3183,once: It was the pale boy from Madam Malkin’s robe shop. He was
3184,looking at Harry with a lot more interest than he’d shown back in
3185,Diagon Alley.
3186,“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that
3187,"Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”"
3188,"“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of"
3189,them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing on either
3190,"side of the pale boy, they looked like bodyguards."
3191,"“Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said the pale boy care-"
3192,"lessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my names Malfoy,"
3193,Draco Malfoy.”
3194,"Ron gave a slight cough, which might have been hiding a snig-"
3195,ger. Draco Malfoy looked at him.
3196,"“Think my name’s funny, do you? No need to ask who you are."
3197,"My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more"
3198,children than they can afford.”
3199,He turned back to Harry. “You’ll soon find out some wizarding
3200,"families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go"
3201,making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”
3202,"He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it."

3206,"“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he"
3207,said coolly.
3208,"Draco Malfoy didn’t go red, but a pink tinge appeared in his pale"
3209,cheeks.
3210,"“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless"
3211,you’re a bit politer you’ll go the same way as your parents. They
3212,"didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with"
3213,"riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll rub off on you.”"
3214,Both Harry and Ron stood up.
3215,"“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair."
3216,"“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered."
3217,"“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt,"
3218,because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
3219,"“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our"
3220,food and you still seem to have some.”
3221,Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron
3222,"leapt forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let"
3223,out a horrible yell.
3224,"Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk"
3225,deep into Goyle’s knuckle — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as
3226,"Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scab-"
3227,"bers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disap-"
3228,peared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking
3229,"among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a sec-"
3230,"ond later, Hermione Granger had come in."
3231,"“What has been going on?” she said, looking at the sweets all"
3232,over the floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
3233,"“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked"
3234,  109  
3235,CHAPTER SIX
3236,closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to
3237,sleep.”
3238,And so he had.
3239,“You’ve met Malfoy before?”
3240,Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.
3241,"“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of"
3242,the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disap-
3243,peared. Said they’d been bewitched. My dad doesn’t believe it. He
3244,says Malfoy’s father didn’t need an excuse to go over to the Dark
3245,Side.” He turned to Hermione. “Can we help you with some-
3246,thing?”
3247,"“You’d better hurry up and put your robes on, I’ve just been up"
3248,"to the front to ask the conductor, and he says we’re nearly there."
3249,"You haven’t been fighting, have you? You’ll be in trouble before we"
3250,even get there!”
3251,"“Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling at her."
3252,“Would you mind leaving while we change?”
3253,“All right — I only came in here because people outside are be-
3254,"having very childishly, racing up and down the corridors,” said"
3255,"Hermione in a sniffy voice. “And you’ve got dirt on your nose, by"
3256,"the way, did you know?”"
3257,Ron glared at her as she left. Harry peered out of the window. It
3258,was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under a deep
3259,purple sky. The train did seem to be slowing down.
3260,He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled on their long black
3261,"robes. Ron’s were a bit short for him, you could see his sneakers un-"
3262,derneath them.
3263,A voice echoed through the train: “We will be reaching Hog-
3264,  110  
3265,THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM
3266,NINE AND THREE-QUARTERS
3267,"warts in five minutes’ time. Please leave your luggage on the train,"
3268,it will be taken to the school separately.”
3269,"Harry’s stomach lurched with nerves and Ron, he saw, looked"
3270,pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets with the last
3271,of the sweets and joined the crowd thronging the corridor.
3272,The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed
3273,"their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform."
3274,Harry shivered in the cold night air. Then a lamp came bobbing
3275,"over the heads of the students, and Harry heard a familiar voice:"
3276,"“Firs’ years! Firs’ years over here! All right there, Harry?”"
3277,Hagrid’s big hairy face beamed over the sea of heads.
3278,"“C’mon, follow me — any more firs’ years? Mind yer step, now!"
3279,Firs’ years follow me!”
3280,"Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what"
3281,"seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of"
3282,them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody
3283,"spoke much. Neville, the boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed"
3284,once or twice.
3285,"“Yeh’ll get yer firs’ sight o’ Hogwarts in a sec,” Hagrid called over"
3286,"his shoulder, “jus’ round this bend here.”"
3287,There was a loud “Oooooh!”
3288,The narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great
3289,"black lake. Perched atop a high mountain on the other side, its"
3290,"windows sparkling in the starry sky, was a vast castle with many"
3291,turrets and towers.
3292,"“No more’n four to a boat!” Hagrid called, pointing to a fleet of"
3293,little boats sitting in the water by the shore. Harry and Ron were
3294,followed into their boat by Neville and Hermione.
3295, 111  
3296,CHAPTER SIX
3297,"“Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had a boat to himself."
3298,“Right then — FORWARD!”
3299,"And the fleet of little boats moved off all at once, gliding across"
3300,"the lake, which was as smooth as glass. Everyone was silent, staring"
3301,up at the great castle overhead. It towered over them as they sailed
3302,nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
3303,“Heads down!” yelled Hagrid as the first boats reached the cliff;
3304,they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a
3305,curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were
3306,"carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to be taking them right"
3307,"underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground"
3308,"harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles."
3309,"“Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was check-"
3310,ing the boats as people climbed out of them.
3311,"“Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then"
3312,"they clambered up a passageway in the rock after Hagrid’s lamp,"
3313,"coming out at last onto smooth, damp grass right in the shadow of"
3314,the castle.
3315,They walked up a flight of stone steps and crowded around the
3316,"huge, oak front door."
3317,"“Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”"
3318,Hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three times on the cas-
3319,tle door.
3320, 112   

3322,THE SORTING HAT
3323,"T      he door swung open at once. A tall, black-haired witch in"
3324,emerald-green robes stood there. She had a very stern face
3325,and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.
3326,"“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid."
3327,"“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”"
3328,She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you
3329,could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone
3330,"walls were lit with flaming torches like the ones at Gringotts, the"
3331,"ceiling was too high to make out, and a magnificent marble stair-"
3332,case facing them led to the upper floors.
3333,They followed Professor McGonagall across the flagged stone
3334,floor. Harry could hear the drone of hundreds of voices from a
3335,doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be
3336,here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a
3337,"small, empty chamber off the hall. They crowded in, standing"
3338, 113 
3339,CHAPTER SEVEN
3340,"rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering"
3341,about nervously.
3342,"“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The"
3343,"start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your"
3344,"seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your Houses. The"
3345,"Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here,"
3346,your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts.
3347,"You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your"
3348,"House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common"
3349,room.
3350,"“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,"
3351,and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has
3352,produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hog-
3353,"warts, your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-"
3354,"breaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House"
3355,"with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I"
3356,hope each of you will be a credit to whichever House becomes
3357,yours.
3358,“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front
3359,of the rest of the school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as
3360,much as you can while you are waiting.”
3361,"Her eyes lingered for a moment on Neville’s cloak, which was"
3362,"fastened under his left ear, and on Ron’s smudged nose. Harry ner-"
3363,vously tried to flatten his hair.
3364,"“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor Mc-"
3365,Gonagall. “Please wait quietly.”
3366,She left the chamber. Harry swallowed.
3367,“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.
3368, 114  
3369,THE SORTING HAT
3370,"“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he"
3371,was joking.”
3372,Harry’s heart gave a horrible jolt. A test? In front of the whole
3373,school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would
3374,he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment
3375,they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone
3376,"else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except"
3377,"Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the"
3378,spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry
3379,"tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous,"
3380,"never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the"
3381,Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers wig blue.
3382,"He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor"
3383,McGonagall would come back and lead him to his doom.
3384,Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in
3385,the air — several people behind him screamed.
3386,“What the — ?”
3387,He gasped. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts
3388,had just streamed through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly
3389,"transparent, they glided across the room talking to one another and"
3390,hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What
3391,"looked like a fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say,"
3392,we ought to give him a second chance —”
3393,"“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he de-"
3394,"serves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really"
3395,"even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?”"
3396,A ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first
3397,years.
3398, 115   
3399,CHAPTER SEVEN
3400,Nobody answered.
3401,"“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them."
3402,"“About to be Sorted, I suppose?”"
3403,A few people nodded mutely.
3404,"“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House,"
3405,you know.”
3406,"“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s"
3407,about to start.”
3408,"Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts"
3409,floated away through the opposite wall.
3410,"“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years,"
3411,“and follow me.”
3412,"Feeling oddly as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got"
3413,"into line behind a boy with sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and"
3414,"they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through"
3415,a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
3416,Harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid
3417,place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were
3418,"floating in midair over four long tables, where the rest of the stu-"
3419,dents were sitting. These tables were laid with glittering golden
3420,plates and goblets. At the top of the hall was another long table
3421,where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first
3422,"years up here, so that they came to a halt in a line facing the other"
3423,"students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces"
3424,staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the flickering candle-
3425,"light. Dotted here and there among the students, the ghosts shone"
3426,"misty silver. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked up-"
3427,ward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard
3428, 116   
3429,THE SORTING HAT
3430,"Hermione whisper, “It’s bewitched to look like the sky outside. I"
3431,"read about it in Hogwarts, A History.”"
3432,"It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the"
3433,Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the heavens.
3434,Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall
3435,silently placed a four-legged stool in front of the first years. On top
3436,of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was patched
3437,and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in
3438,the house.
3439,"Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought"
3440,"wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in"
3441,"the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few"
3442,"seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat twitched. A rip"
3443,near the brim opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to
3444,sing:
3445,"“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty,"
3446,"But don’t judge on what you see,"
3447,I’ll eat myself if you can find
3448,A smarter hat than me.
3449,"You can keep your bowlers black,"
3450,"Your top hats sleek and tall,"
3451,For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
3452,And I can cap them all.
3453,There’s nothing hidden in your head
3454,"The Sorting Hat can’t see,"
3455,So try me on and I will tell you
3456,Where you ought to be.
3457, 117   
3458,CHAPTER SEVEN
3459,"You might belong in Gryffindor,"
3460,"Where dwell the brave at heart,"
3461,"Their daring, nerve, and chivalry"
3462,Set Gryffindors apart;
3463,"You might belong in Hufflepuff,"
3464,"Where they are just and loyal,"
3465,Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
3466,And unafraid of toil;
3467,"Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,"
3468,"If you’ve a ready mind,"
3469,"Where those of wit and learning,"
3470,Will always find their kind;
3471,Or perhaps in Slytherin
3472,"You’ll make your real friends,"
3473,Those cunning folk use any means
3474,To achieve their ends.
3475,So put me on! Don’t be afraid !
3476,And don’t get in a flap!
3477,You’re in safe hands (though I have none)
3478,For I’m a Thinking Cap!”
3479,The whole hall burst into applause as the hat finished its song. It
3480,bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.
3481,“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry.
3482,"“I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about wrestling a troll.”"
3483,"Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than"
3484,"having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on"
3485,without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a
3486, 118  
3487,THE SORTING HAT
3488,lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-witted or any of it at the mo-
3489,ment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a
3490,"bit queasy, that would have been the one for him."
3491,Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll
3492,of parchment.
3493,"“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the"
3494,"stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”"
3495,"A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails stumbled out of line, put"
3496,"on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A"
3497,moment’s pause —
3498,“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.
3499,The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to
3500,sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat
3501,Friar waving merrily at her.
3502,"“Bones, Susan!”"
3503,"“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off"
3504,to sit next to Hannah.
3505,"“Boot, Terry!”"
3506,“RAVENCLAW!”
3507,The table second from the left clapped this time; several Raven-
3508,claws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.
3509,"“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown,"
3510,"Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far"
3511,left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers cat-
3512,calling.
3513,"“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was"
3514,"Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he"
3515,thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.
3516, 119 
3517,CHAPTER SEVEN
3518,He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered be-
3519,ing picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always
3520,"been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no"
3521,one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.
3522,"“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”"
3523,“HUFFLEPUFF!”
3524,"Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at"
3525,"once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Sea-"
3526,"mus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the"
3527,stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a
3528,Gryffindor.
3529,"“Granger, Hermione!”"
3530,Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on
3531,her head.
3532,“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.
3533,"A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do"
3534,when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if
3535,"he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor"
3536,McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously
3537,been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?
3538,"When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad,"
3539,"was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a"
3540,"long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted,"
3541,"“GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog"
3542,"back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”"
3543,Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got
3544,his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it
3545,"screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”"
3546,  120  
3547,THE SORTING HAT
3548,"Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking"
3549,pleased with himself.
3550,There weren’t many people left now.
3551,"“Moon” . . . , “Nott” . . . , “Parkinson” . . . , then a pair of twin"
3552,"girls, “Patil” and “Patil” . . . , then “Perks, Sally-Anne” . . . , and"
3553,"then, at last —"
3554,"“Potter, Harry!”"
3555,"As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like lit-"
3556,tle hissing fires all over the hall.
3557,"“Potter, did she say?”"
3558,“The Harry Potter?”
3559,The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes
3560,was the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him. Next
3561,second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.
3562,"“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult."
3563,"Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh"
3564,"my goodness, yes — and a nice thirst to prove yourself, now that’s"
3565,interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?”
3566,"Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin,"
3567,not Slytherin.
3568,"“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You"
3569,"could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin"
3570,"will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no?"
3571,"Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”"
3572,Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He
3573,took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table.
3574,"He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he"
3575,hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the

3577,CHAPTER SEVEN
3578,"Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley"
3579,"twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down op-"
3580,posite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his
3581,"arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it"
3582,into a bucket of ice-cold water.
3583,He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest
3584,"him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up."
3585,"Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in"
3586,"a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at"
3587,once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the
3588,train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall
3589,that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quir-
3590,"rell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was"
3591,looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.
3592,"And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas,"
3593,"Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the"
3594,"Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it"
3595,was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fin-
3596,"gers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted,"
3597,“GRYFFINDOR!”
3598,Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the
3599,chair next to him.
3600,"“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously"
3601,"across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor"
3602,McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.
3603,Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just
3604,realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages
3605,ago.
3606, 122  
3607,THE SORTING HAT
3608,Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at
3609,"the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have"
3610,pleased him more than to see them all there.
3611,“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Be-
3612,"fore we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And"
3613,here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
3614,“Thank you!”
3615,He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t
3616,know whether to laugh or not.
3617,“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.
3618,“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the
3619,"world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”"
3620,Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now
3621,piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat
3622,"on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops,"
3623,"sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries,"
3624,"Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some"
3625,"strange reason, peppermint humbugs."
3626,"The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never"
3627,been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken
3628,"anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry"
3629,piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and
3630,began to eat. It was all delicious.
3631,"“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching"
3632,Harry cut up his steak.
3633,“Can’t you — ?”
3634,"“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I"
3635,"don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve in-"

3638,troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your ser-
3639,vice. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”
3640,“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me
3641,about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”
3642,“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the
3643,"ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted."
3644,“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”
3645,"Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t"
3646,going at all the way he wanted.
3647,"“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His"
3648,whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was
3649,"on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not"
3650,done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their
3651,"faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck,"
3652,"coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to"
3653,help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have
3654,never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six
3655,years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbear-
3656,able — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”
3657,Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost
3658,"sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained"
3659,"with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was"
3660,"pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements."
3661,“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great in-
3662,terest.
3663,"“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately."
3664,"When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of"
3665,"the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as be-"

3668,fore. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in
3669,"every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate"
3670,"éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pud-"
3671,ding . . .
3672,"As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their"
3673,families.
3674,"“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom"
3675,didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a
3676,nasty shock for him.”
3677,The others laughed.
3678,"“What about you, Neville?” said Ron."
3679,"“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville,"
3680,“but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle
3681,Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic
3682,"out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I"
3683,nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great
3684,"Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of"
3685,an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid of-
3686,fered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced —
3687,all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really
3688,"pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have"
3689,seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be
3690,"magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased"
3691,he bought me my toad.”
3692,"On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talk-"
3693,"ing about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much"
3694,"to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know,"
3695,"turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to"

3697,CHAPTER SEVEN
3698,"be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into"
3699,needles and that sort of thing —”).
3700,"Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at"
3701,the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet.
3702,Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Pro-
3703,"fessor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with"
3704,"greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin."
3705,It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past
3706,"Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain"
3707,shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.
3708,“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.
3709,“What is it?” asked Percy.
3710,“N-nothing.”
3711,The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off
3712,was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feel-
3713,ing that he didn’t like Harry at all.
3714,“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked
3715,Percy.
3716,"“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s look-"
3717,"ing so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he"
3718,doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows
3719,"an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”"
3720,"Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him"
3721,again.
3722,"At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore"
3723,got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.
3724,“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and wa-
3725,tered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.
3726, 126    
3727,THE SORTING HAT
3728,“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbid-
3729,den to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to
3730,remember that as well.”
3731,Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the
3732,Weasley twins.
3733,"“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind"
3734,you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corri-
3735,dors.
3736,“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term.
3737,Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact
3738,Madam Hooch.
3739,"“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corri-"
3740,dor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does
3741,not wish to die a very painful death.”
3742,"Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did."
3743,“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.
3744,"“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd,"
3745,because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go
3746,"somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows"
3747,"that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”"
3748,"“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!”"
3749,cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles
3750,had become rather fixed.
3751,"Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get"
3752,"a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose"
3753,"high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words."
3754,"“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off"
3755,we go!”
3756, 127   
3757,CHAPTER SEVEN
3758,And the school bellowed:
3759,"“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,"
3760,"Teach us something please,"
3761,Whether we be old and bald
3762,"Or young with scabby knees,"
3763,Our heads could do with filling
3764,"With some interesting stuff,"
3765,"For now they’re bare and full of air,"
3766,"Dead flies and bits of fluff,"
3767,"So teach us things worth knowing,"
3768,"Bring back what we’ve forgot,"
3769,"Just do your best, we’ll do the rest,"
3770,And learn until our brains all rot.”
3771,"Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the"
3772,Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march.
3773,Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and
3774,"when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest."
3775,"“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do"
3776,"here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”"
3777,The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering
3778,"crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s"
3779,"legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full"
3780,of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in
3781,the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they
3782,"passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden be-"
3783,hind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more
3784,  128    
3785,THE SORTING HAT
3786,"staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just"
3787,wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a
3788,sudden halt.
3789,"A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them,"
3790,and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing them-
3791,selves at him.
3792,"“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He"
3793,"raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”"
3794,"A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, an-"
3795,swered.
3796,“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”
3797,"There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a"
3798,"wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the"
3799,walking sticks.
3800,"“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What"
3801,fun!”
3802,He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.
3803,"“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!”"
3804,barked Percy.
3805,"Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking"
3806,"sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling"
3807,coats of armor as he passed.
3808,"“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off"
3809,"again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he"
3810,won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”
3811,At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat
3812,woman in a pink silk dress.
3813,“Password?” she said.
3814,  129  
3815,CHAPTER SEVEN
3816,"“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to"
3817,reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it —
3818,Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor
3819,"common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs."
3820,Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and
3821,the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they
3822,were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at
3823,"last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their"
3824,"trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they"
3825,pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.
3826,"“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hang-"
3827,"ings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”"
3828,"Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart,"
3829,but he fell asleep almost at once.
3830,"Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very"
3831,"strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which"
3832,"kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at"
3833,"once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t"
3834,want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull
3835,"it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing"
3836,at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the
3837,"hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold —"
3838,"there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and"
3839,shaking.
3840,"He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day,"
3841,he didn’t remember the dream at all.
3842, 130  
3843,CHAPTER EIGHT
3844,THE POTIONS MASTER
3845,"T      here, look.”"
3846,“Where?”
3847,“Next to the tall kid with the red hair.”
3848,“Wearing the glasses?”
3849,“Did you see his face?”
3850,“Did you see his scar?”
3851,Whispers followed Harry from the moment he left his dormi-
3852,tory the next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood on tip-
3853,"toe to get a look at him, or doubled back to pass him in the"
3854,"corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn’t, because he"
3855,was trying to concentrate on finding his way to classes.
3856,There were a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts:
3857,"wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led some-"
3858,where different on a Friday; some with a vanishing step halfway up
3859,that you had to remember to jump. Then there were doors that
3860, 131  
3861,CHAPTER EIGHT
3862,"wouldn’t open unless you asked politely, or tickled them in exactly"
3863,"the right place, and doors that weren’t really doors at all, but solid"
3864,walls just pretending. It was also very hard to remember where any-
3865,"thing was, because it all seemed to move around a lot. The people"
3866,"in the portraits kept going to visit each other, and Harry was sure"
3867,the coats of armor could walk.
3868,"The ghosts didn’t help, either. It was always a nasty shock when"
3869,one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying
3870,to open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy to point new
3871,"Gryffindors in the right direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist was"
3872,worth two locked doors and a trick staircase if you met him when
3873,you were late for class. He would drop wastepaper baskets on your
3874,"head, pull rugs from under your feet, pelt you with bits of chalk, or"
3875,"sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT"
3876,YOUR CONK!”
3877,"Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was the caretaker,"
3878,Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed to get on the wrong side of
3879,him on their very first morning. Filch found them trying to force
3880,their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the en-
3881,trance to the out-of-bounds corridor on the third floor. He
3882,"wouldn’t believe they were lost, was sure they were trying to break"
3883,"into it on purpose, and was threatening to lock them in the"
3884,"dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was"
3885,passing.
3886,"Filch owned a cat called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-colored"
3887,"creature with bulging, lamplike eyes just like Filch’s. She patrolled"
3888,"the corridors alone. Break a rule in front of her, put just one toe out"
3889,"of line, and she’d whisk off for Filch, who’d appear, wheezing, two"
3890, 132   
3891,THE POTIONS MASTER
3892,seconds later. Filch knew the secret passageways of the school bet-
3893,ter than anyone (except perhaps the Weasley twins) and could pop
3894,"up as suddenly as any of the ghosts. The students all hated him,"
3895,and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good
3896,kick.
3897,"And then, once you had managed to find them, there were the"
3898,"classes themselves. There was a lot more to magic, as Harry quickly"
3899,"found out, than waving your wand and saying a few funny words."
3900,They had to study the night skies through their telescopes every
3901,Wednesday at midnight and learn the names of different stars and
3902,the movements of the planets. Three times a week they went out to
3903,"the greenhouses behind the castle to study Herbology, with a"
3904,"dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how"
3905,"to take care of all the strange plants and fungi, and found out what"
3906,they were used for.
3907,"Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was"
3908,the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns had been very old
3909,indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and
3910,"got up next morning to teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns"
3911,"droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and"
3912,got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.
3913,"Professor Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tiny little wizard"
3914,who had to stand on a pile of books to see over his desk. At the start
3915,"of their first class he took the roll call, and when he reached Harry’s"
3916,name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight.
3917,Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite
3918,"right to think she wasn’t a teacher to cross. Strict and clever, she gave"
3919,them a talking-to the moment they sat down in her first class.
3920,  133    
3921,CHAPTER EIGHT
3922,“Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous
3923,"magic you will learn at Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing"
3924,around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been
3925,warned.”
3926,Then she changed her desk into a pig and back again. They were
3927,"all very impressed and couldn’t wait to get started, but soon realized"
3928,they weren’t going to be changing the furniture into animals for a
3929,"long time. After taking a lot of complicated notes, they were each"
3930,given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle. By the end
3931,"of the lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference to"
3932,her match; Professor McGonagall showed the class how it had gone
3933,all silver and pointy and gave Hermione a rare smile.
3934,The class everyone had really been looking forward to was De-
3935,"fense Against the Dark Arts, but Quirrell’s lessons turned out to be"
3936,"a bit of a joke. His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which"
3937,everyone said was to ward off a vampire he’d met in Romania and
3938,was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days. His
3939,"turban, he told them, had been given to him by an African prince"
3940,"as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome zombie, but they"
3941,"weren’t sure they believed this story. For one thing, when Seamus"
3942,Finnigan asked eagerly to hear how Quirrell had fought off the
3943,"zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather;"
3944,"for another, they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the"
3945,"turban, and the Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full of"
3946,"garlic as well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went."
3947,Harry was very relieved to find out that he wasn’t miles behind
3948,"everyone else. Lots of people had come from Muggle families and,"
3949,"like him, hadn’t had any idea that they were witches and wizards."
3950, 134  
3951,THE POTIONS MASTER
3952,There was so much to learn that even people like Ron didn’t have
3953,much of a head start.
3954,Friday was an important day for Harry and Ron. They finally
3955,managed to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast
3956,without getting lost once.
3957,“What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar
3958,on his porridge.
3959,"“Double Potions with the Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape’s Head"
3960,of Slytherin House. They say he always favors them — we’ll be able
3961,to see if it’s true.”
3962,"“Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGona-"
3963,"gall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn’t stopped her from"
3964,giving them a huge pile of homework the day before.
3965,"Just then, the mail arrived. Harry had gotten used to this by"
3966,"now, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning,"
3967,when about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great
3968,"Hall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their own-"
3969,"ers, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps."
3970,Hedwig hadn’t brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes
3971,flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to
3972,"sleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, how-"
3973,"ever, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar"
3974,bowl and dropped a note onto Harry’s plate. Harry tore it open at
3975,"once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl:"
3976,"Dear Harry,"
3977,I know you get Friday afternoons off so would you like
3978,to come and have a cup of tea with me around three?
3979,  135   
3980,CHAPTER EIGHT
3981,I want to hear all about your first week. Send us an
3982,answer back with Hedwig.
3983,Hagrid
3984,"Harry borrowed Ron’s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on"
3985,"the back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again."
3986,"It was lucky that Harry had tea with Hagrid to look forward to,"
3987,because the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that
3988,had happened to him so far.
3989,"At the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that"
3990,"Professor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson,"
3991,he knew he’d been wrong. Snape didn’t dislike Harry — he hated
3992,him.
3993,Potions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was
3994,"colder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite"
3995,creepy enough without the pickled animals floating in glass jars all
3996,around the walls.
3997,"Snape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and"
3998,"like Flitwick, he paused at Harry’s name."
3999,"“Ah, yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new — celebrity.”"
4000,Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered be-
4001,hind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up
4002,"at the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid’s, but they had none of"
4003,Hagrid’s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think
4004,of dark tunnels.
4005,“You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-
4006,"making,” he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but"
4007,"they caught every word — like Professor McGonagall, Snape had"
4008, 136   
4009,THE POTIONS MASTER
4010,the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. “As there is little
4011,"foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is"
4012,magic. I don’t expect you will really understand the beauty of the
4013,"softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate"
4014,"power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the"
4015,"mind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame,"
4016,"brew glory, even stopper death — if you aren’t as big a bunch of"
4017,dunderheads as I usually have to teach.”
4018,More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron ex-
4019,changed looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the
4020,edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she
4021,wasn’t a dunderhead.
4022,“Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added
4023,powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?”
4024,Powdered root of what to an infusion of what? Harry glanced at
4025,"Ron, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione’s hand had shot"
4026,into the air.
4027,"“I don’t know, sir,” said Harry."
4028,Snape’s lips curled into a sneer.
4029,"“Tut, tut — fame clearly isn’t everything.”"
4030,He ignored Hermione’s hand.
4031,"“Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to"
4032,find me a bezoar?”
4033,Hermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go
4034,"without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn’t have the faintest idea"
4035,"what a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and"
4036,"Goyle, who were shaking with laughter."
4037,"“I don’t know, sir.”"
4038, 137   
4039,CHAPTER EIGHT
4040,"“Thought you wouldn’t open a book before coming, eh, Potter?”"
4041,Harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold
4042,"eyes. He had looked through his books at the Dursleys’, but did"
4043,Snape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Mag-
4044,ical Herbs and Fungi?
4045,Snape was still ignoring Hermione’s quivering hand.
4046,"“What is the difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfs-"
4047,bane?”
4048,"At this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the"
4049,dungeon ceiling.
4050,"“I don’t know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does,"
4051,"though, why don’t you try her?”"
4052,"A few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus’s eye, and Seamus"
4053,"winked. Snape, however, was not pleased."
4054,"“Sit down,” he snapped at Hermione. “For your information,"
4055,"Potter, asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so power-"
4056,ful it is known as the Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a stone
4057,taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most
4058,"poisons. As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant,"
4059,which also goes by the name of aconite. Well? Why aren’t you all
4060,copying that down?”
4061,There was a sudden rummaging for quills and parchment. Over
4062,"the noise, Snape said, “And a point will be taken from Gryffindor"
4063,"House for your cheek, Potter.”"
4064,Things didn’t improve for the Gryffindors as the Potions lesson
4065,continued. Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up
4066,a simple potion to cure boils. He swept around in his long black
4067,"cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs,"
4068, 138   
4069,THE POTIONS MASTER
4070,"criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to"
4071,like. He was just telling everyone to look at the perfect way Malfoy
4072,had stewed his horned slugs when clouds of acid green smoke and
4073,a loud hissing filled the dungeon. Neville had somehow managed
4074,"to melt Seamus’s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was"
4075,"seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people’s shoes."
4076,"Within seconds, the whole class was standing on their stools while"
4077,"Neville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron"
4078,"collapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sprang up all over his"
4079,arms and legs.
4080,"“Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing the spilled potion away with"
4081,one wave of his wand. “I suppose you added the porcupine quills
4082,before taking the cauldron off the fire?”
4083,Neville whimpered as boils started to pop up all over his nose.
4084,"“Take him up to the hospital wing,” Snape spat at Seamus. Then"
4085,"he rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to"
4086,Neville.
4087,“You — Potter — why didn’t you tell him not to add the quills?
4088,"Thought he’d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you?"
4089,That’s another point you’ve lost for Gryffindor.”
4090,"This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but"
4091,Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.
4092,"“Don’t push it,” he muttered, “I’ve heard Snape can turn very"
4093,nasty.”
4094,"As they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later,"
4095,Harry’s mind was racing and his spirits were low. He’d lost two
4096,points for Gryffindor in his very first week — why did Snape hate
4097,him so much?
4098, 139  
4099,CHAPTER EIGHT
4100,"“Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape’s always taking points off Fred and"
4101,George. Can I come and meet Hagrid with you?”
4102,At five to three they left the castle and made their way across the
4103,grounds. Hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the
4104,forbidden forest. A crossbow and a pair of galoshes were outside
4105,the front door.
4106,When Harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from in-
4107,"side and several booming barks. Then Hagrid’s voice rang out, say-"
4108,"ing, “Back, Fang — back.”"
4109,"Hagrid’s big, hairy face appeared in the crack as he pulled the"
4110,door open.
4111,"“Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”"
4112,"He let them in, struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an"
4113,enormous black boarhound.
4114,There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were
4115,"hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle was boiling on the open"
4116,"fire, and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt"
4117,over it.
4118,"“Make yerselves at home,” said Hagrid, letting go of Fang, who"
4119,"bounded straight at Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid,"
4120,Fang was clearly not as fierce as he looked.
4121,"“This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling wa-"
4122,ter into a large teapot and putting rock cakes onto a plate.
4123,"“Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing at Ron’s freckles."
4124,“I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.”
4125,The rock cakes were shapeless lumps with raisins that almost
4126,"broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be enjoying"
4127,them as they told Hagrid all about their first lessons. Fang rested
4128,his head on Harry’s knee and drooled all over his robes.
4129, 140   
4130,THE POTIONS MASTER
4131,Harry and Ron were delighted to hear Hagrid call Filch “that old
4132,git’’
4133,"“An’ as fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I’d like ter introduce her to"
4134,"Fang sometime. D’yeh know, every time I go up ter the school, she"
4135,follows me everywhere? Can’t get rid of her — Filch puts her up
4136,to it.”
4137,"Harry told Hagrid about Snape’s lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told"
4138,"Harry not to worry about it, that Snape liked hardly any of the stu-"
4139,dents.
4140,“But he seemed to really hate me.”
4141,“Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”
4142,Yet Harry couldn’t help thinking that Hagrid didn’t quite meet
4143,his eyes when he said that.
4144,“How’s yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him a
4145,lot — great with animals.”
4146,Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed the subject on purpose.
4147,"While Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie’s work with dragons,"
4148,Harry picked up a piece of paper that was lying on the table under
4149,the tea cozy. It was a cutting from the Daily Prophet:
4150,GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
4151,Investigations continue into the break-in at
4152,"Gringotts on 31 July, widely believed to be the"
4153,work of Dark wizards or witches unknown.
4154,Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing
4155,had been taken. The vault that was searched had in
4156,fact been emptied the same day.
4157,"“But we’re not telling you what was in there, so"
4158,keep your noses out if you know what’s good
4159,  141 
4160,CHAPTER EIGHT
4161,"for you,” said a Gringotts spokesgoblin this after-"
4162,noon.
4163,Harry remembered Ron telling him on the train that someone had
4164,"tried to rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn’t mentioned the date."
4165,"“Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break-in happened on my"
4166,birthday! It might’ve been happening while we were there!”
4167,"There was no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely didn’t meet"
4168,Harry’s eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock
4169,cake. Harry read the story again. The vault that was searched had in
4170,fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault
4171,"seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out"
4172,that grubby little package. Had that been what the thieves were
4173,looking for?
4174,"As Harry and Ron walked back to the castle for dinner, their"
4175,pockets weighed down with rock cakes they’d been too polite to
4176,"refuse, Harry thought that none of the lessons he’d had so far had"
4177,given him as much to think about as tea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid
4178,collected that package just in time? Where was it now? And did
4179,Hagrid know something about Snape that he didn’t want to tell
4180,Harry?
4181,  142  
4182,CHAPTER NINE
4183,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4184,H          arry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated
4185,"more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco"
4186,"Malfoy. Still, first-year Gryffindors only had Potions with the"
4187,"Slytherins, so they didn’t have to put up with Malfoy much. Or at"
4188,"least, they didn’t until they spotted a notice pinned up in the"
4189,Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying
4190,lessons would be starting on Thursday — and Gryffindor and
4191,Slytherin would be learning together.
4192,"“Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. To"
4193,make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy.”
4194,He had been looking forward to learning to fly more than any-
4195,thing else.
4196,"“You don’t know that you’ll make a fool of yourself,” said Ron"
4197,"reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy’s always going on about how"
4198,"good he is at Quidditch, but I bet that’s all talk.”"
4199, 143  
4200,CHAPTER NINE
4201,Malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot. He complained
4202,loudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch
4203,"teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed to end"
4204,with him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn’t the
4205,"only one, though: the way Seamus Finnigan told it, he’d spent most"
4206,of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broom-
4207,stick. Even Ron would tell anyone who’d listen about the time he’d
4208,almost hit a hang glider on Charlie’s old broom. Everyone from
4209,wizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had al-
4210,"ready had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their"
4211,"dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn’t see what was exciting about"
4212,a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry
4213,"had caught Ron prodding Dean’s poster of West Ham soccer team,"
4214,trying to make the players move.
4215,"Neville had never been on a broomstick in his life, because his"
4216,"grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she’d"
4217,"had good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordi-"
4218,nary number of accidents even with both feet on the ground.
4219,Hermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville
4220,was. This was something you couldn’t learn by heart out of a
4221,book — not that she hadn’t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she
4222,bored them all stupid with flying tips she’d gotten out of a library
4223,book called Quidditch Through the Ages. Neville was hanging on to
4224,"her every word, desperate for anything that might help him hang"
4225,"on to his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased"
4226,when Hermione’s lecture was interrupted by the arrival of the mail.
4227,"Harry hadn’t had a single letter since Hagrid’s note, something"
4228,"that Malfoy had been quick to notice, of course. Malfoy’s eagle owl"
4229,  144   
4230,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4231,"was always bringing him packages of sweets from home, which he"
4232,opened gloatingly at the Slytherin table.
4233,A barn owl brought Neville a small package from his grand-
4234,mother. He opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the
4235,"size of a large marble, which seemed to be full of white smoke."
4236,“It’s a Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget
4237,things — this tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten to do.
4238,"Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red — oh . . .” His"
4239,"face fell, because the Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet,"
4240,“. . . you’ve forgotten something . . .”
4241,Neville was trying to remember what he’d forgotten when Draco
4242,"Malfoy, who was passing the Gryffindor table, snatched the Re-"
4243,membrall out of his hand.
4244,Harry and Ron jumped to their feet. They were half hoping for
4245,"a reason to fight Malfoy, but Professor McGonagall, who could"
4246,"spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school, was there in a"
4247,flash.
4248,“What’s going on?”
4249,"“Malfoy’s got my Remembrall, Professor.”"
4250,"Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Remembrall back on the"
4251,table.
4252,"“Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away with Crabbe and"
4253,Goyle behind him.
4254,"At three-thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and the other Gryffin-"
4255,dors hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first
4256,"flying lesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under"
4257,their feet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a
4258, 145   
4259,CHAPTER NINE
4260,"smooth, flat lawn on the opposite side of the grounds to the for-"
4261,"bidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly in the distance."
4262,"The Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broom-"
4263,sticks lying in neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and
4264,"George Weasley complain about the school brooms, saying that"
4265,"some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew"
4266,slightly to the left.
4267,"Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair,"
4268,and yellow eyes like a hawk.
4269,"“Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone"
4270,"stand by a broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”"
4271,Harry glanced down at his broom. It was old and some of the
4272,twigs stuck out at odd angles.
4273,"“Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam"
4274,"Hooch at the front, “and say ‘Up!’ ”"
4275,“UP!” everyone shouted.
4276,"Harry’s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of"
4277,the few that did. Hermione Granger’s had simply rolled over on the
4278,"ground, and Neville’s hadn’t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like"
4279,"horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was"
4280,a quaver in Neville’s voice that said only too clearly that he wanted
4281,to keep his feet on the ground.
4282,Madam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms
4283,"without sliding off the end, and walked up and down the rows cor-"
4284,recting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told
4285,Malfoy he’d been doing it wrong for years.
4286,"“Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off from the ground,"
4287,"hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise a few"
4288, 146  
4289,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4290,"feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly."
4291,On my whistle — three — two —”
4292,"But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on"
4293,"the ground, pushed off hard before the whistle had touched"
4294,Madam Hooch’s lips.
4295,"“Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight"
4296,up like a cork shot out of a bottle — twelve feet — twenty feet.
4297,Harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling
4298,"away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off the broom and —"
4299,WHAM — a thud and a nasty crack and Neville lay facedown
4300,on the grass in a heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and
4301,"higher, and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and"
4302,out of sight.
4303,"Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face as white as"
4304,his.
4305,"“Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy — it’s"
4306,"all right, up you get.”"
4307,She turned to the rest of the class.
4308,“None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital
4309,wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you’ll be out of
4310,"Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.’ Come on, dear.”"
4311,"Neville, his face tear-streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off"
4312,"with Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him."
4313,No sooner were they out of earshot than Malfoy burst into
4314,laughter.
4315,"“Did you see his face, the great lump?”"
4316,The other Slytherins joined in.
4317,"“Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil."
4318, 147    
4319,CHAPTER NINE
4320,"“Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, a"
4321,hard-faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you’d like fat little cry-
4322,"babies, Parvati.”"
4323,"“Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something"
4324,out of the grass. “It’s that stupid thing Longbottom’s gran sent him.”
4325,The Remembrall glittered in the sun as he held it up.
4326,"“Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped"
4327,talking to watch.
4328,Malfoy smiled nastily.
4329,“I think I’ll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find — how
4330,about — up a tree?”
4331,"“Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his"
4332,"broomstick and taken off. He hadn’t been lying, he could fly well."
4333,"Hovering level with the topmost branches of an oak he called,"
4334,"“Come and get it, Potter!”"
4335,Harry grabbed his broom.
4336,“No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not
4337,to move — you’ll get us all into trouble.”
4338,Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding in his ears. He mounted
4339,"the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up, up he"
4340,"soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out be-"
4341,hind him — and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he’d found
4342,"something he could do without being taught — this was easy, this"
4343,was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even
4344,"higher, and heard screams and gasps of girls back on the ground and"
4345,an admiring whoop from Ron.
4346,He turned his broomstick sharply to face Malfoy in midair. Mal-
4347,foy looked stunned.
4348, 148   
4349,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4350,"“Give it here,” Harry called, “or I’ll knock you off that broom!”"
4351,"“Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried."
4352,"Harry knew, somehow, what to do. He leaned forward and"
4353,"grasped the broom tightly in both hands, and it shot toward Mal-"
4354,foy like a javelin. Malfoy only just got out of the way in time;
4355,Harry made a sharp about-face and held the broom steady. A few
4356,people below were clapping.
4357,"“No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck, Malfoy,”"
4358,Harry called.
4359,The same thought seemed to have struck Malfoy.
4360,"“Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw the glass"
4361,ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground.
4362,"Harry saw, as though in slow motion, the ball rise up in the air"
4363,and then start to fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom
4364,handle down — next second he was gathering speed in a steep
4365,"dive, racing the ball — wind whistled in his ears, mingled with the"
4366,screams of people watching — he stretched out his hand — a foot
4367,"from the ground he caught it, just in time to pull his broom"
4368,"straight, and he toppled gently onto the grass with the Remembrall"
4369,clutched safely in his fist.
4370,“HARRY POTTER!”
4371,His heart sank faster than he’d just dived. Professor McGonagall
4372,"was running toward them. He got to his feet, trembling."
4373,“Never — in all my time at Hogwarts —”
4374,"Professor McGonagall was almost speechless with shock, and"
4375,"her glasses flashed furiously, “— how dare you — might have bro-"

4380,"“Be quiet, Miss Patil —”"
4381,“But Malfoy —”
4382,"“That’s enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”"
4383,"Harry caught sight of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle’s triumphant"
4384,"faces as he left, walking numbly in Professor McGonagall’s wake as"
4385,"she strode toward the castle. He was going to be expelled, he just"
4386,"knew it. He wanted to say something to defend himself, but there"
4387,seemed to be something wrong with his voice. Professor McGona-
4388,gall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog
4389,to keep up. Now he’d done it. He hadn’t even lasted two weeks.
4390,He’d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys
4391,say when he turned up on the doorstep?
4392,"Up the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Pro-"
4393,fessor McGonagall didn’t say a word to him. She wrenched open
4394,doors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably
4395,behind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought
4396,"of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps"
4397,he could be Hagrid’s assistant. His stomach twisted as he imagined
4398,"it, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he"
4399,stumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid’s bag.
4400,Professor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened
4401,the door and poked her head inside.
4402,"“Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood for a mo-"
4403,ment?”
4404,"Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was go-"
4405,ing to use on him?
4406,"But Wood turned out to be a person, a burly fifth-year boy who"
4407,came out of Flitwick’s class looking confused.
4408, 150  
4409,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4410,"“Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they"
4411,"marched on up the corridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry."
4412,“In here.”
4413,Professor McGonagall pointed them into a classroom that was
4414,"empty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the"
4415,blackboard.
4416,"“Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin,"
4417,"which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor"
4418,McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the
4419,two boys.
4420,"“Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood — I’ve found you a Seeker.”"
4421,Wood’s expression changed from puzzlement to delight.
4422,"“Are you serious, Professor?”"
4423,"“Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy’s a"
4424,natural. I’ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on
4425,"a broomstick, Potter?”"
4426,"Harry nodded silently. He didn’t have a clue what was going on,"
4427,"but he didn’t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling"
4428,started coming back to his legs.
4429,"“He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,” Profes-"
4430,sor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn’t even scratch himself. Charlie
4431,Weasley couldn’t have done it.”
4432,Wood was now looking as though all his dreams had come true
4433,at once.
4434,"“Ever seen a game of Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly."
4435,"“Wood’s captain of the Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall"
4436,explained.
4437,"“He’s just the build for a Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking"
4438,  151   
4439,CHAPTER NINE
4440,around Harry and staring at him. “Light — speedy — we’ll have
4441,"to get him a decent broom, Professor — a Nimbus Two Thousand"
4442,"or a Cleansweep Seven, I’d say.”"
4443,“I shall speak to Professor Dumbledore and see if we can’t bend
4444,"the first-year rule. Heaven knows, we need a better team than last"
4445,"year. Flattened in that last match by Slytherin, I couldn’t look"
4446,Severus Snape in the face for weeks. . . .”
4447,Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses at Harry.
4448,"“I want to hear you’re training hard, Potter, or I may change my"
4449,mind about punishing you.”
4450,Then she suddenly smiled.
4451,"“Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an ex-"
4452,cellent Quidditch player himself.”
4453,“You’re joking.”
4454,It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had
4455,happened when he’d left the grounds with Professor McGonagall.
4456,"Ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth, but"
4457,he’d forgotten all about it.
4458,“Seeker?” he said. “But first years never — you must be the
4459,youngest House player in about —”
4460,"“— a century,” said Harry, shoveling pie into his mouth. He felt"
4461,particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon. “Wood
4462,told me.”
4463,"Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped at Harry."
4464,"“I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don’t tell anyone,"
4465,Wood wants to keep it a secret.”
4466,"Fred and George Weasley now came into the hall, spotted Harry,"
4467,and hurried over.
4468, 152  
4469,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4470,"“Well done,” said George in a low voice. “Wood told us. We’re"
4471,on the team too — Beaters.”
4472,"“I tell you, we’re going to win that Quidditch Cup for sure this"
4473,"year,” said Fred. “We haven’t won since Charlie left, but this year’s"
4474,"team is going to be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was"
4475,almost skipping when he told us.”
4476,"“Anyway, we’ve got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he’s found a new"
4477,secret passageway out of the school.”
4478,“Bet it’s that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that
4479,we found in our first week. See you.”
4480,Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less
4481,"welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle."
4482,"“Having a last meal, Potter? When are you getting the train back"
4483,to the Muggles?”
4484,“You’re a lot braver now that you’re back on the ground and
4485,"you’ve got your little friends with you,” said Harry coolly. There"
4486,"was of course nothing at all little about Crabbe and Goyle, but as"
4487,"the High Table was full of teachers, neither of them could do more"
4488,than crack their knuckles and scowl.
4489,"“I’d take you on anytime on my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if"
4490,you want. Wizard’s duel. Wands only — no contact. What’s the
4491,"matter? Never heard of a wizard’s duel before, I suppose?”"
4492,"“Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I’m his second,"
4493,who’s yours?”
4494,"Malfoy looked at Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up."
4495,"“Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We’ll meet you in the"
4496,trophy room; that’s always unlocked.”
4497,"When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked at each"
4498,other.
4499, 153  
4500,CHAPTER NINE
4501,"“What is a wizard’s duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean,"
4502,you’re my second?”
4503,"“Well, a second’s there to take over if you die,” said Ron casually,"
4504,getting started at last on his cold pie. Catching the look on Harry’s
4505,"face, he added quickly, “But people only die in proper duels, you"
4506,"know, with real wizards. The most you and Malfoy’ll be able to do"
4507,is send sparks at each other. Neither of you knows enough magic to
4508,"do any real damage. I bet he expected you to refuse, anyway.”"
4509,“And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”
4510,"“Throw it away and punch him on the nose,” Ron suggested."
4511,“Excuse me.
4512,They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
4513,“Can’t a person eat in peace in this place?” said Ron.
4514,Hermione ignored him and spoke to Harry.
4515,“I couldn’t help overhearing what you and Malfoy were
4516,saying —”
4517,"“Bet you could,” Ron muttered."
4518,"“— and you mustn’t go wandering around the school at night,"
4519,"think of the points you’ll lose Gryffindor if you’re caught, and"
4520,you’re bound to be. It’s really very selfish of you.”
4521,"“And it’s really none of your business,” said Harry."
4522,"“Good-bye,” said Ron."
4523,"All the same, it wasn’t what you’d call the perfect end to the day,"
4524,"Harry thought, as he lay awake much later listening to Dean and"
4525,Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn’t back from the hospital wing).
4526,Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such as “If he tries to
4527,"curse you, you’d better dodge it, because I can’t remember how to"
4528, 154   
4529,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4530,block them.” There was a very good chance they were going to get
4531,"caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his"
4532,"luck, breaking another school rule today. On the other hand, Mal-"
4533,foy’s sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness — this was
4534,his big chance to beat Malfoy face-to-face. He couldn’t miss it.
4535,"“Half-past eleven,” Ron muttered at last, “we’d better go.”"
4536,"They pulled on their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and"
4537,"crept across the tower room, down the spiral staircase, and into the"
4538,Gryffindor common room. A few embers were still glowing in the
4539,"fireplace, turning all the armchairs into hunched black shadows."
4540,They had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from
4541,"the chair nearest them, “I can’t believe you’re going to do this,"
4542,Harry.”
4543,"A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing a pink"
4544,bathrobe and a frown.
4545,“You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back to bed!”
4546,"“I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy — he’s"
4547,"a prefect, he’d put a stop to this.”"
4548,Harry couldn’t believe anyone could be so interfering.
4549,"“Come on,” he said to Ron. He pushed open the portrait of the"
4550,Fat Lady and climbed through the hole.
4551,Hermione wasn’t going to give up that easily. She followed Ron
4552,"through the portrait hole, hissing at them like an angry goose."
4553,"“Don’t you care about Gryffindor, do you only care about your-"
4554,"selves, I don’t want Slytherin to win the House Cup, and you’ll lose"
4555,all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about
4556,Switching Spells.”
4557,“Go away.”
4558,  155  
4559,CHAPTER NINE
4560,"“All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said"
4561,"when you’re on the train home tomorrow, you’re so —”"
4562,"But what they were, they didn’t find out. Hermione had turned"
4563,to the portrait of the Fat Lady to get back inside and found herself
4564,facing an empty painting. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime
4565,visit and Hermione was locked out of Gryffindor Tower.
4566,“Now what am I going to do?” she asked shrilly.
4567,"“That’s your problem,” said Ron. “We’ve got to go, we’re going"
4568,to be late.”
4569,They hadn’t even reached the end of the corridor when
4570,Hermione caught up with them.
4571,"“I’m coming with you,” she said."
4572,“You are not.”
4573,“D’you think I’m going to stand out here and wait for Filch to
4574,"catch me? If he finds all three of us I’ll tell him the truth, that I was"
4575,"trying to stop you, and you can back me up.”"
4576,“You’ve got some nerve —” said Ron loudly.
4577,"“Shut up, both of you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard something.”"
4578,It was a sort of snuffling.
4579,"“Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through the dark."
4580,It wasn’t Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up on the
4581,"floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake as they crept nearer."
4582,"“Thank goodness you found me! I’ve been out here for hours, I"
4583,couldn’t remember the new password to get in to bed.”
4584,"“Keep your voice down, Neville. The password’s ‘Pig snout’ but"
4585,"it won’t help you now, the Fat Lady’s gone off somewhere.”"
4586,“How’s your arm?” said Harry.
4587,"“Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended"
4588,it in about a minute.”
4589, 156  
4590,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4591,"“Good — well, look, Neville, we’ve got to be somewhere, we’ll"
4592,see you later —”
4593,"“Don’t leave me!” said Neville, scrambling to his feet, “I don’t"
4594,"want to stay here alone, the Bloody Baron’s been past twice al-"
4595,ready.”
4596,Ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at Hermione
4597,and Neville.
4598,"“If either of you get us caught, I’ll never rest until I’ve learned"
4599,"that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it on"
4600,you.
4601,"Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how"
4602,"to use the Curse of the Bogies, but Harry hissed at her to be quiet"
4603,and beckoned them all forward.
4604,They flitted along corridors striped with bars of moonlight from
4605,the high windows. At every turn Harry expected to run into Filch
4606,"or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up a staircase to the"
4607,third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room.
4608,Malfoy and Crabbe weren’t there yet. The crystal trophy cases
4609,"glimmered where the moonlight caught them. Cups, shields,"
4610,"plates, and statues winked silver and gold in the darkness. They"
4611,"edged along the walls, keeping their eyes on the doors at either end"
4612,of the room. Harry took out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in and
4613,started at once. The minutes crept by.
4614,"“He’s late, maybe he’s chickened out,” Ron whispered."
4615,Then a noise in the next room made them jump. Harry had only
4616,just raised his wand when they heard someone speak — and it
4617,wasn’t Malfoy.
4618,"“Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking in a corner.”"
4619,"It was Filch speaking to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Harry"
4620, 157   
4621,CHAPTER NINE
4622,waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible;
4623,"they scurried silently toward the door, away from Filch’s voice."
4624,Neville’s robes had barely whipped round the corner when they
4625,heard Filch enter the trophy room.
4626,"“They’re in here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably"
4627,hiding.”
4628,"“This way!” Harry mouthed to the others and, petrified, they"
4629,began to creep down a long gallery full of suits of armor. They
4630,could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out a fright-
4631,"ened squeak and broke into a run — he tripped, grabbed Ron"
4632,"around the waist, and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of"
4633,armor.
4634,The clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole
4635,castle.
4636,"“RUN!” Harry yelled, and the four of them sprinted down the"
4637,"gallery, not looking back to see whether Filch was following —"
4638,they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor
4639,"then another, Harry in the lead, without any idea where they were"
4640,or where they were going — they ripped through a tapestry and
4641,"found themselves in a hidden passageway, hurtled along it and"
4642,"came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles"
4643,from the trophy room.
4644,"“I think we’ve lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against the cold"
4645,"wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing"
4646,and spluttering.
4647,"“I — told — you,” Hermione gasped, clutching at the stitch in"
4648,"her chest, “I — told — you.”"
4649,"“We’ve got to get back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Ron, “quickly"
4650,as possible.”
4651, 158  
4652,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4653,"“Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said to Harry. “You realize"
4654,"that, don’t you? He was never going to meet you — Filch knew"
4655,"someone was going to be in the trophy room, Malfoy must have"
4656,tipped him off.”
4657,"Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn’t going to tell"
4658,her that.
4659,“Let’s go.”
4660,It wasn’t going to be that simple. They hadn’t gone more than a
4661,dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shoot-
4662,ing out of a classroom in front of them.
4663,It was Peeves. He caught sight of them and gave a squeal of de-
4664,light.
4665,"“Shut up, Peeves — please — you’ll get us thrown out.”"
4666,Peeves cackled.
4667,"“Wandering around at midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut."
4668,"Naughty, naughty, you’ll get caughty.”"
4669,"“Not if you don’t give us away, Peeves, please.”"
4670,"“Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves in a sanity voice, but"
4671,"his eyes glittered wickedly. “It’s for your own good, you know.”"
4672,"“Get out of the way,” snapped Ron, taking a swipe at Peeves —"
4673,this was a big mistake.
4674,"“STUDENTS OUT OF BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STU-"
4675,DENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRI-
4676,DOR!”
4677,"Ducking under Peeves, they ran for their lives, right to the end"
4678,of the corridor where they slammed into a door — and it was
4679,locked.
4680,"“This is it!” Ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door,"
4681,“We’re done for! This is the end!”
4682,  159   
4683,CHAPTER NINE
4684,"They could hear footsteps, Filch running as fast as he could"
4685,toward Peeves’s shouts.
4686,"“Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry’s wand,"
4687,"tapped the lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”"
4688,The lock clicked and the door swung open — they piled through
4689,"it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening."
4690,"“Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick,"
4691,tell me.”
4692,“Say ‘please.’ ”
4693,"“Don’t mess with me, Peeves, now where did they go?”"
4694,"“Shan’t say nothing if you don’t say please,” said Peeves in his an-"
4695,noying singsong voice.
4696,“All right — please.”
4697,“NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn’t say nothing if you
4698,didn’t say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard the sound of
4699,Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing in rage.
4700,"“He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we’ll"
4701,"be okay — get off, Neville!” For Neville had been tugging on the"
4702,sleeve of Harry’s bathrobe for the last minute. “What?”
4703,"Harry turned around — and saw, quite clearly, what. For a mo-"
4704,"ment, he was sure he’d walked into a nightmare — this was too"
4705,"much, on top of everything that had happened so far."
4706,"They weren’t in a room, as he had supposed. They were in a cor-"
4707,ridor. The forbidden corridor on the third floor. And now they
4708,knew why it was forbidden.
4709,"They were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog, a"
4710,dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor. It had
4711,"three heads. Three pairs of rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching"
4712,  160   
4713,THE MIDNIGHT DUEL
4714,"and quivering in their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva"
4715,hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs.
4716,"It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring at them, and Harry"
4717,knew that the only reason they weren’t already dead was that their
4718,"sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly get-"
4719,"ting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous"
4720,growls meant.
4721,"Harry groped for the doorknob — between Filch and death,"
4722,he’d take Filch.
4723,"They fell backward — Harry slammed the door shut, and they"
4724,"ran, they almost flew, back down the corridor. Filch must have hur-"
4725,"ried off to look for them somewhere else, because they didn’t see"
4726,"him anywhere, but they hardly cared — all they wanted to do was"
4727,put as much space as possible between them and that monster.
4728,They didn’t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat
4729,Lady on the seventh floor.
4730,"“Where on earth have you all been?” she asked, looking at their"
4731,"bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces."
4732,"“Never mind that — pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and"
4733,the portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common
4734,"room and collapsed, trembling, into armchairs."
4735,"It was a while before any of them said anything. Neville, indeed,"
4736,looked as if he’d never speak again.
4737,"“What do they think they’re doing, keeping a thing like that"
4738,"locked up in a school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise,"
4739,that one does.”
4740,Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back
4741,again.
4742,  161   
4743,CHAPTER NINE
4744,"“You don’t use your eyes, any of you, do you?” she snapped."
4745,“Didn’t you see what it was standing on?”
4746,"“The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn’t looking at its feet, I was"
4747,too busy with its heads.”
4748,"“No, not the floor. It was standing on a trapdoor. It’s obviously"
4749,guarding something.”
4750,"She stood up, glaring at them."
4751,“I hope you’re pleased with yourselves. We could all have been
4752,"killed — or worse, expelled. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to"
4753,bed.”
4754,"Ron stared after her, his mouth open."
4755,"“No, we don’t mind,” he said. “You’d think we dragged her"
4756,"along, wouldn’t you?”"
4757,But Hermione had given Harry something else to think about as
4758,he climbed back into bed. The dog was guarding something. . . .
4759,What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was the safest place in the
4760,world for something you wanted to hide — except perhaps Hog-
4761,warts.
4762,It looked as though Harry had found out where the grubby lit-
4763,tle package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
4764, 162  
4765,CHAPTER TEN
4766,HALLOWEEN
4767,M             alfoy couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw that Harry
4768,"and Ron were still at Hogwarts the next day, looking"
4769,"tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by the next morning Harry"
4770,and Ron thought that meeting the three-headed dog had been an
4771,"excellent adventure, and they were quite keen to have another one."
4772,"In the meantime, Harry filled Ron in about the package that"
4773,"seemed to have been moved from Gringotts to Hogwarts, and they"
4774,spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy
4775,protection.
4776,"“It’s either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron."
4777,"“Or both,” said Harry."
4778,But as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was
4779,"that it was about two inches long, they didn’t have much chance of"
4780,guessing what it was without further clues.
4781,Neither Neville nor Hermione showed the slightest interest in
4782,  163   
4783,CHAPTER TEN
4784,what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor. All Neville cared
4785,about was never going near the dog again.
4786,"Hermione was now refusing to speak to Harry and Ron, but she"
4787,was such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus.
4788,"All they really wanted now was a way of getting back at Malfoy, and"
4789,"to their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a"
4790,week later.
4791,"As the owls flooded into the Great Hall as usual, everyone’s at-"
4792,"tention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six"
4793,large screech owls. Harry was just as interested as everyone else to
4794,"see what was in this large parcel, and was amazed when the owls"
4795,"soared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his ba-"
4796,con to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when an-
4797,other owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel.
4798,"Harry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it"
4799,said:
4800,DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE.
4801,"It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don’t"
4802,want everybody knowing you’ve got a broomstick or they’ll
4803,all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight on the
4804,Quidditch field at seven o’clock for your first training ses-
4805,sion.
4806,Harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to Ron
4807,to read.

4810,“A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I’ve never
4811,even touched one.”
4812,"They left the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the broomstick in"
4813,"private before their first class, but halfway across the entrance hall"
4814,they found the way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy
4815,seized the package from Harry and felt it.
4816,"“That’s a broomstick,” he said, throwing it back to Harry with a"
4817,mixture of jealousy and spite on his face. “You’ll be in for it this
4818,"time, Potter, first years aren’t allowed them.”"
4819,Ron couldn’t resist it.
4820,"“It’s not any old broomstick,” he said, “it’s a Nimbus Two Thou-"
4821,"sand. What did you say you’ve got at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two"
4822,"Sixty?” Ron grinned at Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they’re not"
4823,in the same league as the Nimbus.”
4824,"“What would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn’t afford"
4825,"half the handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your"
4826,brothers have to save up twig by twig.”
4827,"Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared at Mal-"
4828,foy’s elbow.
4829,"“Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked."
4830,"“Potters been sent a broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly."
4831,"“Yes, yes, that’s right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming at Harry."
4832,"“Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances,"
4833,Potter. And what model is it?”
4834,"“A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not to"
4835,laugh at the look of horror on Malfoy’s face. “And it’s really thanks
4836,"to Malfoy here that I’ve got it,” he added."
4837,"Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter at"
4838,Malfoy’s obvious rage and confusion.
4839, 165  
4840,CHAPTER TEN
4841,"“Well, it’s true,” Harry chortled as they reached the top of the"
4842,"marble staircase, “If he hadn’t stolen Neville’s Remembrall I"
4843,wouldn’t be on the team. . . .”
4844,“So I suppose you think that’s a reward for breaking rules?” came
4845,an angry voice from just behind them. Hermione was stomping up
4846,"the stairs, looking disapprovingly at the package in Harry’s hand."
4847,“I thought you weren’t speaking to us?” said Harry.
4848,"“Yes, don’t stop now,” said Ron, “it’s doing us so much good.”"
4849,Hermione marched away with her nose in the air.
4850,Harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that
4851,day. It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broom-
4852,"stick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch"
4853,field where he’d be learning to play that night. He bolted his din-
4854,"ner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then"
4855,rushed upstairs with Ron to unwrap the Nimbus Two Thousand at
4856,last.
4857,"“Wow,” Ron sighed, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry’s bed-"
4858,spread.
4859,"Even Harry, who knew nothing about the different brooms,"
4860,"thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, with a mahogany"
4861,"handle, it had a long tail of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two"
4862,Thousand written in gold near the top.
4863,"As seven o’clock drew nearer, Harry left the castle and set off in"
4864,the dusk toward the Quidditch field. He’d never been inside the
4865,stadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the
4866,field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going
4867,on. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on
4868,the end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle
4869, 166   
4870,HALLOWEEN
4871,"children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet"
4872,high.
4873,"Too eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his"
4874,broomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling — he
4875,swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down
4876,the field. The Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted
4877,at his lightest touch.
4878,"“Hey, Potter, come down!”"
4879,Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate
4880,under his arm. Harry landed next to him.
4881,"“Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGona-"
4882,gall meant . . . you really are a natural. I’m just going to teach you
4883,"the rules this evening, then you’ll be joining team practice three"
4884,times a week.”
4885,He opened the crate. Inside were four different-sized balls.
4886,"“Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough to under-"
4887,"stand, even if it’s not too easy to play. There are seven players on"
4888,each side. Three of them are called Chasers.”
4889,"“Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red"
4890,ball about the size of a soccer ball.
4891,"“This ball’s called the Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw"
4892,the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the
4893,hoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes
4894,through one of the hoops. Follow me?”
4895,“The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to
4896,"score,” Harry recited. “So — that’s sort of like basketball on"
4897,"broomsticks with six hoops, isn’t it?”"
4898,“What’s basketball?” said Wood curiously.
4899,  167  
4900,CHAPTER TEN
4901,"“Never mind,” said Harry quickly."
4902,"“Now, there’s another player on each side who’s called the"
4903,Keeper — I’m Keeper for Gryffindor. I have to fly around our
4904,hoops and stop the other team from scoring.”
4905,"“Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined"
4906,"to remember it all. “And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that."
4907,So what are they for?” He pointed at the three balls left inside the
4908,box.
4909,"“I’ll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”"
4910,"He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat."
4911,"“I’m going to show you what the Bludgers do,” Wood said."
4912,“These two are the Bludgers.”
4913,"He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly"
4914,smaller than the red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be
4915,straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box.
4916,"“Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed"
4917,one of the Bludgers.
4918,"At once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted"
4919,straight at Harry’s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it
4920,"from breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air —"
4921,"it zoomed around their heads and then shot at Wood, who dived"
4922,on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground.
4923,"“See?” Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into"
4924,"the crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around,"
4925,trying to knock players off their brooms. That’s why you have two
4926,Beaters on each team — the Weasley twins are ours — it’s their job
4927,to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them
4928,toward the other team. So — think you’ve got all that?”
4929, 168  
4930,HALLOWEEN
4931,“Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the Keeper
4932,guards the goal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their
4933,"team,” Harry reeled off."
4934,"“Very good,” said Wood."
4935,"“Er — have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hop-"
4936,ing he sounded offhand.
4937,“Never at Hogwarts. We’ve had a couple of broken jaws but
4938,"nothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the"
4939,Seeker. That’s you. And you don’t have to worry about the Quaffle
4940,or the Bludgers —”
4941,“— unless they crack my head open.”
4942,"“Don’t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the"
4943,"Bludgers — I mean, they’re like a pair of human Bludgers them-"
4944,selves.”
4945,Wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last
4946,"ball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny,"
4947,about the size of a large walnut. It was bright gold and had little
4948,fluttering silver wings.
4949,"“This,” said Wood, “is the Golden Snitch, and it’s the most im-"
4950,portant ball of the lot. It’s very hard to catch because it’s so fast and
4951,difficult to see. It’s the Seeker’s job to catch it. You’ve got to weave
4952,"in and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it"
4953,"before the other team’s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches"
4954,"the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they"
4955,nearly always win. That’s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game
4956,"of Quidditch only ends when the Snitch is caught, so it can go on"
4957,"for ages — I think the record is three months, they had to keep"
4958,bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep.
4959, 169   
4960,CHAPTER TEN
4961,"“Well, that’s it — any questions?”"
4962,Harry shook his head. He understood what he had to do all
4963,"right, it was doing it that was going to be the problem."
4964,"“We won’t practice with the Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully"
4965,"shutting it back inside the crate, “it’s too dark, we might lose it."
4966,Let’s try you out with a few of these.”
4967,He pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few
4968,"minutes later, he and Harry were up in the air, Wood throwing the"
4969,golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for Harry to catch.
4970,"Harry didn’t miss a single one, and Wood was delighted. After"
4971,"half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn’t carry on."
4972,"“That Quidditch Cup’ll have our name on it this year,” said"
4973,Wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle. “I wouldn’t be
4974,"surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could"
4975,have played for England if he hadn’t gone off chasing dragons.”
4976,"Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what with Quidditch"
4977,"practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework, but"
4978,Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he’d already
4979,been at Hogwarts two months. The castle felt more like home than
4980,"Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and"
4981,more interesting now that they had mastered the basics.
4982,On Halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of bak-
4983,"ing pumpkin wafting through the corridors. Even better, Professor"
4984,Flitwick announced in Charms that he thought they were ready to
4985,"start making objects fly, something they had all been dying to try"
4986,since they’d seen him make Neville’s toad zoom around the class-
4987,room. Professor Flitwick put the class into pairs to practice. Harry’s
4988, 170   
4989,HALLOWEEN
4990,"partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was a relief, because Neville"
4991,"had been trying to catch his eye). Ron, however, was to be working"
4992,with Hermione Granger. It was hard to tell whether Ron or
4993,Hermione was angrier about this. She hadn’t spoken to either of
4994,them since the day Harry’s broomstick had arrived.
4995,"“Now, don’t forget that nice wrist movement we’ve been practic-"
4996,"ing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched on top of his pile of"
4997,"books as usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And"
4998,"saying the magic words properly is very important, too — never"
4999,"forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s’ instead of ‘f ’ and found himself"
5000,on the floor with a buffalo on his chest.”
5001,"It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but"
5002,the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on
5003,the desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his
5004,wand and set fire to it — Harry had to put it out with his hat.
5005,"Ron, at the next table, wasn’t having much more luck."
5006,"“Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like a"
5007,windmill.
5008,"“You’re saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s"
5009,"Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make the ‘gar’ nice and long.”"
5010,"“You do it, then, if you’re so clever,” Ron snarled."
5011,"Hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown, flicked her wand,"
5012,"and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”"
5013,Their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above
5014,their heads.
5015,"“Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone"
5016,"see here, Miss Granger’s done it!”"
5017,Ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class.
5018, 171   
5019,CHAPTER TEN
5020,"“It’s no wonder no one can stand her,” he said to Harry as they"
5021,"pushed their way into the crowded corridor, “she’s a nightmare,"
5022,honestly.”
5023,Someone knocked into Harry as they hurried past him. It was
5024,Hermione. Harry caught a glimpse of her face — and was startled
5025,to see that she was in tears.
5026,“I think she heard you.”
5027,"“So?” said Ron, but he looked a bit uncomfortable. “She must’ve"
5028,noticed she’s got no friends.”
5029,Hermione didn’t turn up for the next class and wasn’t seen all af-
5030,ternoon. On their way down to the Great Hall for the Halloween
5031,"feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend"
5032,Lavender that Hermione was crying in the girls’ bathroom and
5033,"wanted to be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward at this, but"
5034,"a moment later they had entered the Great Hall, where the Hal-"
5035,loween decorations put Hermione out of their minds.
5036,A thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a
5037,"thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds, mak-"
5038,ing the candles in the pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared sud-
5039,"denly on the golden plates, as it had at the start-of-term banquet."
5040,Harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when Professor
5041,"Quirrell came sprinting into the hall, his turban askew and terror"
5042,on his face. Everyone stared as he reached Professor Dumbledore’s
5043,"chair, slumped against the table, and gasped, “Troll — in the dun-"
5044,geons — thought you ought to know.”
5045,He then sank to the floor in a dead faint.
5046,There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers explod-
5047,ing from the end of Professor Dumbledore’s wand to bring silence.
5048, 172 

5050,"“Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back to the dormito-"
5051,ries immediately!”
5052,Percy was in his element.
5053,"“Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need to fear the troll"
5054,"if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first"
5055,"years coming through! Excuse me, I’m a prefect!”"
5056,“How could a troll get in?” Harry asked as they climbed the
5057,stairs.
5058,"“Don’t ask me, they’re supposed to be really stupid,” said Ron."
5059,“Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke.”
5060,They passed different groups of people hurrying in different di-
5061,rections. As they jostled their way through a crowd of confused
5062,"Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron’s arm."
5063,“I’ve just thought — Hermione.”
5064,“What about her?”
5065,“She doesn’t know about the troll.”
5066,Ron bit his lip.
5067,"“Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy’d better not see us.”"
5068,"Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepuffs going the other way,"
5069,"slipped down a deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward the"
5070,girls’ bathroom. They had just turned the corner when they heard
5071,quick footsteps behind them.
5072,"“Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a large stone griffin."
5073,"Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He"
5074,crossed the corridor and disappeared from view.
5075,“What’s he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn’t he down in the
5076,dungeons with the rest of the teachers?”
5077,“Search me.”
5078, 173   
5079,CHAPTER TEN
5080,"Quietly as possible, they crept along the next corridor after"
5081,Snape’s fading footsteps.
5082,"“He’s heading for the third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up"
5083,his hand.
5084,“Can you smell something?”
5085,"Harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils, a mixture of"
5086,old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean.
5087,"And then they heard it — a low grunting, and the shuffling"
5088,footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed — at the end of a passage to
5089,"the left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank"
5090,into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moon-
5091,light.
5092,"It was a horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was a dull, gran-"
5093,"ite gray, its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head"
5094,perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks
5095,"with flat, horny feet. The smell coming from it was incredible. It"
5096,"was holding a huge wooden club, which dragged along the floor"
5097,because its arms were so long.
5098,The troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside. It wag-
5099,"gled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly"
5100,into the room.
5101,"“The key’s in the lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”"
5102,"“Good idea,” said Ron nervously."
5103,"They edged toward the open door, mouths dry, praying the troll"
5104,"wasn’t about to come out of it. With one great leap, Harry man-"
5105,"aged to grab the key, slam the door, and lock it."
5106,“Yes!”
5107,"Flushed with their victory, they started to run back up the pas-"

5109,HALLOWEEN
5110,"sage, but as they reached the corner they heard something that"
5111,"made their hearts stop — a high, petrified scream — and it was"
5112,coming from the chamber they’d just chained up.
5113,"“Oh, no,” said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron."
5114,“It’s the girls’ bathroom!” Harry gasped.
5115,“Hermione!” they said together.
5116,"It was the last thing they wanted to do, but what choice did they"
5117,"have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back to the door and turned"
5118,"the key, fumbling in their panic. Harry pulled the door open and"
5119,they ran inside.
5120,"Hermione Granger was shrinking against the wall opposite,"
5121,"looking as if she was about to faint. The troll was advancing on her,"
5122,knocking the sinks off the walls as it went.
5123,"“Confuse it!” Harry said desperately to Ron, and, seizing a tap,"
5124,he threw it as hard as he could against the wall.
5125,The troll stopped a few feet from Hermione. It lumbered
5126,"around, blinking stupidly, to see what had made the noise. Its"
5127,"mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made for him instead,"
5128,lifting its club as it went.
5129,"“Oy, pea-brain!” yelled Ron from the other side of the chamber,"
5130,and he threw a metal pipe at it. The troll didn’t even seem to notice
5131,"the pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again,"
5132,"turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to"
5133,run around it.
5134,"“Come on, run, run !” Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull"
5135,"her toward the door, but she couldn’t move, she was still flat against"
5136,"the wall, her mouth open with terror."
5137,The shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll
5138, 175  
5139,CHAPTER TEN
5140,"berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest"
5141,and had no way to escape.
5142,Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stu-
5143,pid: He took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms
5144,around the troll’s neck from behind. The troll couldn’t feel Harry
5145,"hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of"
5146,"wood up its nose, and Harry’s wand had still been in his hand when"
5147,he’d jumped — it had gone straight up one of the troll’s nostrils.
5148,"Howling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with"
5149,"Harry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to"
5150,rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club.
5151,Hermione had sunk to the floor in fright; Ron pulled out his
5152,own wand — not knowing what he was going to do he heard him-
5153,self cry the first spell that came into his head: “Wingardium
5154,Leviosa!”
5155,"The club flew suddenly out of the troll’s hand, rose high, high"
5156,"up into the air, turned slowly over — and dropped, with a sicken-"
5157,"ing crack, onto its owner’s head. The troll swayed on the spot and"
5158,"then fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room"
5159,tremble.
5160,Harry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was
5161,"standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had"
5162,done.
5163,It was Hermione who spoke first.
5164,“Is it — dead?”
5165,"“I don’t think so,” said Harry, “I think it’s just been knocked out.”"
5166,He bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll’s nose. It was
5167,covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.
5168, 176    
5169,HALLOWEEN
5170,“Urgh — troll boogers.”
5171,He wiped it on the troll’s trousers.
5172,A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them
5173,"look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making,"
5174,"but of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and"
5175,"the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come"
5176,"bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell"
5177,"bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a"
5178,"faint whimper, and sat quickly down on a toilet, clutching his"
5179,heart.
5180,Snape bent over the troll. Professor McGonagall was looking at
5181,Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips
5182,were white. Hopes of winning fifty points for Gryffindor faded
5183,quickly from Harry’s mind.
5184,“What on earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGona-
5185,"gall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still"
5186,standing with his wand in the air. “You’re lucky you weren’t killed.
5187,Why aren’t you in your dormitory?”
5188,"Snape gave Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry looked at the"
5189,floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.
5190,Then a small voice came out of the shadows.
5191,"“Please, Professor McGonagall — they were looking for me.”"
5192,“Miss Granger!”
5193,Hermione had managed to get to her feet at last.
5194,“I went looking for the troll because I — I thought I could deal
5195,"with it on my own — you know, because I’ve read all about them.”"
5196,"Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling a downright"
5197,lie to a teacher?

5200,"“If they hadn’t found me, I’d be dead now. Harry stuck his wand"
5201,up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club. They didn’t
5202,have time to come and fetch anyone. It was about to finish me off
5203,when they arrived.”
5204,Harry and Ron tried to look as though this story wasn’t new to
5205,them.
5206,"“Well — in that case . . .” said Professor McGonagall, staring at"
5207,"the three of them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you"
5208,think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?”
5209,Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was
5210,"the last person to do anything against the rules, and here she was,"
5211,"pretending she had, to get them out of trouble. It was as if Snape"
5212,had started handing out sweets.
5213,"“Miss Granger, five points will be taken from Gryffindor for"
5214,"this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I’m very disappointed in you. If"
5215,"you’re not hurt at all, you’d better get off to Gryffindor Tower. Stu-"
5216,dents are finishing the feast in their Houses.”
5217,Hermione left.
5218,Professor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
5219,"“Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could"
5220,have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win
5221,Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of
5222,this. You may go.”
5223,They hurried out of the chamber and didn’t speak at all until
5224,they had climbed two floors up. It was a relief to be away from the
5225,"smell of the troll, quite apart from anything else."
5226,"“We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled."
5227,"“Five, you mean, once she’s taken off Hermione’s.”"
5228, 178  
5229,HALLOWEEN
5230,"“Good of her to get us out of trouble like that,” Ron admitted."
5231,"“Mind you, we did save her.”"
5232,“She might not have needed saving if we hadn’t locked the thing
5233,"in with her,” Harry reminded him."
5234,They had reached the portrait of the Fat Lady.
5235,"“Pig snout,” they said and entered."
5236,The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating
5237,"the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by"
5238,"the door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause."
5239,"Then, none of them looking at each other, they all said “Thanks,”"
5240,and hurried off to get plates.
5241,"But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their"
5242,friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up
5243,"liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is"
5244,one of them.

5248,"A        s they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The"
5249,mountains around the school became icy gray and the
5250,lake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered
5251,in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrost-
5252,"ing broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long"
5253,"moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin"
5254,boots.
5255,"The Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be"
5256,playing in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus
5257,"Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up into second"
5258,place in the House Championship.
5259,Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided
5260,"that, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But"
5261,"the news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and"
5262,Harry didn’t know which was worse — people telling him he’d be
5263, 180  
5264,QUIDDITCH
5265,brilliant or people telling him they’d be running around under-
5266,neath him holding a mattress.
5267,It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione as a friend. He
5268,didn’t know how he’d have gotten through all his homework with-
5269,"out her, what with all the last-minute Quidditch practice Wood"
5270,was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the
5271,"Ages, which turned out to be a very interesting read."
5272,Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of commit-
5273,ting a Quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a
5274,World Cup match in 1473; that Seekers were usually the smallest
5275,"and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents"
5276,seemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died play-
5277,"ing Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up"
5278,months later in the Sahara Desert.
5279,Hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules
5280,"since Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and"
5281,she was much nicer for it. The day before Harry’s first Quidditch
5282,match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during
5283,"break, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could"
5284,be carried around in a jam jar. They were standing with their backs
5285,"to it, getting warm, when Snape crossed the yard. Harry noticed at"
5286,"once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved"
5287,closer together to block the fire from view; they were sure it
5288,"wouldn’t be allowed. Unfortunately, something about their guilty"
5289,"faces caught Snape’s eye. He limped over. He hadn’t seen the fire,"
5290,but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway.
5291,"“What’s that you’ve got there, Potter?”"
5292,It was Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry showed him.
5293,  181 
5294,CHAPTER ELEVEN
5295,"“Library books are not to be taken outside the school,” said"
5296,Snape. “Give it to me. Five points from Gryffindor.”
5297,"“He’s just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily as Snape"
5298,limped away. “Wonder what’s wrong with his leg?”
5299,"“Dunno, but I hope it’s really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly."
5300,"The Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry,"
5301,"Ron, and Hermione sat together next to a window. Hermione was"
5302,checking Harry and Ron’s Charms homework for them. She would
5303,"never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her to"
5304,"read it through, they got the right answers anyway."
5305,"Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through the Ages back,"
5306,to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow. Why should he be
5307,"afraid of Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was go-"
5308,ing to ask Snape if he could have it.
5309,"“Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea"
5310,that Snape wouldn’t refuse if there were other teachers listening.
5311,He made his way down to the staffroom and knocked. There
5312,was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.
5313,Perhaps Snape had left the book in there? It was worth a try. He
5314,pushed the door ajar and peered inside — and a horrible scene met
5315,his eyes.
5316,"Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes"
5317,above his knees. One of his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was
5318,handing Snape bandages.
5319,"“Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed to"
5320,keep your eyes on all three heads at once?”
5321,"Harry tried to shut the door quietly, but —"
5322,  182  
5323,QUIDDITCH
5324,“POTTER!”
5325,Snape’s face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes
5326,quickly to hide his leg. Harry gulped.
5327,“I just wondered if I could have my book back.”
5328,“GET OUT! OUT !”
5329,"Harry left, before Snape could take any more points from"
5330,Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.
5331,“Did you get it?” Ron asked as Harry joined them. “What’s the
5332,matter?”
5333,"In a low whisper, Harry told them what he’d seen."
5334,“You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried
5335,to get past that three-headed dog at Halloween! That’s where he
5336,was going when we saw him — he’s after whatever it’s guarding!
5337,"And I’d bet my broomstick he let that troll in, to make a diversion!”"
5338,Hermione’s eyes were wide.
5339,"“No — he wouldn’t,” she said. “I know he’s not very nice, but he"
5340,wouldn’t try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”
5341,"“Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or some-"
5342,"thing,” snapped Ron. “I’m with Harry. I wouldn’t put anything"
5343,past Snape. But what’s he after? What’s that dog guarding?”
5344,Harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same ques-
5345,"tion. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn’t sleep. He tried"
5346,"to empty his mind — he needed to sleep, he had to, he had his first"
5347,Quidditch match in a few hours — but the expression on Snape’s
5348,face when Harry had seen his leg wasn’t easy to forget.
5349,The next morning dawned very bright and cold. The Great Hall
5350,was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer-
5351, 183  
5352,CHAPTER ELEVEN
5353,ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good Quidditch
5354,match.
5355,“You’ve got to eat some breakfast.”
5356,“I don’t want anything.”
5357,"“Just a bit of toast,” wheedled Hermione."
5358,“I’m not hungry.”
5359,Harry felt terrible. In an hour’s time he’d be walking onto the
5360,field.
5361,"“Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seek-"
5362,ers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.”
5363,"“Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup"
5364,on his sausages.
5365,By eleven o’clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands
5366,around the Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. The
5367,"seats might be raised high in the air, but it was still difficult to see"
5368,what was going on sometimes.
5369,"Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean the West"
5370,"Ham fan up in the top row. As a surprise for Harry, they had"
5371,painted a large banner on one of the sheets Scabbers had ruined. It
5372,"said Potter for President, and Dean, who was good at drawing, had"
5373,done a large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had
5374,performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different
5375,colors.
5376,"Meanwhile, in the locker room, Harry and the rest of the team"
5377,were changing into their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would
5378,be playing in green).
5379,Wood cleared his throat for silence.
5380, 184  
5381,QUIDDITCH
5382,"“Okay, men,” he said."
5383,"“And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson."
5384,"“And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”"
5385,"“The big one,” said Fred Weasley."
5386,"“The one we’ve all been waiting for,” said George."
5387,"“We know Oliver’s speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were"
5388,on the team last year.”
5389,"“Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is the best team Gryf-"
5390,findor’s had in years. We’re going to win. I know it.”
5391,"He glared at them all as if to say, “Or else.”"
5392,"“Right. It’s time. Good luck, all of you.”"
5393,"Harry followed Fred and George out of the locker room and,"
5394,"hoping his knees weren’t going to give way, walked onto the field to"
5395,loud cheers.
5396,Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the middle of the
5397,"field waiting for the two teams, her broom in her hand."
5398,"“Now, I want a nice fair game, all of you,” she said, once they"
5399,were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed to be
5400,"speaking particularly to the Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, a fifth"
5401,year. Harry thought Flint looked as if he had some troll blood in
5402,him. Out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high
5403,"above, flashing Potter for President over the crowd. His heart"
5404,skipped. He felt braver.
5405,"“Mount your brooms, please.”"
5406,Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
5407,Madam Hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
5408,"Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high into the air. They were off."
5409,“And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of

5414,“JORDAN!”

5416,"The Weasley twins’ friend, Lee Jordan, was doing the commen-"

5418,"“And she’s really belting along up there, a neat pass to Alicia"
5419,"Spinnet, a good find of Oliver Wood’s, last year only a reserve —"
5420,"back to Johnson and — no, the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle,"
5421,Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he
5422,"goes — Flint flying like an eagle up there — he’s going to sc- no,"
5423,stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and
5424,the Gryffindors take the Quaffle — that’s Chaser Katie Bell of
5425,"Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up the field and —"
5426,"OUCH — that must have hurt, hit in the back of the head by a"
5427,Bludger — Quaffle taken by the Slytherins — that’s Adrian Pucey
5428,"speeding off toward the goal posts, but he’s blocked by a second"
5429,"Bludger — sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can’t tell"
5430,"which — nice play by the Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson"
5431,"back in possession of the Quaffle, a clear field ahead and off she"
5432,goes — she’s really flying — dodges a speeding Bludger — the
5433,"goal posts are ahead — come on, now, Angelina — Keeper Bletch-"
5434,ley dives — misses — GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”
5435,"Gryffindor cheers filled the cold air, with howls and moans from"
5436,the Slytherins.
5437,"“Budge up there, move along.”"
5438,“Hagrid!”
5439,Ron and Hermione squeezed together to give Hagrid enough
5440,space to join them.
5441, 186  
5442,QUIDDITCH
5443,"“Bin watchin’ from me hut,” said Hagrid, patting a large pair of"
5444,"binoculars around his neck, “But it isn’t the same as bein’ in the"
5445,"crowd. No sign of the Snitch yet, eh?”"
5446,"“Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn’t had much to do yet.”"
5447,"“Kept outta trouble, though, that’s somethin’,” said Hagrid, rais-"
5448,ing his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was Harry.
5449,"Way up above them, Harry was gliding over the game, squinting"
5450,about for some sign of the Snitch. This was part of his and Wood’s
5451,game plan.
5452,"“Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch,” Wood"
5453,had said. “We don’t want you attacked before you have to be.”
5454,"When Angelina had scored, Harry had done a couple of loop-"
5455,the-loops to let off his feelings. Now he was back to staring around
5456,"for the Snitch. Once he caught sight of a flash of gold, but it was"
5457,"just a reflection from one of the Weasleys’ wristwatches, and once a"
5458,"Bludger decided to come pelting his way, more like a cannonball"
5459,"than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chas-"
5460,ing after it.
5461,"“All right there, Harry?” he had time to yell, as he beat the"
5462,Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.
5463,"“Slytherin in possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey"
5464,"ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds"
5465,toward the — wait a moment — was that the Snitch?”
5466,A murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the
5467,"Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that"
5468,had passed his left ear.
5469,Harry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward
5470,"after the streak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it,"
5471,too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward the Snitch — all the
5472,  187 
5473,CHAPTER ELEVEN
5474,Chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be
5475,doing as they hung in midair to watch.
5476,"Harry was faster than Higgs — he could see the little round ball,"
5477,"wings fluttering, darting up ahead — he put on an extra spurt of"
5478,speed —
5479,WHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below —
5480,"Marcus Flint had blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry’s broom"
5481,"spun off course, Harry holding on for dear life."
5482,“Foul!” screamed the Gryffindors.
5483,Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Flint and then ordered a free
5484,"shot at the goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of"
5485,"course, the Golden Snitch had disappeared from sight again."
5486,"Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off,"
5487,ref! Red card!”
5488,"“What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron."
5489,“Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown the
5490,red card and you’re out of the game!”
5491,"“But this isn’t soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him."
5492,"Hagrid, however, was on Dean’s side."
5493,“They oughta change the rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry
5494,outta the air.”
5495,Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides.
5496,“So — after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating —”
5497,“Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.
5498,"“I mean, after that open and revolting foul —”"
5499,"“Jordan, I’m warning you —”"
5500,"“All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which"
5501,"could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor,"
5502,  188   
5503,QUIDDITCH
5504,"taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue"
5505,"play, Gryffindor still in possession.”"
5506,"It was as Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning"
5507,"dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave a sud-"
5508,"den, frightening lurch. For a split second, he thought he was going"
5509,to fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and
5510,knees. He’d never felt anything like that.
5511,It happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to
5512,buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly de-
5513,cide to buck their riders off. Harry tried to turn back toward the
5514,Gryffindor goal posts — he had half a mind to ask Wood to call
5515,time-out — and then he realized that his broom was completely
5516,out of his control. He couldn’t turn it. He couldn’t direct it at all. It
5517,"was zigzagging through the air, and every now and then making vi-"
5518,olent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
5519,Lee was still commentating.
5520,“Slytherin in possession — Flint with the Quaffle — passes
5521,"Spinnet — passes Bell — hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it"
5522,"broke his nose — only joking, Professor — Slytherins score — oh"
5523,no . . .”
5524,The Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed
5525,that Harry’s broom was behaving strangely It was carrying him
5526,"slowly higher, away from the game, jerking and twitching as it"
5527,went.
5528,"“Dunno what Harry thinks he’s doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He"
5529,"stared through his binoculars. “If I didn’ know better, I’d say he’d"
5530,lost control of his broom . . . but he can’t have. . . .”
5531,"Suddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands."
5532, 189  
5533,CHAPTER ELEVEN
5534,"His broom had started to roll over and over, with him only just"
5535,managing to hold on. Then the whole crowd gasped. Harry’s
5536,broom had given a wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now
5537,"dangling from it, holding on with only one hand."
5538,“Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus
5539,whispered.
5540,"“Can’t have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can’t nothing in-"
5541,terfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic — no kid
5542,could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand.”
5543,"At these words, Hermione seized Hagrid’s binoculars, but in-"
5544,"stead of looking up at Harry, she started looking frantically at the"
5545,crowd.
5546,"“What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray-faced."
5547,"“I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape — look.”"
5548,Ron grabbed the binoculars. Snape was in the middle of the
5549,stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed on Harry and was mut-
5550,tering nonstop under his breath.
5551,"“He’s doing something — jinxing the broom,” said Hermione."
5552,“What should we do?”
5553,“Leave it to me.”
5554,"Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared."
5555,Ron turned the binoculars back on Harry. His broom was vibrat-
5556,"ing so hard, it was almost impossible for him to hang on much"
5557,"longer. The whole crowd was on its feet, watching, terrified, as"
5558,the Weasleys flew up to try and pull Harry safely onto one of
5559,"their brooms, but it was no good — every time they got near him,"
5560,the broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and cir-
5561,"cled beneath him, obviously hoping to catch him if he fell. Marcus"
5562, 190   
5563,QUIDDITCH
5564,Flint seized the Quaffle and scored five times without anyone
5565,noticing.
5566,"“Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately."
5567,Hermione had fought her way across to the stand where Snape
5568,"stood, and was now racing along the row behind him; she didn’t"
5569,even stop to say sorry as she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst
5570,"into the row in front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled"
5571,"out her wand, and whispered a few, well-chosen words. Bright blue"
5572,flames shot from her wand onto the hem of Snape’s robes.
5573,It took perhaps thirty seconds for Snape to realize that he was on
5574,fire. A sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping the fire
5575,"off him into a little jar in her pocket, she scrambled back along the"
5576,row — Snape would never know what had happened.
5577,"It was enough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly able to clam-"
5578,ber back on to his broom.
5579,"“Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing into"
5580,Hagrid’s jacket for the last five minutes.
5581,Harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him
5582,clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick — he
5583,hit the field on all fours — coughed — and something gold fell
5584,into his hand.
5585,"“I’ve got the Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and"
5586,the game ended in complete confusion.
5587,"“He didn’t catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howl-"
5588,"ing twenty minutes later, but it made no difference — Harry"

5594,"made a cup of strong tea back in Hagrid’s hut, with Ron and"
5595,Hermione.
5596,"“It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him."
5597,"He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn’t take his"
5598,eyes off you.”
5599,"“Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn’t heard a word of what had"
5600,gone on next to him in the stands. “Why would Snape do some-
5601,thin’ like that?”
5602,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another, wondering"
5603,what to tell him. Harry decided on the truth.
5604,"“I found out something about him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried"
5605,to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween. It bit him. We
5606,think he was trying to steal whatever it’s guarding.”
5607,Hagrid dropped the teapot.
5608,“How do you know about Fluffy?” he said.
5609,“Fluffy?”
5610,“Yeah — he’s mine — bought him off a Greek chappie I met in
5611,the pub las’ year — I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the —”
5612,“Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
5613,"“Now, don’t ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That’s top"
5614,"secret, that is.”"
5615,“But Snape’s trying to steal it.”
5616,"“Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape’s a Hogwarts teacher, he’d"
5617,do nothin’ of the sort.”
5618,“So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
5619,The afternoon’s events certainly seemed to have changed her
5620,mind about Snape.
5621,"“I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them!"

5624,"You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I"
5625,saw him!”
5626,"“I’m tellin’ yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don’ know why"
5627,"Harry’s broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn’ try an’ kill a stu-"
5628,"dent! Now, listen to me, all three of yeh — yer meddlin’ in things"
5629,"that don’ concern yeh. It’s dangerous. You forget that dog, an’ you"
5630,"forget what it’s guardin’, that’s between Professor Dumbledore an’"

5632,"“Aha!” said Harry, “so there’s someone called Nicolas Flamel in-"

5634,Hagrid looked furious with himself.

5638,"C      hristmas was coming. One morning in mid-December,"
5639,Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow.
5640,The lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for be-
5641,"witching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around,"
5642,bouncing off the back of his turban. The few owls that managed to
5643,battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be
5644,nursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.
5645,No one could wait for the holidays to start. While the Gryf-
5646,"findor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the"
5647,drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the
5648,windows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape’s
5649,"classes down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist"
5650,before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot caul-
5651,drons.
5652,"“I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all"
5653, 194 
5654,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
5655,those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because
5656,they’re not wanted at home.”
5657,He was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle
5658,"chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-"
5659,"fish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than"
5660,usual since the Quidditch match. Disgusted that the Slytherins had
5661,"lost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed"
5662,tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he’d real-
5663,"ized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so im-"
5664,pressed at the way Harry had managed to stay on his bucking
5665,"broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back to taunt-"
5666,ing Harry about having no proper family.
5667,It was true that Harry wasn’t going back to Privet Drive for
5668,Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week be-
5669,"fore, making a list of students who would be staying for the holi-"
5670,"days, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn’t feel sorry for"
5671,himself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he’d ever
5672,"had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs."
5673,Weasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie.
5674,"When they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found"
5675,a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet
5676,sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that
5677,Hagrid was behind it.
5678,"“Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head"
5679,through the branches.
5680,"“Nah, I’m all right, thanks, Ron.”"
5681,“Would you mind moving out of the way?” came Malfoy’s cold
5682,drawl from behind them. “Are you trying to earn some extra
5683, 195   
5684,CHAPTER TWELVE
5685,"money, Weasley? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you"
5686,"leave Hogwarts, I suppose — that hut of Hagrid’s must seem like a"
5687,palace compared to what your family’s used to.”
5688,Ron dived at Malfoy just as Snape came up the stairs.
5689,“WEASLEY!”
5690,Ron let go of the front of Malfoy’s robes.
5691,"“He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his"
5692,huge hairy face out from behind the tree. “Malfoy was insultin’ his
5693,family.”
5694,"“Be that as it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,”"
5695,"said Snape silkily. “Five points from Gryffindor, Weasley, and be"
5696,"grateful it isn’t more. Move along, all of you.”"
5697,"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past the tree, scat-"
5698,tering needles everywhere and smirking.
5699,"“I’ll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth at Malfoy’s back, “one"
5700,"of these days, I’ll get him —”"
5701,"“I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”"
5702,"“Come on, cheer up, it’s nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell"
5703,"yeh what, come with me an’ see the Great Hall, looks a treat.”"
5704,So the three of them followed Hagrid and his tree off to the
5705,"Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick"
5706,were busy with the Christmas decorations.
5707,"“Ah, Hagrid, the last tree — put it in the far corner, would you?”"
5708,The hall looked spectacular. Festoons of holly and mistletoe
5709,"hung all around the walls, and no less than twelve towering Christ-"
5710,"mas trees stood around the room, some sparkling with tiny icicles,"
5711,some glittering with hundreds of candles.
5712,“How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.
5713, 196  
5714,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
5715,"“Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me — Harry,"
5716,"Ron, we’ve got half an hour before lunch, we should be in the li-"
5717,brary.”
5718,"“Oh yeah, you’re right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away from"
5719,"Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his"
5720,wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree.
5721,"“The library?” said Hagrid, following them out of the hall. “Just"
5722,"before the holidays? Bit keen, aren’t yeh?”"
5723,"“Oh, we’re not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since"
5724,you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we’ve been trying to find out who
5725,he is.”
5726,“You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here — I’ve told
5727,yeh — drop it. It’s nothin’ to you what that dog’s guardin’.”
5728,"“We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is, that’s all,” said"
5729,Hermione.
5730,“Unless you’d like to tell us and save us the trouble?” Harry
5731,added. “We must’ve been through hundreds of books already and
5732,we can’t find him anywhere — just give us a hint — I know I’ve
5733,read his name somewhere.”
5734,"“I’m sayin’ nothin’,” said Hagrid flatly."
5735,"“Just have to find out for ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they"
5736,left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library.
5737,They had indeed been searching books for Flamel’s name ever
5738,"since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going to"
5739,"find out what Snape was trying to steal? The trouble was, it was very"
5740,"hard to know where to begin, not knowing what Flamel might"
5741,have done to get himself into a book. He wasn’t in Great Wizards of
5742,"the Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names of Our Time; he"
5743, 197   
5744,CHAPTER TWELVE
5745,"was missing, too, from Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and"
5746,"A Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry. And then, of course,"
5747,there was the sheer size of the library; tens of thousands of books;
5748,thousands of shelves; hundreds of narrow rows.
5749,Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided
5750,to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started
5751,pulling them off the shelves at random. Harry wandered over to
5752,the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if
5753,"Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a"
5754,specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the
5755,"restricted books, and he knew he’d never get one. These were the"
5756,"books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts,"
5757,and only read by older students studying advanced Defense
5758,Against the Dark Arts.
5759,"“What are you looking for, boy?”"
5760,"“Nothing,” said Harry."
5761,Madam Pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him.
5762,"“You’d better get out, then. Go on — out!”"
5763,"Wishing he’d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story,"
5764,"Harry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed"
5765,they’d better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel.
5766,"They were sure she’d be able to tell them, but they couldn’t risk"
5767,Snape hearing what they were up to.
5768,Harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had
5769,"found anything, but he wasn’t very hopeful. They had been look-"
5770,"ing for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments be-"
5771,tween lessons it wasn’t surprising they’d found nothing. What they
5772,really needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breath-
5773,ing down their necks.
5774, 198   
5775,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
5776,"Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their"
5777,heads. They went off to lunch.
5778,"“You will keep looking while I’m away, won’t you?” said"
5779,Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”
5780,"“And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,”"
5781,said Ron. “It’d be safe to ask them.”
5782,"“Very safe, as they’re both dentists,” said Hermione."
5783,"Once the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too"
5784,good a time to think much about Flamel. They had the dormitory
5785,"to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual,"
5786,so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by
5787,the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork —
5788,"bread, English muffins, marshmallows — and plotting ways of get-"
5789,"ting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they"
5790,wouldn’t work.
5791,Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly
5792,"like Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made"
5793,it a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron’s set was very old and
5794,"battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged"
5795,"to someone else in his family — in this case, his grandfather."
5796,"However, old chessmen weren’t a drawback at all. Ron knew"
5797,them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he
5798,wanted.
5799,"Harry played with chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him,"
5800,and they didn’t trust him at all. He wasn’t a very good player yet
5801,"and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him, which was"
5802,"confusing. “Don’t send me there, can’t you see his knight? Send"
5803,"him, we can afford to lose him.”"
5804, 199   
5805,CHAPTER TWELVE
5806,"On Christmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking forward to the"
5807,"next day for the food and the fun, but not expecting any presents"
5808,"at all. When he woke early in the morning, however, the first thing"
5809,he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed.
5810,"“Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily as Harry scrambled out of"
5811,bed and pulled on his bathrobe.
5812,"“You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look at this? I’ve got some pre-"
5813,sents!”
5814,"“What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning to his own"
5815,"pile, which was a lot bigger than Harry’s."
5816,Harry picked up the top parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown
5817,"paper and scrawled across it was To Harry, from Hagrid. Inside was"
5818,a roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it him-
5819,self. Harry blew it — it sounded a bit like an owl.
5820,"A second, very small parcel contained a note."
5821,We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. From
5822,Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a fifty-pence
5823,piece.
5824,"“That’s friendly,” said Harry."
5825,Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence.
5826,"“Weird !” he said, “What a shape! This is money?”"
5827,"“You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing at how pleased Ron was."
5828,“Hagrid and my aunt and uncle — so who sent these?”
5829,"“I think I know who that one’s from,” said Ron, turning a bit"
5830,pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her
5831,"you didn’t expect any presents and — oh, no,” he groaned, “she’s"
5832,made you a Weasley sweater.”
5833,"Harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick, hand-knitted"
5834,sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge.
5835, 200  
5836,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
5837,"“Every year she makes us a sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his"
5838,"own, “and mine’s always maroon.”"
5839,"“That’s really nice of her,” said Harry, trying the fudge, which"
5840,was very tasty.
5841,His next present also contained candy — a large box of Choco-
5842,late Frogs from Hermione.
5843,This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was
5844,very light. He unwrapped it.
5845,Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor
5846,where it lay in gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
5847,"“I’ve heard of those,” he said in a hushed voice, dropping the"
5848,box of Every Flavor Beans he’d gotten from Hermione. “If that’s
5849,"what I think it is — they’re really rare, and really valuable.”"
5850,“What is it?”
5851,"Harry picked the shining, silvery cloth off the floor. It was"
5852,"strange to the touch, like water woven into material."
5853,"“It’s an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, a look of awe on his face."
5854,“I’m sure it is — try it on.”
5855,Harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.
5856,“It is! Look down!”
5857,"Harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone. He dashed"
5858,"to the mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back at him, just"
5859,"his head suspended in midair, his body completely invisible. He"
5860,pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished com-
5861,pletely.
5862,“There’s a note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out of it!”
5863,Harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter. Written in nar-
5864,"row, loopy writing he had never seen before were the following"
5865,words:
5866,  201  
5867,CHAPTER TWELVE
5868,Your father left this in my possession before
5869,he died. It is time it was returned to you.
5870,Use it well.
5871,A Very Merry Christmas to you.
5872,There was no signature. Harry stared at the note. Ron was admir-
5873,ing the cloak.
5874,"“I’d give anything for one of these,” he said. “Anything. What’s"
5875,the matter?”
5876,"“Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent the"
5877,cloak? Had it really once belonged to his father?
5878,"Before he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door"
5879,was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry
5880,stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight. He didn’t feel like sharing it
5881,with anyone else yet.
5882,“Merry Christmas!”
5883,"“Hey, look — Harry’s got a Weasley sweater, too!”"
5884,"Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one with a large"
5885,"yellow F on it, the other a G."
5886,"“Harry’s is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up"
5887,Harry’s sweater. “She obviously makes more of an effort if you’re
5888,not family.”
5889,"“Why aren’t you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded."
5890,"“Come on, get it on, they’re lovely and warm.”"
5891,"“I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over"
5892,his head.
5893,"“You haven’t got a letter on yours,” George observed. “I suppose"
5894,she thinks you don’t forget your name. But we’re not stupid — we
5895,know we’re called Gred and Forge.”
5896,  202    
5897,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
5898,“What’s all this noise?”
5899,"Percy Weasley stuck his head through the door, looking disap-"
5900,proving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his
5901,"presents as he, too, carried a lumpy sweater over his arm, which"
5902,Fred seized.
5903,"“P for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we’re all wearing ours,"
5904,even Harry got one.”
5905,"“I — don’t — want —” said Percy thickly, as the twins forced"
5906,"the sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew."
5907,"“And you’re not sitting with the prefects today, either,” said"
5908,George. “Christmas is a time for family.”
5909,"They frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his"
5910,side by his sweater.
5911,Harry had never in all his life had such a Christmas dinner. A hun-
5912,"dred fat, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and boiled potatoes;"
5913,"platters of chipolatas; tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick,"
5914,rich gravy and cranberry sauce — and stacks of wizard crackers
5915,every few feet along the table. These fantastic party favors were
5916,"nothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought,"
5917,with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside.
5918,"Harry pulled a wizard cracker with Fred and it didn’t just bang, it"
5919,went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud
5920,"of blue smoke, while from the inside exploded a rear admiral’s hat"
5921,"and several live, white mice. Up at the High Table, Dumbledore"
5922,"had swapped his pointed wizard’s hat for a flowered bonnet, and"
5923,was chuckling merrily at a joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.
5924,Flaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly
5925,broke his teeth on a silver Sickle embedded in his slice. Harry
5926,  203  
5927,CHAPTER TWELVE
5928,watched Hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called
5929,"for more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall on the cheek,"
5930,"who, to Harry’s amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lop-"
5931,sided.
5932,"When Harry finally left the table, he was laden down with a"
5933,"stack of things out of the crackers, including a pack of non-"
5934,"explodable, luminous balloons, a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and"
5935,his own new wizard chess set. The white mice had disappeared and
5936,Harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as Mrs. Nor-
5937,ris’s Christmas dinner.
5938,Harry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furi-
5939,"ous snowball fight on the grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping"
5940,"for breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common"
5941,"room, where Harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacu-"
5942,larly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn’t have lost so badly if Percy
5943,hadn’t tried to help him so much.
5944,"After a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christ-"
5945,"mas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed"
5946,except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over
5947,Gryffindor Tower because they’d stolen his prefect badge.
5948,It had been Harry’s best Christmas day ever. Yet something had
5949,been nagging at the back of his mind all day. Not until he climbed
5950,into bed was he free to think about it: the Invisibility Cloak and
5951,whoever had sent it.
5952,"Ron, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to"
5953,"bother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he’d drawn the curtains of"
5954,his four-poster. Harry leaned over the side of his own bed and
5955,pulled the cloak out from under it.
5956, 204  
5957,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
5958,His father’s . . . this had been his father’s. He let the material
5959,"flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the"
5960,note had said.
5961,"He had to try it, now. He slipped out of bed and wrapped the"
5962,"cloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moon-"
5963,light and shadows. It was a very funny feeling.
5964,Use it well.
5965,"Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was"
5966,open to him in this cloak. Excitement flooded through him as he
5967,"stood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this,"
5968,"anywhere, and Filch would never know."
5969,Ron grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something
5970,held him back — his father’s cloak — he felt that this time — the
5971,first time — he wanted to use it alone.
5972,"He crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the com-"
5973,"mon room, and climbed through the portrait hole."
5974,“Who’s there?” squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He
5975,walked quickly down the corridor.
5976,"Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought."
5977,And then it came to him. The Restricted Section in the library.
5978,"He’d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out"
5979,"who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight"
5980,around him as he walked.
5981,The library was pitch-black and very eerie. Harry lit a lamp to
5982,see his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was
5983,"floating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm"

5985,The Restricted Section was right at the back of the library. Step-

5987,CHAPTER TWELVE
5988,ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the
5989,"rest of the library, he held up his lamp to read the titles."
5990,"They didn’t tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters"
5991,spelled words in languages Harry couldn’t understand. Some had
5992,no title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly
5993,like blood. The hairs on the back of Harry’s neck prickled. Maybe
5994,"he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering"
5995,"was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was"
5996,there who shouldn’t be.
5997,He had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully
5998,"on the floor, he looked along the bottom shelf for an interesting-"
5999,looking book. A large black and silver volume caught his eye. He
6000,"pulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balanc-"
6001,"ing it on his knee, let it fall open."
6002,"A piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence — the book"
6003,"was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but the shriek went on and"
6004,"on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward"
6005,"and knocked over his lamp, which went out at once. Panicking, he"
6006,heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside — stuffing the
6007,"shrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in"
6008,"the doorway; Filch’s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him,"
6009,and Harry slipped under Filch’s outstretched arm and streaked off
6010,"up the corridor, the book’s shrieks still ringing in his ears."
6011,He came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had
6012,"been so busy getting away from the library, he hadn’t paid attention"
6013,"to where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn’t rec-"
6014,ognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the
6015,"kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there."

6018,"“You asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was"
6019,"wandering around at night, and somebody’s been in the library —"
6020,Restricted Section.”
6021,"Harry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was,"
6022,"Filch must know a shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was get-"
6023,"ting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Re-"
6024,"stricted Section? Well, they can’t be far, we’ll catch them.”"
6025,Harry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around
6026,"the corner ahead. They couldn’t see him, of course, but it was a nar-"
6027,row corridor and if they came much nearer they’d knock right into
6028,him — the cloak didn’t stop him from being solid.
6029,He backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his
6030,"left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his"
6031,"breath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get in-"
6032,side the room without their noticing anything. They walked
6033,"straight past, and Harry leaned against the wall, breathing deeply,"
6034,"listening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very"
6035,close. It was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the
6036,room he had hidden in.
6037,It looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks
6038,"and chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned"
6039,wastepaper basket — but propped against the wall facing him
6040,"was something that didn’t look as if it belonged there, something"
6041,that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the
6042,way.
6043,"It was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate"
6044,"gold frame, standing on two clawed feet. There was an inscription"
6045,carved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.
6046,  207   
6047,CHAPTER TWELVE
6048,His panic fading now that there was no sound of Filch and
6049,"Snape, Harry moved nearer to the mirror, wanting to look at him-"
6050,self but see no reflection again. He stepped in front of it.
6051,He had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from
6052,screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more
6053,furiously than when the book had screamed — for he had seen not
6054,"only himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing"
6055,right behind him.
6056,"But the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly"
6057,back to the mirror.
6058,"There he was, reflected in it, white and scared-looking, and"
6059,"there, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked"
6060,"over his shoulder — but still, no one was there. Or were they all in-"
6061,"visible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and"
6062,"this mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?"
6063,He looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind
6064,his reflection was smiling at him and waving. He reached out a
6065,"hand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he’d touch"
6066,"her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air —"
6067,she and the others existed only in the mirror.
6068,She was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her
6069,"eyes — her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little"
6070,"closer to the glass. Bright green — exactly the same shape, but then"
6071,"he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying at the same"
6072,"time. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his"
6073,"arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It"
6074,"stuck up at the back, just as Harry’s did."
6075,Harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly
6076,touching that of his reflection.
6077,  208  
6078,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
6079,“Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”
6080,"They just looked at him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked into"
6081,"the faces of the other people in the mirror, and saw other pairs of"
6082,"green eyes like his, other noses like his, even a little old man who"
6083,looked as though he had Harry’s knobbly knees — Harry was
6084,"looking at his family, for the first time in his life."
6085,The Potters smiled and waved at Harry and he stared hungrily
6086,"back at them, his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he"
6087,was hoping to fall right through it and reach them. He had a pow-
6088,"erful kind of ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness."
6089,"How long he stood there, he didn’t know. The reflections did"
6090,not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought
6091,"him back to his senses. He couldn’t stay here, he had to find his way"
6092,"back to bed. He tore his eyes away from his mother’s face, whis-"
6093,"pered, “I’ll come back,” and hurried from the room."
6094,"“You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly."
6095,"“You can come tonight, I’m going back, I want to show you the"
6096,mirror.”
6097,"“I’d like to see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly."
6098,"“And I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you’ll be able"
6099,to show me your other brothers and everyone.”
6100,"“You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round"
6101,"my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people."
6102,"Shame about not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or"
6103,"something, why aren’t you eating anything?”"
6104,Harry couldn’t eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing
6105,them again tonight. He had almost forgotten about Flamel. It
6106,didn’t seem very important anymore. Who cared what the three-
6107,  209   
6108,CHAPTER TWELVE
6109,"headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it,"
6110,really?
6111,“Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”
6112,What Harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the
6113,"mirror room again. With Ron covered in the cloak, too, they had"
6114,to walk much more slowly the next night. They tried retracing
6115,"Harry’s route from the library, wandering around the dark passage-"
6116,ways for nearly an hour.
6117,"“I’m freezing,” said Ron. “Let’s forget it and go back.”"
6118,“No!” Harry hissed. “I know it’s here somewhere.”
6119,They passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite di-
6120,"rection, but saw no one else. Just as Ron started moaning that his"
6121,"feet were dead with cold, Harry spotted the suit of armor."
6122,“It’s here — just here — yes!”
6123,They pushed the door open. Harry dropped the cloak from
6124,around his shoulders and ran to the mirror.
6125,There they were. His mother and father beamed at the sight of
6126,him.
6127,“See?” Harry whispered.
6128,“I can’t see anything.”
6129,“Look! Look at them all . . . there are loads of them. . . .”
6130,“I can only see you.”
6131,"“Look in it properly, go on, stand where I am.”"
6132,"Harry stepped aside, but with Ron in front of the mirror, he"
6133,"couldn’t see his family anymore, just Ron in his paisley pajamas."
6134,"Ron, though, was staring transfixed at his image."
6135,“Look at me!” he said.
6136,“Can you see all your family standing around you?”
6137,  210   
6138,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
6139,“No — I’m alone — but I’m different — I look older — and I’m
6140,Head Boy!”
6141,“What?”
6142,“I am — I’m wearing the badge like Bill used to — and I’m
6143,holding the House Cup and the Quidditch Cup — I’m Quidditch
6144,"captain, too!”"
6145,Ron tore his eyes away from this splendid sight to look excitedly
6146,at Harry.
6147,“Do you think this mirror shows the future?”
6148,“How can it? All my family are dead — let me have another
6149,look —”
6150,"“You had it to yourself all last night, give me a bit more time.”"
6151,"“You’re only holding the Quidditch Cup, what’s interesting"
6152,about that? I want to see my parents.”
6153,“Don’t push me —”
6154,A sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their dis-
6155,cussion. They hadn’t realized how loudly they had been talking.
6156,“Quick!”
6157,Ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of
6158,"Mrs. Norris came round the door. Ron and Harry stood quite still,"
6159,both thinking the same thing — did the cloak work on cats? After
6160,"what seemed an age, she turned and left."
6161,"“This isn’t safe — she might have gone for Filch, I bet she heard"
6162,us. Come on.”
6163,And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
6164,The snow still hadn’t melted the next morning.
6165,"“Want to play chess, Harry?” said Ron."
6166,“No.”
6167,  211  
6168,CHAPTER TWELVE
6169,“Why don’t we go down and visit Hagrid?”
6170,“No . . . you go . . .”
6171,"“I know what you’re thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don’t"
6172,go back tonight.”
6173,“Why not?”
6174,"“I dunno, I’ve just got a bad feeling about it — and anyway,"
6175,"you’ve had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs."
6176,Norris are wandering around. So what if they can’t see you? What
6177,if they walk into you? What if you knock something over?”
6178,“You sound like Hermione.”
6179,"“I’m serious, Harry, don’t go.”"
6180,"But Harry only had one thought in his head, which was to get"
6181,"back in front of the mirror, and Ron wasn’t going to stop him."
6182,That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He
6183,was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was
6184,"wise, but he didn’t meet anyone."
6185,"And there were his mother and father smiling at him again, and"
6186,one of his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down to sit on
6187,the floor in front of the mirror. There was nothing to stop him from
6188,staying here all night with his family. Nothing at all.
6189,Except —
6190,"“So — back again, Harry?”"
6191,Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice. He looked be-
6192,hind him. Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other
6193,than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past
6194,"him, so desperate to get to the mirror he hadn’t noticed him."
6195,"“I — I didn’t see you, sir.”"
6196, 212  
6197,THE MIRROR OF ERISED
6198,"“Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said"
6199,"Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved to see that he was smiling."
6200,"“So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to sit on the floor"
6201,"with Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered the"
6202,delights of the Mirror of Erised.”
6203,"“I didn’t know it was called that, sir.”"
6204,“But I expect you’ve realized by now what it does?”
6205,“It — well — it shows me my family —”
6206,“And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.”
6207,“How did you know — ?”
6208,"“I don’t need a cloak to become invisible,” said Dumbledore"
6209,"gently. “Now, can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us"
6210,all?”
6211,Harry shook his head.
6212,“Let me explain. The happiest man on earth would be able to
6213,"use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look"
6214,into it and see himself exactly as he is. Does that help?”
6215,"Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we"
6216,want . . . whatever we want . . .”
6217,"“Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing"
6218,"more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts."
6219,"You, who have never known your family, see them standing around"
6220,"you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his"
6221,"brothers, sees himself standing alone, the best of all of them. How-"
6222,"ever, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have"
6223,"wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been"
6224,"driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible."
6225,"“The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow, Harry,"

6228,and I ask you not to go looking for it again. If you ever do run
6229,"across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do to dwell on"
6230,"dreams and forget to live, remember that. Now, why don’t you put"
6231,that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed?”
6232,Harry stood up.
6233,“Sir — Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
6234,"“Obviously, you’ve just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may"
6235,"ask me one more thing, however.”"
6236,“What do you see when you look in the mirror?”
6237,"“I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.”"
6238,Harry stared.
6239,"“One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “An-"
6240,other Christmas has come and gone and I didn’t get a single pair.
6241,People will insist on giving me books.”
6242,It was only when he was back in bed that it struck Harry that
6243,"Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he"
6244,"thought, as he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite a"
6245,personal question.

6248,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6249,D       umbledore had convinced Harry not to go looking for the
6250,"Mirror of Erised again, and for the rest of the Christmas"
6251,holidays the Invisibility Cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his
6252,trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror
6253,"as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and"
6254,over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of
6255,"green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter."
6256,"“You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you"
6257,"mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him about these dreams."
6258,"Hermione, who came back the day before term started, took a"
6259,different view of things. She was torn between horror at the idea of
6260,"Harry being out of bed, roaming the school three nights in a row"
6261,"(“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn’t at"
6262,least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
6263,They had almost given up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li-
6264,215
6265,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
6266,"brary book, even though Harry was still sure he’d read the name"
6267,"somewhere. Once term had started, they were back to skimming"
6268,through books for ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even
6269,"less time than the other two, because Quidditch practice had"
6270,started again.
6271,Wood was working the team harder than ever. Even the endless
6272,rain that had replaced the snow couldn’t dampen his spirits. The
6273,"Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming a fanatic, but"
6274,"Harry was on Wood’s side. If they won their next match, against"
6275,"Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin in the House Champi-"
6276,onship for the first time in seven years. Quite apart from wanting
6277,"to win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired"
6278,out after training.
6279,"Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session,"
6280,Wood gave the team a bit of bad news. He’d just gotten very angry
6281,"with the Weasleys, who kept dive-bombing each other and pre-"
6282,tending to fall off their brooms.
6283,“Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That’s exactly
6284,the sort of thing that’ll lose us the match! Snape’s refereeing this
6285,"time, and he’ll be looking for any excuse to knock points off"
6286,Gryffindor!”
6287,George Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words.
6288,“Snape’s refereeing?” he spluttered through a mouthful of mud.
6289,“When’s he ever refereed a Quidditch match? He’s not going to be
6290,fair if we might overtake Slytherin.”
6291,"The rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too."
6292,"“It’s not my fault,” said Wood. “We’ve just got to make sure we"
6293,"play a clean game, so Snape hasn’t got an excuse to pick on us.”"
6294,216
6295,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6296,"Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another rea-"
6297,son for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quid-
6298,ditch. . . .
6299,The rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at
6300,"the end of practice, but Harry headed straight back to the Gryf-"
6301,"findor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing"
6302,"chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something"
6303,Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.
6304,"“Don’t talk to me for a moment,” said Ron when Harry sat"
6305,"down next to him, “I need to concen-” He caught sight of"
6306,Harry’s face. “What’s the matter with you? You look terrible.”
6307,"Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the"
6308,"other two about Snape’s sudden, sinister desire to be a Quidditch"
6309,referee.
6310,"“Don’t play,” said Hermione at once."
6311,"“Say you’re ill,” said Ron."
6312,"“Pretend to break your leg,” Hermione suggested."
6313,"“Really break your leg,” said Ron."
6314,"“I can’t,” said Harry. “There isn’t a reserve Seeker. If I back out,"
6315,Gryffindor can’t play at all.”
6316,At that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How
6317,he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone’s
6318,"guess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they"
6319,recognized at once as the Leg-Locker Curse. He must have had to
6320,bunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower.
6321,"Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and"
6322,performed the countercurse. Neville’s legs sprang apart and he got
6323,"to his feet, trembling."
6324,217
6325,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
6326,"“What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over to sit"
6327,with Harry and Ron.
6328,"“Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside the library. He"
6329,said he’d been looking for someone to practice that on.”
6330,“Go to Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Re-
6331,port him!”
6332,Neville shook his head.
6333,"“I don’t want more trouble,” he mumbled."
6334,"“You’ve got to stand up to him, Neville!” said Ron. “He’s used to"
6335,"walking all over people, but that’s no reason to lie down in front of"
6336,him and make it easier.”
6337,“There’s no need to tell me I’m not brave enough to be in
6338,"Gryffindor, Malfoy’s already done that,” Neville choked out."
6339,Harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a Chocolate
6340,"Frog, the very last one from the box Hermione had given him for"
6341,"Christmas. He gave it to Neville, who looked as though he might"
6342,cry.
6343,"“You’re worth twelve of Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat"
6344,"chose you for Gryffindor, didn’t it? And where’s Malfoy? In stink-"
6345,ing Slytherin.”
6346,Neville’s lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog.
6347,"“Thanks, Harry . . . I think I’ll go to bed. . . . D’you want the"
6348,"card, you collect them, don’t you?”"
6349,"As Neville walked away, Harry looked at the Famous Wizard"
6350,card.
6351,"“Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was the first one I ever —”"
6352,He gasped. He stared at the back of the card. Then he looked up
6353,at Ron and Hermione.
6354,218
6355,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6356,“I’ve found him!” he whispered. “I’ve found Flamel! I told you I’d
6357,"read the name somewhere before, I read it on the train coming"
6358,here — listen to this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
6359,"defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery"
6360,"of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on alchemy with"
6361,"his partner, Nicolas Flamel ’!”"
6362,Hermione jumped to her feet. She hadn’t looked so excited
6363,since they’d gotten back the marks for their very first piece of
6364,homework.
6365,"“Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls’"
6366,dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time to exchange mystified
6367,"looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book in her"
6368,arms.
6369,“I never thought to look in here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got
6370,this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading.”
6371,"“Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him to be quiet until she’d"
6372,"looked something up, and started flicking frantically through the"
6373,"pages, muttering to herself."
6374,At last she found what she was looking for.
6375,“I knew it! I knew it!”
6376,“Are we allowed to speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ig-
6377,nored him.
6378,"“Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is the only known"
6379,maker of the Sorcerer’s Stone!”
6380,This didn’t have quite the effect she’d expected.
6381,“The what?” said Harry and Ron.
6382,"“Oh, honestly, don’t you two read? Look — read that, there.”"
6383,"She pushed the book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:"

6385,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
6386,The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with mak-
6387,"ing the Sorcerer’s Stone, a legendary substance with as-"
6388,tonishing powers. The Stone will transform any metal
6389,"into pure gold. It also produces the Elixir of Life,"
6390,which will make the drinker immortal.
6391,There have been many reports of the Sorcerer’s
6392,"Stone over the centuries, but the only Stone currently"
6393,"in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the noted"
6394,"alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who cele-"
6395,brated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last
6396,"year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife,"
6397,Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight).
6398,"“See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The"
6399,dog must be guarding Flamel’s Sorcerer’s Stone! I bet he asked
6400,"Dumbledore to keep it safe for him, because they’re friends and he"
6401,"knew someone was after it, that’s why he wanted the Stone moved"
6402,out of Gringotts!”
6403,“A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying!” said
6404,Harry. “No wonder Snape’s after it! Anyone would want it.”
6405,“And no wonder we couldn’t find Flamel in that Study of Recent
6406,"Developments in Wizardry,” said Ron. “He’s not exactly recent if he’s"
6407,"six hundred and sixty-five, is he?”"
6408,"The next morning in Defense Against the Dark Arts, while copy-"
6409,"ing down different ways of treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron"
6410,were still discussing what they’d do with a Sorcerer’s Stone if they
6411,had one. It wasn’t until Ron said he’d buy his own Quidditch team
6412,that Harry remembered about Snape and the coming match.
6413,220
6414,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6415,"“I’m going to play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don’t, all"
6416,the Slytherins will think I’m just too scared to face Snape. I’ll show
6417,them . . . it’ll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.”
6418,"“Just as long as we’re not wiping you off the field,” said Her-"
6419,mione.
6420,"As the match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more"
6421,"nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. The rest of the team"
6422,"wasn’t too calm, either. The idea of overtaking Slytherin in the"
6423,"House Championship was wonderful, no one had done it for seven"
6424,"years, but would they be allowed to, with such a biased referee?"
6425,"Harry didn’t know whether he was imagining it or not, but he"
6426,"seemed to keep running into Snape wherever he went. At times, he"
6427,"even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch"
6428,him on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly
6429,"torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry. Could Snape possibly"
6430,know they’d found out about the Sorcerer’s Stone? Harry didn’t see
6431,how he could — yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that
6432,Snape could read minds.
6433,"Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside the locker"
6434,"rooms the next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wonder-"
6435,ing whether they’d ever see him alive again. This wasn’t what you’d
6436,call comforting. Harry hardly heard a word of Wood’s pep talk as
6437,he pulled on his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two
6438,Thousand.
6439,"Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found a place in the stands"
6440,"next to Neville, who couldn’t understand why they looked so grim"
6441,"and worried, or why they had both brought their wands to the"
6442,221
6443,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
6444,match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been
6445,secretly practicing the Leg-Locker Curse. They’d gotten the idea
6446,"from Malfoy using it on Neville, and were ready to use it on Snape"
6447,if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt Harry.
6448,"“Now, don’t forget, it’s Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered as"
6449,Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.
6450,"“I know,” Ron snapped. “Don’t nag.”"
6451,"Back in the locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside."
6452,"“Don’t want to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early"
6453,capture of the Snitch it’s now. Finish the game before Snape can fa-
6454,vor Hufflepuff too much.”
6455,"“The whole school’s out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out of"
6456,the door. “Even — blimey — Dumbledore’s come to watch!”
6457,Harry’s heart did a somersault.
6458,"“Dumbledore?” he said, dashing to the door to make sure. Fred"
6459,was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.
6460,Harry could have laughed out loud with relief. He was safe.
6461,There was simply no way that Snape would dare to try to hurt him
6462,if Dumbledore was watching.
6463,Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry as the teams
6464,"marched onto the field, something that Ron noticed, too."
6465,"“I’ve never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione."
6466,“Look — they’re off. Ouch!”
6467,Someone had poked Ron in the back of the head. It was Malfoy.
6468,"“Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn’t see you there.”"
6469,Malfoy grinned broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.
6470,“Wonder how long Potter’s going to stay on his broom this time?
6471,"Anyone want a bet? What about you, Weasley?”"
6472,222
6473,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6474,Ron didn’t answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff a penalty
6475,"because George Weasley had hit a Bludger at him. Hermione, who"
6476,"had all her fingers crossed in her lap, was squinting fixedly at Harry,"
6477,"who was circling the game like a hawk, looking for the Snitch."
6478,“You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor
6479,"team?” said Malfoy loudly a few minutes later, as Snape awarded"
6480,Hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all. “It’s people they
6481,"feel sorry for. See, there’s Potter, who’s got no parents, then there’s"
6482,"the Weasleys, who’ve got no money — you should be on the team,"
6483,"Longbottom, you’ve got no brains.”"
6484,Neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face Malfoy.
6485,"“I’m worth twelve of you, Malfoy,” he stammered."
6486,"Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ron, still"
6487,"not daring to take his eyes from the game, said, “You tell him,"
6488,Neville.”
6489,"“Longbottom, if brains were gold you’d be poorer than Weasley,"
6490,and that’s saying something.”
6491,Ron’s nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with
6492,anxiety about Harry.
6493,"“I’m warning you, Malfoy — one more word —”"
6494,"“Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry — !”"
6495,“What? Where?”
6496,"Harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive, which drew"
6497,"gasps and cheers from the crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed"
6498,"fingers in her mouth, as Harry streaked toward the ground like a"
6499,bullet.
6500,"“You’re in luck, Weasley, Potter’s obviously spotted some money"
6501,on the ground!” said Malfoy.
6502,223
6503,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
6504,"Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron"
6505,"was on top of him, wrestling him to the ground. Neville hesitated,"
6506,then clambered over the back of his seat to help.
6507,"“Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat"
6508,to watch as Harry sped straight at Snape — she didn’t even notice
6509,"Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or the scuffles and"
6510,"yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and"
6511,Goyle.
6512,"Up in the air, Snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see"
6513,"something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches — the"
6514,"next second, Harry had pulled out of the dive, his arm raised in tri-"
6515,"umph, the Snitch clasped in his hand."
6516,"The stands erupted; it had to be a record, no one could ever re-"
6517,member the Snitch being caught so quickly.
6518,“Ron! Ron! Where are you? The game’s over! Harry’s won! We’ve
6519,"won! Gryffindor is in the lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing"
6520,up and down on her seat and hugging Parvati Patil in the row in
6521,front.
6522,"Harry jumped off his broom, a foot from the ground. He"
6523,couldn’t believe it. He’d done it — the game was over; it had barely
6524,"lasted five minutes. As Gryffindors came spilling onto the field, he"
6525,"saw Snape land nearby, white-faced and tight-lipped — then"
6526,Harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into Dumble-
6527,dore’s smiling face.
6528,"“Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could"
6529,hear. “Nice to see you haven’t been brooding about that mirror . . .
6530,been keeping busy . . . excellent . . .”
6531,Snape spat bitterly on the ground.
6532,224
6533,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6534,"Harry left the locker room alone some time later, to take his Nim-"
6535,bus Two Thousand back to the broomshed. He couldn’t ever re-
6536,member feeling happier. He’d really done something to be proud of
6537,now — no one could say he was just a famous name any more. The
6538,evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over the damp
6539,"grass, reliving the last hour in his head, which was a happy blur:"
6540,Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and
6541,"Hermione in the distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering"
6542,through a heavy nosebleed.
6543,Harry had reached the shed. He leaned against the wooden door
6544,"and looked up at Hogwarts, with its windows glowing red in the"
6545,"setting sun. Gryffindor in the lead. He’d done it, he’d shown"
6546,Snape. . . .
6547,And speaking of Snape . . .
6548,A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle.
6549,"Clearly not wanting to be seen, it walked as fast as possible toward"
6550,the forbidden forest. Harry’s victory faded from his mind as he
6551,"watched. He recognized the figure’s prowling walk. Snape, sneak-"
6552,ing into the forest while everyone else was at dinner — what was
6553,going on?
6554,Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off.
6555,Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a
6556,run. He followed.
6557,The trees were so thick he couldn’t see where Snape had gone.
6558,"He flew in circles, lower and lower, brushing the top branches of"
6559,trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed
6560,noiselessly in a towering beech tree.
6561,"He climbed carefully along one of the branches, holding tight to"
6562,"his broomstick, trying to see through the leaves."
6563,225
6564,CHAPTER THIRTEEN
6565,"Below, in a shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn’t alone."
6566,"Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn’t make out the look on his"
6567,"face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained to catch"
6568,what they were saying.
6569,“. . . d-don’t know why you wanted t-t-to meet here of all
6570,"p-places, Severus . . .”"
6571,"“Oh, I thought we’d keep this private,” said Snape, his voice"
6572,"icy. “Students aren’t supposed to know about the Sorcerer’s Stone,"
6573,after all.”
6574,Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something.
6575,Snape interrupted him.
6576,“Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid’s yet?”
6577,"“B-b-but Severus, I —”"
6578,"“You don’t want me as your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking"
6579,a step toward him.
6580,“I-I don’t know what you —”
6581,“You know perfectly well what I mean.”
6582,"An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out of the tree. He"
6583,"steadied himself in time to hear Snape say, “— your little bit of"
6584,hocus-pocus. I’m waiting.”
6585,“B-but I d-d-don’t —”
6586,"“Very well,” Snape cut in. “We’ll have another little chat soon,"
6587,when you’ve had time to think things over and decided where your
6588,loyalties lie.”
6589,He threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing.
6590,"It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing"
6591,quite still as though he was petrified.
6592,226
6593,NICHOLAS FLAMEL
6594,"“Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked."
6595,"“We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry"
6596,"on the back. “And I gave Malfoy a black eye, and Neville tried to"
6597,take on Crabbe and Goyle single-handed! He’s still out cold but
6598,Madam Pomfrey says he’ll be all right — talk about showing
6599,"Slytherin! Everyone’s waiting for you in the common room, we’re"
6600,"having a party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from"
6601,the kitchens.”
6602,"“Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let’s find an"
6603,"empty room, you wait ’til you hear this. . . .”"
6604,He made sure Peeves wasn’t inside before shutting the door be-
6605,"hind them, then he told them what he’d seen and heard."
6606,"“So we were right, it is the Sorcerer’s Stone, and Snape’s trying to"
6607,force Quirrell to help him get it. He asked if he knew how to get
6608,past Fluffy — and he said something about Quirrell’s ‘hocus-
6609,pocus’ — I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart
6610,"from Fluffy, loads of enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would"
6611,have done some anti-Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break
6612,through —”
6613,“So you mean the Stone’s only safe as long as Quirrell stands up
6614,to Snape?” said Hermione in alarm.
6615,"“It’ll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron."

6620,"Q       uirrell, however, must have been braver than they’d"
6621,thought. In the weeks that followed he did seem to be get-
6622,"ting paler and thinner, but it didn’t look as though he’d cracked yet."
6623,"Every time they passed the third-floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and"
6624,Hermione would press their ears to the door to check that Fluffy
6625,was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping about in his usual
6626,"bad temper, which surely meant that the Stone was still safe."
6627,Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an en-
6628,"couraging sort of smile, and Ron had started telling people off for"
6629,laughing at Quirrell’s stutter.
6630,"Hermione, however, had more on her mind than the Sorcerer’s"
6631,Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and color-
6632,"coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn’t have minded, but"
6633,she kept nagging them to do the same.
6634,"“Hermione, the exams are ages away.”"
6635, 228   
6636,NORBERT THE
6637,NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
6638,"“Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That’s not ages, that’s like a"
6639,second to Nicolas Flamel.”
6640,"“But we’re not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Any-"
6641,"way, what are you studying for, you already know it all.”"
6642,“What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need to
6643,pass these exams to get into the second year? They’re very impor-
6644,"tant, I should have started studying a month ago, I don’t know"
6645,what’s gotten into me.
6646,"Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to be thinking along the"
6647,same lines as Hermione. They piled so much homework on them
6648,that the Easter holidays weren’t nearly as much fun as the Christ-
6649,mas ones. It was hard to relax with Hermione next to you reciting the
6650,twelve uses of dragon’s blood or practicing wand movements. Moan-
6651,"ing and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most of their free time in"
6652,"the library with her, trying to get through all their extra work."
6653,"“I’ll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throw-"
6654,ing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library win-
6655,dow. It was the first really fine day they’d had in months. The sky
6656,"was a clear, forget-me-not blue, and there was a feeling in the air of"
6657,summer coming.
6658,"Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” in One Thousand Magical"
6659,"Herbs and Fungi, didn’t look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid!"
6660,What are you doing in the library?”
6661,"Hagrid shuffled into view, hiding something behind his back."
6662,He looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat.
6663,"“Jus’ lookin’,” he said, in a shifty voice that got their interest at"
6664,once. “An’ what’re you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious.
6665,"“Yer not still lookin’ fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”"
6666, 229  
6667,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
6668,"“Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively."
6669,"“And we know what that dog’s guarding, it’s a Sorcerer’s St —”"
6670,“Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly to see if anyone was lis-
6671,"tening. “Don’ go shoutin’ about it, what’s the matter with yeh?”"
6672,"“There are a few things we wanted to ask you, as a matter of"
6673,"fact,” said Harry, “about what’s guarding the Stone apart from"
6674,Fluffy —”
6675,"“SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen — come an’ see me later,"
6676,"I’m not promisin’ I’ll tell yeh anythin’, mind, but don’ go rabbitin’"
6677,"about it in here, students aren’ s’pposed ter know. They’ll think I’ve"
6678,told yeh —”
6679,"“See you later, then,” said Harry."
6680,Hagrid shuffled off.
6681,“What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thought-
6682,fully.
6683,“Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?”
6684,"“I’m going to see what section he was in,” said Ron, who’d had"
6685,enough of working. He came back a minute later with a pile of
6686,books in his arms and slammed them down on the table.
6687,“Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff about
6688,dragons! Look at these: Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland;
6689,"From Egg to Inferno, A Dragon Keeper’s Guide.”"
6690,"“Hagrid’s always wanted a dragon, he told me so the first time I"
6691,"ever met him,” said Harry."
6692,"“But it’s against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was out-"
6693,"lawed by the Warlocks’ Convention of 1709, everyone knows that."
6694,It’s hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we’re keeping dragons
6695,"in the back garden — anyway, you can’t tame dragons, it’s dan-"

6700,mania.”
6701,“But there aren’t wild dragons in Britain?” said Harry.
6702,"“Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and"
6703,Hebridean Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them
6704,"up, I can tell you. Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles"
6705,"who’ve spotted them, to make them forget.”"
6706,“So what on earth’s Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
6707,When they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper’s hut an hour
6708,"later, they were surprised to see that all the curtains were closed."
6709,"Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut the"
6710,door quickly behind them.
6711,"It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such a warm day,"
6712,there was a blazing fire in the grate. Hagrid made them tea and of-
6713,"fered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused."
6714,“So — yeh wanted to ask me somethin’?”
6715,"“Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around the bush."
6716,“We were wondering if you could tell us what’s guarding the
6717,Sorcerer’s Stone apart from Fluffy.”
6718,Hagrid frowned at him.
6719,"“O’ course I can’t,” he said. “Number one, I don’ know meself."
6720,"Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I"
6721,could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen
6722,outta Gringotts — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all? Beats
6723,me how yeh even know abou’ Fluffy.”
6724,"“Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you"
6725,"do know, you know everything that goes on round here,” said"

6727,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
6728,"Hermione in a warm, flattering voice. Hagrid’s beard twitched"
6729,and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had
6730,"done the guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who"
6731,"Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from you.”"
6732,Hagrid’s chest swelled at these last words. Harry and Ron
6733,beamed at Hermione.
6734,"“Well, I don’ s’pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that . . . let’s see . . ."
6735,he borrowed Fluffy from me . . . then some o’ the teachers did
6736,enchantments . . . Professor Sprout — Professor Flitwick — Pro-
6737,"fessor McGonagall —” he ticked them off on his fingers, “Profes-"
6738,"sor Quirrell — an’ Dumbledore himself did somethin’, o’ course."
6739,"Hang on, I’ve forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”"
6740,“Snape?”
6741,"“Yeah — yer not still on abou’ that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped"
6742,"protect the Stone, he’s not about ter steal it.”"
6743,Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking the same as he
6744,"was. If Snape had been in on protecting the Stone, it must have"
6745,been easy to find out how the other teachers had guarded it. He
6746,"probably knew everything — except, it seemed, Quirrell’s spell and"
6747,how to get past Fluffy.
6748,"“You’re the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren’t"
6749,"you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn’t tell any-"
6750,"one, would you? Not even one of the teachers?”"
6751,"“Not a soul knows except me an’ Dumbledore,” said Hagrid"
6752,proudly.
6753,"“Well, that’s something,” Harry muttered to the others. “Ha-"
6754,"grid, can we have a window open? I’m boiling.”"
6755,"“Can’t, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance at"

6760,“Hagrid — what’s that?”
6761,"But he already knew what it was. In the very heart of the fire, un-"
6762,"derneath the kettle, was a huge, black egg."
6763,"“Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously with his beard, “That’s —"
6764,er . . .”
6765,"“Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over"
6766,the fire to get a closer look at the egg. “It must’ve cost you a for-
6767,tune.”
6768,"“Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las’ night. I was down in the village"
6769,havin’ a few drinks an’ got into a game o’ cards with a stranger.
6770,"Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it, ter be honest.”"
6771,“But what are you going to do with it when it’s hatched?” said
6772,Hermione.
6773,"“Well, I’ve bin doin’ some readin’,” said Hagrid, pulling a large"
6774,book from under his pillow. “Got this outta the library — Dragon
6775,"Breeding for Pleasure and Profit — it’s a bit outta date, o’ course, but"
6776,"it’s all in here. Keep the egg in the fire, ’cause their mothers breathe"
6777,"on ’em, see, an’ when it hatches, feed it on a bucket o’ brandy"
6778,mixed with chicken blood every half hour. An’ see here — how ter
6779,recognize diff ’rent eggs — what I got there’s a Norwegian Ridge-
6780,"back. They’re rare, them.”"
6781,"He looked very pleased with himself, but Hermione didn’t."
6782,"“Hagrid, you live in a wooden house,” she said."
6783,But Hagrid wasn’t listening. He was humming merrily as he
6784,stoked the fire.
6785,So now they had something else to worry about: what might hap-
6786,pen to Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon
6787,in his hut.

6789,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
6790,"“Wonder what it’s like to have a peaceful life,” Ron sighed, as"
6791,evening after evening they struggled through all the extra home-
6792,work they were getting. Hermione had now started making study
6793,"schedules for Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts."
6794,"Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note"
6795,from Hagrid. He had written only two words: It’s hatching.
6796,Ron wanted to skip Herbology and go straight down to the hut.
6797,Hermione wouldn’t hear of it.
6798,"“Hermione, how many times in our lives are we going to see a"
6799,dragon hatching?”
6800,"“We’ve got lessons, we’ll get into trouble, and that’s nothing to"
6801,what Hagrid’s going to be in when someone finds out what he’s do-
6802,ing —”
6803,“Shut up!” Harry whispered.
6804,Malfoy was only a few feet away and he had stopped dead to lis-
6805,ten. How much had he heard? Harry didn’t like the look on Mal-
6806,foy’s face at all.
6807,Ron and Hermione argued all the way to Herbology and in the
6808,"end, Hermione agreed to run down to Hagrid’s with the other two"
6809,during morning break. When the bell sounded from the castle at
6810,"the end of their lesson, the three of them dropped their trowels at"
6811,once and hurried through the grounds to the edge of the forest.
6812,"Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited."
6813,“It’s nearly out.” He ushered them inside.
6814,The egg was lying on the table. There were deep cracks in it. Some-
6815,thing was moving inside; a funny clicking noise was coming from it.
6816,They all drew their chairs up to the table and watched with
6817,bated breath.
6818, 234   
6819,NORBERT THE
6820,NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
6821,All at once there was a scraping noise and the egg split open.
6822,The baby dragon flopped onto the table. It wasn’t exactly pretty;
6823,"Harry thought it looked like a crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny"
6824,"wings were huge compared to its skinny jet body, it had a long"
6825,"snout with wide nostrils, the stubs of horns and bulging, orange"
6826,eyes.
6827,It sneezed. A couple of sparks flew out of its snout.
6828,“Isn’t he beautiful ?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand
6829,"to stroke the dragon’s head. It snapped at his fingers, showing"
6830,pointed fangs.
6831,"“Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid."
6832,"“Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks"
6833,"grow, exactly?”"
6834,Hagrid was about to answer when the color suddenly drained
6835,from his face — he leapt to his feet and ran to the window.
6836,“What’s the matter?”
6837,“Someone was lookin’ through the gap in the curtains — it’s a
6838,kid — he’s runnin’ back up ter the school.”
6839,Harry bolted to the door and looked out. Even at a distance there
6840,was no mistaking him.
6841,Malfoy had seen the dragon.
6842,Something about the smile lurking on Malfoy’s face during the
6843,"next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They"
6844,"spent most of their free time in Hagrid’s darkened hut, trying to"
6845,reason with him.
6846,"“Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”"
6847,"“I can’t,” said Hagrid. “He’s too little. He’d die.”"
6848, 235   
6849,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
6850,They looked at the dragon. It had grown three times in length in
6851,just a week. Smoke kept furling out of its nostrils. Hagrid hadn’t
6852,been doing his gamekeeping duties because the dragon was keep-
6853,ing him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken
6854,feathers all over the floor.
6855,"“I’ve decided to call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking at the"
6856,"dragon with misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert!"
6857,Norbert! Where’s Mommy?”
6858,"“He’s lost his marbles,” Ron muttered in Harry’s ear."
6859,"“Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert’s"
6860,going to be as long as your house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledore
6861,at any moment.”
6862,Hagrid bit his lip.
6863,"“I — I know I can’t keep him forever, but I can’t jus’ dump him,"
6864,can’t.”
6865,Harry suddenly turned to Ron.
6866,"“Charlie,” he said."
6867,"“You’re losing it, too,” said Ron. “I’m Ron, remember?”"
6868,"“No — Charlie — your brother, Charlie. In Romania. Studying"
6869,dragons. We could send Norbert to him. Charlie can take care of
6870,him and then put him back in the wild!”
6871,"“Brilliant!” said Ron. “How about it, Hagrid?”"
6872,"And in the end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to"
6873,Charlie to ask him.
6874,The following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Her-
6875,"mione and Harry sitting alone in the common room, long after"
6876,everyone else had gone to bed. The clock on the wall had just
6877, 236  
6878,NORBERT THE
6879,NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
6880,chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared
6881,out of nowhere as he pulled off Harry’s Invisibility Cloak. He had
6882,"been down at Hagrid’s hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was"
6883,now eating dead rats by the crate.
6884,"“It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped"
6885,in a bloody handkerchief. “I’m not going to be able to hold a quill
6886,"for a week. I tell you, that dragon’s the most horrible animal I’ve"
6887,"ever met, but the way Hagrid goes on about it, you’d think it was a"
6888,fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off for fright-
6889,"ening it. And when I left, he was singing it a lullaby.”"
6890,There was a tap on the dark window.
6891,"“It’s Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying to let her in. “She’ll have"
6892,Charlie’s answer!”
6893,The three of them put their heads together to read the note.
6894,"Dear Ron,"
6895,How are you? Thanks for the letter — I’d be glad to take
6896,"the Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won’t be easy getting him"
6897,here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with
6898,some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week.
6899,"Trouble is, they mustn’t be seen carrying an illegal dragon."
6900,Could you get the Ridgeback up the tallest tower at mid-
6901,night on Saturday? They can meet you there and take him
6902,away while it’s still dark.
6903,Send me an answer as soon as possible.
6904,"Love,"
6905,Charlie
6906, 237 
6907,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
6908,They looked at one another.
6909,"“We’ve got the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn’t be"
6910,too difficult — I think the cloak’s big enough to cover two of us
6911,and Norbert.”
6912,It was a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two
6913,agreed with him. Anything to get rid of Norbert — and Malfoy.
6914,"There was a hitch. By the next morning, Ron’s bitten hand had"
6915,swollen to twice its usual size. He didn’t know whether it was safe
6916,to go to Madam Pomfrey — would she recognize a dragon bite? By
6917,"the afternoon, though, he had no choice. The cut had turned a"
6918,nasty shade of green. It looked as if Norbert’s fangs were poisonous.
6919,Harry and Hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end
6920,of the day to find Ron in a terrible state in bed.
6921,"“It’s not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like"
6922,it’s about to fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to
6923,borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh
6924,at me. He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me — I’ve
6925,"told her it was a dog, but I don’t think she believes me — I"
6926,"shouldn’t have hit him at the Quidditch match, that’s why he’s do-"
6927,ing this.”
6928,Harry and Hermione tried to calm Ron down.
6929,"“It’ll all be over at midnight on Saturday,” said Hermione, but"
6930,"this didn’t soothe Ron at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt upright"
6931,and broke into a sweat.
6932,“Midnight on Saturday!” he said in a hoarse voice. “Oh no —
6933,oh no — I’ve just remembered — Charlie’s letter was in that book
6934,"Malfoy took, he’s going to know we’re getting rid of Norbert.”"
6935, 238  
6936,NORBERT THE
6937,NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
6938,Harry and Hermione didn’t get a chance to answer. Madam
6939,"Pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave, saying"
6940,Ron needed sleep.
6941,"“It’s too late to change the plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We"
6942,"haven’t got time to send Charlie another owl, and this could be our"
6943,only chance to get rid of Norbert. We’ll have to risk it. And we have
6944,"got the Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn’t know about that.”"
6945,They found Fang the boarhound sitting outside with a ban-
6946,"daged tail when they went to tell Hagrid, who opened a window to"
6947,talk to them.
6948,"“I won’t let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert’s at a tricky stage —"
6949,nothin’ I can’t handle.”
6950,"When they told him about Charlie’s letter, his eyes filled with"
6951,"tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bit-"
6952,ten him on the leg.
6953,"“Aargh! It’s all right, he only got my boot — jus’ playin’ — he’s"
6954,"only a baby, after all.”"
6955,"The baby banged its tail on the wall, making the windows rattle."
6956,Harry and Hermione walked back to the castle feeling Saturday
6957,couldn’t come quickly enough.
6958,They would have felt sorry for Hagrid when the time came for him
6959,to say good-bye to Norbert if they hadn’t been so worried about
6960,"what they had to do. It was a very dark, cloudy night, and they"
6961,were a bit late arriving at Hagrid’s hut because they’d had to wait
6962,"for Peeves to get out of their way in the entrance hall, where he’d"
6963,been playing tennis against the wall.
6964, 239  
6965,CHAPTER FOURTEEN
6966,Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready in a large crate.
6967,"“He’s got lots o’ rats an’ some brandy fer the journey,” said Ha-"
6968,grid in a muffled voice. “An’ I’ve packed his teddy bear in case he
6969,gets lonely.”
6970,From inside the crate came ripping noises that sounded to Harry
6971,as though the teddy was having his head torn off.
6972,"“Bye-bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Hermione"
6973,covered the crate with the Invisibility Cloak and stepped under-
6974,neath it themselves. “Mommy will never forget you!”
6975,"How they managed to get the crate back up to the castle, they"
6976,never knew. Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved Norbert up the
6977,marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridors.
6978,"Up another staircase, then another — even one of Harry’s short-"
6979,cuts didn’t make the work much easier.
6980,“Nearly there!” Harry panted as they reached the corridor be-
6981,neath the tallest tower.
6982,Then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost
6983,"drop the crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they"
6984,"shrank into the shadows, staring at the dark outlines of two people"
6985,grappling with each other ten feet away. A lamp flared.
6986,"Professor McGonagall, in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net, had"
6987,Malfoy by the ear.
6988,“Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points from Slytherin!
6989,"Wandering around in the middle of the night, how dare you —”"
6990,"“You don’t understand, Professor. Harry Potter’s coming — he’s"
6991,got a dragon!”
6992,“What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on — I
6993,"shall see Professor Snape about you, Malfoy!”"
6994, 240  
6995,NORBERT THE
6996,NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
6997,The steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the
6998,easiest thing in the world after that. Not until they’d stepped out
6999,"into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak, glad to be able"
7000,to breathe properly again. Hermione did a sort of jig.
7001,“Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”
7002,"“Don’t,” Harry advised her."
7003,"Chuckling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing about"
7004,"in his crate. About ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swoop-"
7005,ing down out of the darkness.
7006,Charlie’s friends were a cheery lot. They showed Harry and
7007,"Hermione the harness they’d rigged up, so they could suspend"
7008,Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely into
7009,it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands with the others and
7010,thanked them very much.
7011,"At last, Norbert was going . . . going . . . gone."
7012,"They slipped back down the spiral staircase, their hearts as light"
7013,"as their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon —"
7014,Malfoy in detention — what could spoil their happiness?
7015,The answer to that was waiting at the foot of the stairs. As they
7016,"stepped into the corridor, Filch’s face loomed suddenly out of the"
7017,darkness.
7018,"“Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are in trouble.”"
7019,They’d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower.
7020, 241   
7021,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7022,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7023,T      hings couldn’t have been worse.
7024,Filch took them down to Professor McGonagall’s study
7025,"on the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word"
7026,"to each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild"
7027,"cover-up stories chased each other around Harry’s brain, each more"
7028,feeble than the last. He couldn’t see how they were going to get out
7029,of trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have
7030,been so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth
7031,that Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed
7032,"and creeping around the school in the dead of night, let alone be-"
7033,"ing up the tallest Astronomy Tower, which was out-of-bounds ex-"
7034,"cept for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they"
7035,might as well be packing their bags already.
7036,Had Harry thought that things couldn’t have been worse? He
7037,"was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading"
7038,Neville.
7039,  242  
7040,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7041,"“Harry!” Neville burst out, the moment he saw the other two. “I"
7042,"was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was"
7043,"going to catch you, he said you had a drag —”"
7044,"Harry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor"
7045,McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely to breathe fire than
7046,Norbert as she towered over the three of them.
7047,“I would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you
7048,were up in the Astronomy Tower. It’s one o’clock in the morning.
7049,Explain yourselves.”
7050,It was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a
7051,"teacher’s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue."
7052,"“I think I’ve got a good idea of what’s been going on,” said Pro-"
7053,fessor McGonagall. “It doesn’t take a genius to work it out. You fed
7054,"Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to"
7055,get him out of bed and into trouble. I’ve already caught him. I sup-
7056,pose you think it’s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and
7057,"believed it, too?”"
7058,Harry caught Neville’s eye and tried to tell him without words
7059,"that this wasn’t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt."
7060,"Poor, blundering Neville — Harry knew what it must have cost"
7061,"him to try and find them in the dark, to warn them."
7062,"“I’m disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out"
7063,"of bed in one night! I’ve never heard of such a thing before! You,"
7064,"Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Pot-"
7065,"ter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of"
7066,"you will receive detentions — yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom,"
7067,"nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, espe-"
7068,"cially these days, it’s very dangerous — and fifty points will be"
7069,taken from Gryffindor.”
7070, 243   
7071,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7072,"“Fifty?” Harry gasped — they would lose the lead, the lead he’d"
7073,won in the last Quidditch match.
7074,"“Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heav-"
7075,"ily through her long, pointed nose."
7076,“Professor — please —”
7077,“You can’t —”
7078,"“Don’t tell me what I can and can’t do, Potter. Now get back"
7079,"to bed, all of you. I’ve never been more ashamed of Gryffindor stu-"
7080,dents.”
7081,A hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor in last
7082,"place. In one night, they’d ruined any chance Gryffindor had had"
7083,for the House Cup. Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped
7084,out of his stomach. How could they ever make up for this?
7085,Harry didn’t sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing into
7086,his pillow for what seemed like hours. Harry couldn’t think of any-
7087,"thing to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was"
7088,dreading the dawn. What would happen when the rest of Gryf-
7089,findor found out what they’d done?
7090,"At first, Gryffindors passing the giant hourglasses that recorded"
7091,the House points the next day thought there’d been a mistake.
7092,How could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty points fewer
7093,"than yesterday? And then the story started to spread: Harry Potter,"
7094,"the famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had"
7095,"lost them all those points, him and a couple of other stupid first"
7096,years.
7097,From being one of the most popular and admired people at the
7098,"school, Harry was suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaws and"
7099,"Hufflepuffs turned on him, because everyone had been longing to"
7100,"see Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people"
7101, 244   
7102,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7103,pointed and didn’t trouble to lower their voices as they insulted
7104,"him. Slytherins, on the other hand, clapped as he walked past"
7105,"them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks Potter, we owe you one!”"
7106,Only Ron stood by him.
7107,“They’ll all forget this in a few weeks. Fred and George have lost
7108,"loads of points in all the time they’ve been here, and people still like"
7109,them.”
7110,"“They’ve never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go,"
7111,"though, have they?” said Harry miserably."
7112,"“Well — no,” Ron admitted."
7113,"It was a bit late to repair the damage, but Harry swore to himself"
7114,not to meddle in things that weren’t his business from now on.
7115,He’d had it with sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed
7116,of himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the
7117,Quidditch team.
7118,“Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good’ll that do? How are we
7119,going to get any points back if we can’t win at Quidditch?”
7120,But even Quidditch had lost its fun. The rest of the team
7121,"wouldn’t speak to Harry during practice, and if they had to speak"
7122,"about him, they called him “the Seeker.”"
7123,"Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn’t have as"
7124,"bad a time as Harry, because they weren’t as well-known, but no-"
7125,"body would speak to them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing"
7126,"attention to herself in class, keeping her head down and working in"
7127,silence.
7128,Harry was almost glad that the exams weren’t far away. All the
7129,"studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and"
7130,"Hermione kept to themselves, working late into the night, trying"
7131,"to remember the ingredients in complicated potions, learn charms"
7132,  245 
7133,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7134,"and spells by heart, memorize the dates of magical discoveries and"
7135,goblin rebellions. . . .
7136,"Then, about a week before the exams were due to start, Harry’s"
7137,new resolution not to interfere in anything that didn’t concern him
7138,was put to an unexpected test. Walking back from the library on
7139,"his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a"
7140,"classroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell’s voice."
7141,"“No — no — not again, please —”"
7142,It sounded as though someone was threatening him. Harry
7143,moved closer.
7144,“All right — all right —” he heard Quirrell sob.
7145,"Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom"
7146,straightening his turban. He was pale and looked as though he was
7147,about to cry. He strode out of sight; Harry didn’t think Quirrell
7148,had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell’s footsteps had dis-
7149,"appeared, then peered into the classroom. It was empty, but a door"
7150,stood ajar at the other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he
7151,remembered what he’d promised himself about not meddling.
7152,"All the same, he’d have gambled twelve Sorcerer’s Stones that"
7153,"Snape had just left the room, and from what Harry had just heard,"
7154,Snape would be walking with a new spring in his step — Quirrell
7155,seemed to have given in at last.
7156,"Harry went back to the library, where Hermione was testing"
7157,Ron on Astronomy. Harry told them what he’d heard.
7158,"“Snape’s done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell’s told him how to"
7159,break his Anti-Dark Force spell —”
7160,"“There’s still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione."
7161,“Maybe Snape’s found out how to get past him without asking
7162,"Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up at the thousands of books sur-"
7163, 246   
7164,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7165,rounding them. “I bet there’s a book somewhere in here telling you
7166,"how to get past a giant three-headed dog. So what do we do,"
7167,Harry?”
7168,"The light of adventure was kindling again in Ron’s eyes, but"
7169,Hermione answered before Harry could.
7170,“Go to Dumbledore. That’s what we should have done ages ago.
7171,If we try anything ourselves we’ll be thrown out for sure.”
7172,“But we’ve got no proof !” said Harry. “Quirrell’s too scared to
7173,back us up. Snape’s only got to say he doesn’t know how the troll
7174,got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third
7175,"floor — who do you think they’ll believe, him or us? It’s not exactly"
7176,"a secret we hate him, Dumbledore’ll think we made it up to get"
7177,"him sacked. Filch wouldn’t help us if his life depended on it, he’s"
7178,"too friendly with Snape, and the more students get thrown out, the"
7179,"better, he’ll think. And don’t forget, we’re not supposed to know"
7180,about the Stone or Fluffy. That’ll take a lot of explaining.”
7181,"Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn’t."
7182,“If we just do a bit of poking around —”
7183,"“No,” said Harry flatly, “we’ve done enough poking around.”"
7184,He pulled a map of Jupiter toward him and started to learn the
7185,names of its moons.
7186,"The following morning, notes were delivered to Harry, Hermione,"
7187,and Neville at the breakfast table. They were all the same:
7188,Your detention will take place at eleven o’clock tonight.
7189,Meet Mr. Filch in the entrance hall.
7190, 247   
7191,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7192,Harry had forgotten they still had detentions to do in the furor
7193,over the points they’d lost. He half expected Hermione to complain
7194,"that this was a whole night of studying lost, but she didn’t say a"
7195,"word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they’d got."
7196,"At eleven o’clock that night, they said good-bye to Ron in the"
7197,common room and went down to the entrance hall with Neville.
7198,Filch was already there — and so was Malfoy. Harry had also for-
7199,"gotten that Malfoy had gotten a detention, too."
7200,"“Follow me,” said Filch, lighting a lamp and leading them out-"
7201,side.
7202,"“I bet you’ll think twice about breaking a school rule again,"
7203,"won’t you, eh?” he said, leering at them. “Oh yes . . . hard work"
7204,and pain are the best teachers if you ask me. . . . It’s just a pity they
7205,let the old punishments die out . . . hang you by your wrists from
7206,"the ceiling for a few days, I’ve got the chains still in my office, keep"
7207,"’em well oiled in case they’re ever needed. . . . Right, off we go, and"
7208,"don’t think of running off, now, it’ll be worse for you if you do.”"
7209,They marched off across the dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing.
7210,Harry wondered what their punishment was going to be. It must
7211,"be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn’t be sounding so de-"
7212,lighted.
7213,"The moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throw-"
7214,"ing them into darkness. Ahead, Harry could see the lighted win-"
7215,dows of Hagrid’s hut. Then they heard a distant shout.
7216,"“Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”"
7217,Harry’s heart rose; if they were going to be working with Hagrid
7218,"it wouldn’t be so bad. His relief must have showed in his face, be-"
7219,"cause Filch said, “I suppose you think you’ll be enjoying yourself"
7220,  248  
7221,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7222,"with that oaf? Well, think again, boy — it’s into the forest you’re"
7223,going and I’m much mistaken if you’ll all come out in one piece.”
7224,"At this, Neville let out a little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in"
7225,his tracks.
7226,"“The forest?” he repeated, and he didn’t sound quite as cool as"
7227,usual. “We can’t go in there at night — there’s all sorts of things in
7228,"there — werewolves, I heard.”"
7229,Neville clutched the sleeve of Harry’s robe and made a choking
7230,noise.
7231,"“That’s your problem, isn’t it?” said Filch, his voice cracking"
7232,with glee. “Should’ve thought of them werewolves before you got
7233,"in trouble, shouldn’t you?”"
7234,"Hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark, Fang at his"
7235,"heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and a quiver of arrows"
7236,hung over his shoulder.
7237,"“Abou’ time,” he said. “I bin waitin’ fer half an hour already. All"
7238,"right, Harry, Hermione?”"
7239,"“I shouldn’t be too friendly to them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly,"
7240,"“they’re here to be punished, after all.”"
7241,"“That’s why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning at Filch. “Bin"
7242,"lecturin’ them, eh? ’Snot your place ter do that. Yeh’ve done yer bit,"
7243,I’ll take over from here.”
7244,"“I’ll be back at dawn,” said Filch, “for what’s left of them,” he"
7245,"added nastily, and he turned and started back toward the castle, his"
7246,lamp bobbing away in the darkness.
7247,Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.
7248,"“I’m not going in that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased to"
7249,hear the note of panic in his voice.
7250,  249 
7251,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7252,"“Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely."
7253,“Yeh’ve done wrong an’ now yeh’ve got ter pay fer it.”
7254,"“But this is servant stuff, it’s not for students to do. I thought"
7255,"we’d be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing"
7256,"this, he’d —”"
7257,"“— tell yer that’s how it is at Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled."
7258,“Copyin’ lines! What good’s that ter anyone? Yeh’ll do summat use-
7259,ful or yeh’ll get out. If yeh think yer father’d rather you were ex-
7260,"pelled, then get back off ter the castle an’ pack. Go on!”"
7261,"Malfoy didn’t move. He looked at Hagrid furiously, but then"
7262,dropped his gaze.
7263,"“Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, ’cause it’s dan-"
7264,"gerous what we’re gonna do tonight, an’ I don’ want no one takin’"
7265,risks. Follow me over here a moment.”
7266,He led them to the very edge of the forest. Holding his lamp up
7267,"high, he pointed down a narrow, winding earth track that disap-"
7268,peared into the thick black trees. A light breeze lifted their hair as
7269,they looked into the forest.
7270,"“Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin’ on the ground?"
7271,Silvery stuff? That’s unicorn blood. There’s a unicorn in there bin
7272,hurt badly by summat. This is the second time in a week. I found
7273,one dead last Wednesday. We’re gonna try an’ find the poor thing.
7274,We might have ter put it out of its misery.”
7275,“And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first?” said
7276,"Malfoy, unable to keep the fear out of his voice."
7277,“There’s nothin’ that lives in the forest that’ll hurt yeh if yer with
7278,"me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An’ keep ter the path. Right, now, we’re"
7279,gonna split inter two parties an’ follow the trail in diff ’rent direc-
7280,  250   
7281,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7282,"tions. There’s blood all over the place, it must’ve bin staggerin’"
7283,around since last night at least.”
7284,"“I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking at Fang’s long teeth."
7285,"“All right, but I warn yeh, he’s a coward,” said Hagrid. “So me,"
7286,"Harry, an’ Hermione’ll go one way an’ Draco, Neville, an’ Fang’ll"
7287,"go the other. Now, if any of us finds the unicorn, we’ll send up"
7288,"green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an’ practice now — that’s"
7289,"it — an’ if anyone gets in trouble, send up red sparks, an’ we’ll all"
7290,"come an’ find yeh — so, be careful — let’s go.”"
7291,The forest was black and silent. A little way into it they reached
7292,"a fork in the earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took"
7293,"the left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took the right."
7294,"They walked in silence, their eyes on the ground. Every now and"
7295,then a ray of moonlight through the branches above lit a spot of
7296,silver-blue blood on the fallen leaves.
7297,Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
7298,“Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?” Harry asked.
7299,"“Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It’s not easy ter catch a uni-"
7300,"corn, they’re powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be"
7301,hurt before.”
7302,They walked past a mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running
7303,water; there must be a stream somewhere close by. There were still
7304,spots of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path.
7305,"“You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don’ worry, it"
7306,"can’t’ve gone far if it’s this badly hurt, an’ then we’ll be able ter —"
7307,GET BEHIND THAT TREE!”
7308,Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off the
7309,path behind a towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it
7310, 251  
7311,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7312,"into his crossbow, raising it, ready to fire. The three of them lis-"
7313,tened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it
7314,sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground. Hagrid was squint-
7315,"ing up the dark path, but after a few seconds, the sound faded"
7316,away.
7317,"“I knew it,” he murmured. “There’s summat in here that"
7318,shouldn’ be.”
7319,“A werewolf?” Harry suggested.
7320,"“That wasn’ no werewolf an’ it wasn’ no unicorn, neither,” said"
7321,"Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”"
7322,"They walked more slowly, ears straining for the faintest sound."
7323,"Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, something definitely moved."
7324,“Who’s there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself — I’m armed!”
7325,"And into the clearing came — was it a man, or a horse? To the"
7326,"waist, a man, with red hair and beard, but below that was a horse’s"
7327,"gleaming chestnut body with a long, reddish tail. Harry and"
7328,Hermione’s jaws dropped.
7329,"“Oh, it’s you, Ronan,” said Hagrid in relief. “How are yeh?”"
7330,He walked forward and shook the centaur’s hand.
7331,"“Good evening to you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had a deep,"
7332,sorrowful voice. “Were you going to shoot me?”
7333,"“Can’t be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow."
7334,“There’s summat bad loose in this forest. This is Harry Potter an’
7335,"Hermione Granger, by the way. Students up at the school. An’ this"
7336,"is Ronan, you two. He’s a centaur.”"
7337,"“We’d noticed,” said Hermione faintly."
7338,"“Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you"
7339,"learn much, up at the school?”"
7340,  252 
7341,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7342,“Erm —”
7343,"“A bit,” said Hermione timidly."
7344,"“A bit. Well, that’s something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his"
7345,head and stared at the sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”
7346,"“Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I’m glad we’ve"
7347,"run inter yeh, Ronan, ’cause there’s a unicorn bin hurt — you seen"
7348,anythin’?”
7349,Ronan didn’t answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly up-
7350,"ward, then sighed again."
7351,"“Always the innocent are the first victims,” he said. “So it has"
7352,"been for ages past, so it is now.”"
7353,"“Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin’, Ronan? Any-"
7354,thin’ unusual?”
7355,"“Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched"
7356,him impatiently. “Unusually bright.”
7357,"“Yeah, but I was meanin’ anythin’ unusual a bit nearer home,”"
7358,said Hagrid. “So yeh haven’t noticed anythin’ strange?”
7359,"Yet again, Ronan took a while to answer. At last, he said, “The"
7360,forest hides many secrets.”
7361,A movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his
7362,"bow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and"
7363,-bodied and wilder-looking than Ronan.
7364,"“Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”"
7365,"“Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”"
7366,"“Well enough. Look, I’ve jus’ bin askin’ Ronan, you seen any-"
7367,thin’ odd in here lately? There’s a unicorn bin injured — would yeh
7368,know anythin’ about it?”
7369,Bane walked over to stand next to Ronan. He looked skyward.
7370,  253 
7371,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7372,"“Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply."
7373,"“We’ve heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either of you do"
7374,"see anythin’, let me know, won’t yeh? We’ll be off, then.”"
7375,"Harry and Hermione followed him out of the clearing, staring"
7376,over their shoulders at Ronan and Bane until the trees blocked
7377,their view.
7378,"“Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an’ get a straight answer out"
7379,of a centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested in anythin’ closer’n
7380,the moon.”
7381,“Are there many of them in here?” asked Hermione.
7382,"“Oh, a fair few. . . . Keep themselves to themselves mostly, but"
7383,they’re good enough about turnin’ up if ever I want a word. They’re
7384,"deep, mind, centaurs . . . they know things . . . jus’ don’ let on"
7385,much.”
7386,“D’you think that was a centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.
7387,"“Did that sound like hooves to you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was"
7388,what’s bin killin’ the unicorns — never heard anythin’ like it be-
7389,fore.”
7390,"They walked on through the dense, dark trees. Harry kept look-"
7391,ing nervously over his shoulder. He had the nasty feeling they were
7392,being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow
7393,with them. They had just passed a bend in the path when Her-
7394,mione grabbed Hagrid’s arm.
7395,"“Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, the others are in trouble!”"
7396,"“You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay on the path, I’ll"
7397,come back for yeh!”
7398,They heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and
7399,"stood looking at each other, very scared, until they couldn’t hear"
7400,anything but the rustling of leaves around them.
7401, 254   
7402,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7403,"“You don’t think they’ve been hurt, do you?” whispered"
7404,Hermione.
7405,"“I don’t care if Malfoy has, but if something’s got Neville . . . it’s"
7406,our fault he’s here in the first place.”
7407,The minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual.
7408,"Harry’s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every"
7409,cracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others?
7410,"At last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid’s return. Mal-"
7411,"foy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy,"
7412,"it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a"
7413,joke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks.
7414,"“We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two"
7415,"were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay"
7416,"with me an’ Hermione, Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot. I’m"
7417,"sorry,” Hagrid added in a whisper to Harry, “but he’ll have a harder"
7418,"time frightenin’ you, an’ we’ve gotta get this done.”"
7419,So Harry set off into the heart of the forest with Malfoy and
7420,"Fang. They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into"
7421,"the forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow be-"
7422,cause the trees were so thick. Harry thought the blood seemed to
7423,"be getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as"
7424,though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close
7425,"by. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches"
7426,of an ancient oak.
7427,"“Look —” he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy."
7428,Something bright white was gleaming on the ground. They
7429,inched closer.
7430,"It was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never"
7431,"seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck"
7432,  255   
7433,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7434,out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread
7435,pearly-white on the dark leaves.
7436,Harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound
7437,made him freeze where he stood. A bush on the edge of the clear-
7438,"ing quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came"
7439,"crawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy,"
7440,"and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn,"
7441,"lowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to"
7442,drink its blood.
7443,“AAAAAAAAAAARGH!”
7444,Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted — so did Fang. The
7445,hooded figure raised its head and looked right at Harry — unicorn
7446,blood was dribbling down its front. It got to its feet and came
7447,swiftly toward Harry — he couldn’t move for fear.
7448,Then a pain like he’d never felt before pierced his head; it was as
7449,"though his scar were on fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward."
7450,"He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped"
7451,"clean over Harry, charging at the figure."
7452,The pain in Harry’s head was so bad he fell to his knees. It took
7453,"a minute or two to pass. When he looked up, the figure had"
7454,"gone. A centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this"
7455,one looked younger; he had white-blond hair and a palomino
7456,body.
7457,"“Are you all right?” said the centaur, pulling Harry to his feet."
7458,“Yes — thank you — what was that?”
7459,"The centaur didn’t answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like"
7460,"pale sapphires. He looked carefully at Harry, his eyes lingering on"
7461,"the scar that stood out, livid, on Harry’s forehead."
7462, 256 
7463,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7464,"“You are the Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back to"
7465,Hagrid. The forest is not safe at this time — especially for you.
7466,Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.
7467,"“My name is Firenze,” he added, as he lowered himself on to his"
7468,front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
7469,There was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other
7470,side of the clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through the
7471,"trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty."
7472,“Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have a hu-
7473,man on your back! Have you no shame? Are you a common mule?”
7474,“Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is the Potter
7475,"boy. The quicker he leaves this forest, the better.”"
7476,"“What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember,"
7477,"Firenze, we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens. Have"
7478,we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets?”
7479,Ronan pawed the ground nervously. “I’m sure Firenze thought he
7480,"was acting for the best,” he said in his gloomy voice."
7481,Bane kicked his back legs in anger.
7482,“For the best! What is that to do with us? Centaurs are con-
7483,cerned with what has been foretold! It is not our business to run
7484,around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!”
7485,"Firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger, so that"
7486,Harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on.
7487,“Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed at Bane. “Do
7488,you not understand why it was killed? Or have the planets not let
7489,you in on that secret? I set myself against what is lurking in this for-
7490,"est, Bane, yes, with humans alongside me if I must.”"
7491,And Firenze whisked around; with Harry clutching on as best he
7492, 257   
7493,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7494,"could, they plunged off into the trees, leaving Ronan and Bane be-"
7495,hind them.
7496,Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on.
7497,“Why’s Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you
7498,"saved me from, anyway?”"
7499,"Firenze slowed to a walk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed"
7500,"in case of low-hanging branches, but did not answer Harry’s ques-"
7501,tion. They made their way through the trees in silence for so long
7502,that Harry thought Firenze didn’t want to talk to him anymore.
7503,"They were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees, how-"
7504,"ever, when Firenze suddenly stopped."
7505,"“Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”"
7506,"“No,” said Harry, startled by the odd question. “We’ve only used"
7507,the horn and tail hair in Potions.”
7508,"“That is because it is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn,” said"
7509,"Firenze. “Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to"
7510,"gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep"
7511,"you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price."
7512,"You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and"
7513,"you will have but a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the"
7514,blood touches your lips.”
7515,"Harry stared at the back of Firenze’s head, which was dappled"
7516,silver in the moonlight.
7517,“But who’d be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you’re go-
7518,"ing to be cursed forever, death’s better, isn’t it?”"
7519,"“It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is to stay alive long"
7520,enough to drink something else — something that will bring you
7521,back to full strength and power — something that will mean you
7522,  258   
7523,THE FORBIDDEN FOREST
7524,"can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden in the"
7525,school at this very moment?”
7526,“The Sorcerer’s Stone! Of course — the Elixir of Life! But I don’t
7527,understand who —”
7528,“Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return
7529,"to power, who has clung to life, awaiting their chance?”"
7530,It was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around
7531,"Harry’s heart. Over the rustling of the trees, he seemed to hear once"
7532,more what Hagrid had told him on the night they had met: “Some
7533,"say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough"
7534,human left in him to die.”
7535,"“Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol —”"
7536,"“Harry! Harry, are you all right?”"
7537,"Hermione was running toward them down the path, Hagrid"
7538,puffing along behind her.
7539,"“I’m fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The"
7540,"unicorns dead, Hagrid, it’s in that clearing back there.”"
7541,"“This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured as Hagrid hur-"
7542,ried off to examine the unicorn. “You are safe now.”
7543,Harry slid off his back.
7544,"“Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been"
7545,"read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of"
7546,those times.”
7547,"He turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest, leav-"
7548,ing Harry shivering behind him.
7549,"Ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room, waiting for them"
7550,to return. He shouted something about Quidditch fouls when
7551,  259  
7552,CHAPTER FIFTEEN
7553,"Harry roughly shook him awake. In a matter of seconds, though,"
7554,he was wide-eyed as Harry began to tell him and Hermione what
7555,had happened in the forest.
7556,Harry couldn’t sit down. He paced up and down in front of the
7557,fire. He was still shaking.
7558,“Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort . . . and Voldemort’s wait-
7559,ing in the forest . . . and all this time we thought Snape just wanted
7560,to get rich. . . .”
7561,"“Stop saying the name!” said Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he"
7562,thought Voldemort could hear them.
7563,Harry wasn’t listening.
7564,"“Firenze saved me, but he shouldn’t have done so. . . . Bane was"
7565,furious . . . he was talking about interfering with what the planets
7566,say is going to happen. . . . They must show that Voldemort’s com-
7567,ing back. . . . Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill
7568,me. . . . I suppose that’s written in the stars as well.”
7569,“Will you stop saying the name!” Ron hissed.
7570,"“So all I’ve got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone,”"
7571,"Harry went on feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able to come"
7572,"and finish me off. . . . Well, I suppose Bane’ll be happy.”"
7573,"Hermione looked very frightened, but she had a word of com-"
7574,fort.
7575,"“Harry, everyone says Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-"
7576,"Who was ever afraid of. With Dumbledore around, You-Know-"
7577,"Who won’t touch you. Anyway, who says the centaurs are right? It"
7578,"sounds like fortune-telling to me, and Professor McGonagall says"
7579,that’s a very imprecise branch of magic.”
7580,The sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went

7583,"to bed exhausted, their throats sore. But the night’s surprises"
7584,weren’t over.
7585,"When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility"
7586,Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was a note pinned
7587,to it:
7588,Just in case.

7592,THE TRAPDOOR
7593,"I     n years to come, Harry would never quite remember how he"
7594,had managed to get through his exams when he half expected
7595,Voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment. Yet
7596,"the days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still"
7597,alive and well behind the locked door.
7598,"It was sweltering hot, especially in the large classroom where"
7599,"they did their written papers. They had been given special, new"
7600,"quills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-"
7601,Cheating spell.
7602,They had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them
7603,one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tap-
7604,dance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a
7605,mouse into a snuffbox — points were given for how pretty the
7606,"snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them"
7607,"all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried to remem-"
7608,ber how to make a Forgetfulness potion.
7609,  262  
7610,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7611,"Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains"
7612,"in his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip"
7613,into the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam
7614,"nerves because Harry couldn’t sleep, but the truth was that Harry"
7615,"kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now"
7616,worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood
7617,in it.
7618,Maybe it was because they hadn’t seen what Harry had seen in
7619,"the forest, or because they didn’t have scars burning on their fore-"
7620,"heads, but Ron and Hermione didn’t seem as worried about the"
7621,"Stone as Harry. The idea of Voldemort certainly scared them, but"
7622,"he didn’t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with"
7623,their studying they didn’t have much time to fret about what Snape
7624,or anyone else might be up to.
7625,Their very last exam was History of Magic. One hour of an-
7626,swering questions about batty old wizards who’d invented self-
7627,"stirring cauldrons and they’d be free, free for a whole wonderful"
7628,week until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Profes-
7629,sor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their
7630,"parchment, Harry couldn’t help cheering with the rest."
7631,"“That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione"
7632,as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. “I
7633,needn’t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or
7634,the uprising of Elfric the Eager.”
7635,Hermione always liked to go through their exam papers after-
7636,"ward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down"
7637,to the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee
7638,"Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was bask-"
7639,ing in the warm shallows.
7640, 263  
7641,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
7642,"“No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out on the"
7643,"grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we’ve got a week be-"
7644,"fore we find out how badly we’ve done, there’s no need to worry"
7645,yet.”
7646,Harry was rubbing his forehead.
7647,“I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar
7648,"keeps hurting — it’s happened before, but never as often as this.”"
7649,"“Go to Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested."
7650,"“I’m not ill,” said Harry. “I think it’s a warning . . . it means"
7651,danger’s coming. . . .”
7652,"Ron couldn’t get worked up, it was too hot."
7653,"“Harry, relax, Hermione’s right, the Stone’s safe as long as Dum-"
7654,"bledore’s around. Anyway, we’ve never had any proof Snape found"
7655,"out how to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once,"
7656,he’s not going to try it again in a hurry. And Neville will play Quid-
7657,ditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”
7658,"Harry nodded, but he couldn’t shake off a lurking feeling that"
7659,"there was something he’d forgotten to do, something important."
7660,"When he tried to explain this, Hermione said, “That’s just the ex-"
7661,ams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfigu-
7662,ration notes before I remembered we’d done that one.”
7663,Harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling didn’t have anything
7664,"to do with work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward the"
7665,"school across the bright blue sky, a note clamped in its mouth. Ha-"
7666,grid was the only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would
7667,never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how to
7668,get past Fluffy . . . never . . . but —
7669,Harry suddenly jumped to his feet.
7670, 264 
7671,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7672,“Where’re you going?” said Ron sleepily.
7673,"“I’ve just thought of something,” said Harry. He had turned"
7674,"white. “We’ve got to go and see Hagrid, now.”"
7675,"“Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying to keep up."
7676,"“Don’t you think it’s a bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up the"
7677,"grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a"
7678,"dragon, and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in"
7679,his pocket? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if
7680,"it’s against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don’t you think?"
7681,Why didn’t I see it before?”
7682,"“What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting"
7683,"across the grounds toward the forest, didn’t answer."
7684,Hagrid was sitting in an armchair outside his house; his trousers
7685,"and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas into a large"
7686,bowl.
7687,"“Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer a"
7688,drink?”
7689,"“Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off."
7690,"“No, we’re in a hurry. Hagrid, I’ve got to ask you something. You"
7691,know that night you won Norbert? What did the stranger you were
7692,playing cards with look like?”
7693,"“Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn’ take his cloak off.”"
7694,He saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eye-
7695,brows.
7696,"“It’s not that unusual, yeh get a lot o’ funny folk in the Hog’s"
7697,Head — that’s one o’ the pubs down in the village. Mighta bin a
7698,"dragon dealer, mightn’ he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”"
7699,Harry sank down next to the bowl of peas.
7700, 265   
7701,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
7702,"“What did you talk to him about, Hagrid? Did you mention"
7703,Hogwarts at all?”
7704,"“Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning as he tried to remem-"
7705,"ber. “Yeah . . . he asked what I did, an’ I told him I was gamekeeper"
7706,here. . . . He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I look after . . .
7707,so I told him . . . an’ I said what I’d always really wanted was a
7708,"dragon . . . an’ then . . . I can’ remember too well, ’cause he kept"
7709,"buyin’ me drinks. . . . Let’s see . . . yeah, then he said he had the"
7710,dragon egg an’ we could play cards fer it if I wanted . . . but he had
7711,"ter be sure I could handle it, he didn’ want it ter go ter any old"
7712,"home. . . . So I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy. . . .”"
7713,"“And did he — did he seem interested in Fluffy?” Harry asked,"
7714,trying to keep his voice calm.
7715,"“Well — yeah — how many three-headed dogs d’yeh meet,"
7716,"even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy’s a piece o’ cake if yeh"
7717,"know how to calm him down, jus’ play him a bit o’ music an’ he’ll"
7718,go straight off ter sleep —”
7719,Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
7720,“I shouldn’ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it!
7721,Hey — where’re yeh goin’?”
7722,"Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn’t speak to each other at all un-"
7723,"til they came to a halt in the entrance hall, which seemed very cold"
7724,and gloomy after the grounds.
7725,"“We’ve got to go to Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that"
7726,"stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Volde-"
7727,"mort under that cloak — it must’ve been easy, once he’d got Ha-"
7728,grid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might
7729,back us up if Bane doesn’t stop him. Where’s Dumbledore’s office?”
7730, 266   
7731,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7732,"They looked around, as if hoping to see a sign pointing them in"
7733,the right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore
7734,"lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him."
7735,"“We’ll just have to —” Harry began, but a voice suddenly rang"
7736,across the hall.
7737,“What are you three doing inside?”
7738,"It was Professor McGonagall, carrying a large pile of books."
7739,"“We want to see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather"
7740,"bravely, Harry and Ron thought."
7741,"“See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, as"
7742,though this was a very fishy thing to want to do. “Why?”
7743,Harry swallowed — now what?
7744,"“It’s sort of secret,” he said, but he wished at once he hadn’t, be-"
7745,cause Professor McGonagall’s nostrils flared.
7746,"“Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly."
7747,“He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew
7748,off for London at once.”
7749,“He’s gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”
7750,"“Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard, Potter, he has"
7751,many demands on his time —”
7752,“But this is important.”
7753,“Something you have to say is more important than the Min-
7754,"istry of Magic, Potter?”"
7755,"“Look,” said Harry, throwing caution to the winds, “Pro-"
7756,fessor — it’s about the Sorcerer’s Stone —”
7757,"Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn’t that."
7758,"The books she was carrying tumbled out of her arms, but she didn’t"
7759,pick them up.
7760, 267  
7761,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
7762,“How do you know — ?” she spluttered.
7763,"“Professor, I think — I know — that Sn— that someone’s going"
7764,to try and steal the Stone. I’ve got to talk to Professor Dumble-
7765,dore.”
7766,She eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion.
7767,"“Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally."
7768,"“I don’t know how you found out about the Stone, but rest assured,"
7769,"no one can possibly steal it, it’s too well protected.”"
7770,“But Professor —”
7771,"“Potter, I know what I’m talking about,” she said shortly. She"
7772,bent down and gathered up the fallen books. “I suggest you all go
7773,back outside and enjoy the sunshine.”
7774,But they didn’t.
7775,"“It’s tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGona-"
7776,gall was out of earshot. “Snape’s going through the trapdoor
7777,"tonight. He’s found out everything he needs, and now he’s got"
7778,"Dumbledore out of the way. He sent that note, I bet the Ministry"
7779,of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up.”
7780,“But what can we —”
7781,Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.
7782,Snape was standing there.
7783,"“Good afternoon,” he said smoothly."
7784,They stared at him.
7785,"“You shouldn’t be inside on a day like this,” he said, with an odd,"
7786,twisted smile.
7787,"“We were —” Harry began, without any idea what he was going"
7788,to say.
7789,"“You want to be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around"
7790,  268  
7791,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7792,"like this, people will think you’re up to something. And Gryffindor"
7793,"really can’t afford to lose any more points, can it?”"
7794,"Harry flushed. They turned to go outside, but Snape called them"
7795,back.
7796,"“Be warned, Potter — any more nighttime wanderings and I will"
7797,personally make sure you are expelled. Good day to you.”
7798,He strode off in the direction of the staffroom.
7799,"Out on the stone steps, Harry turned to the others."
7800,"“Right, here’s what we’ve got to do,” he whispered urgently. “One"
7801,of us has got to keep an eye on Snape — wait outside the staffroom
7802,"and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you’d better do that.”"
7803,“Why me?”
7804,"“It’s obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend to be waiting for"
7805,"Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put on a high voice, “ ‘Oh Profes-"
7806,"sor Flitwick, I’m so worried, I think I got question fourteen b"
7807,wrong. . . .’ ”
7808,"“Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed to go and watch"
7809,out for Snape.
7810,"“And we’d better stay outside the third-floor corridor,” Harry"
7811,told Ron. “Come on.”
7812,But that part of the plan didn’t work. No sooner had they
7813,reached the door separating Fluffy from the rest of the school than
7814,"Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her"
7815,temper.
7816,“I suppose you think you’re harder to get past than a pack of en-
7817,chantments!” she stormed. “Enough of this nonsense! If I hear
7818,"you’ve come anywhere near here again, I’ll take another fifty points"
7819,"from Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, from my own House!”"
7820, 269 
7821,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
7822,Harry and Ron went back to the common room. Harry had just
7823,"said, “At least Hermione’s on Snape’s tail,” when the portrait of the"
7824,Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
7825,"“I’m sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me"
7826,"what I was doing, so I said I was waiting for Flitwick, and Snape"
7827,"went to get him, and I’ve only just got away, I don’t know where"
7828,Snape went.”
7829,"“Well, that’s it then, isn’t it?” Harry said."
7830,The other two stared at him. He was pale and his eyes were glit-
7831,tering.
7832,“I’m going out of here tonight and I’m going to try and get to
7833,the Stone first.”
7834,“You’re mad!” said Ron.
7835,“You can’t!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape
7836,have said? You’ll be expelled!”
7837,“SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don’t you understand? If Snape
7838,"gets hold of the Stone, Voldemort’s coming back! Haven’t you"
7839,heard what it was like when he was trying to take over? There won’t
7840,"be any Hogwarts to get expelled from! He’ll flatten it, or turn it"
7841,into a school for the Dark Arts! Losing points doesn’t matter any-
7842,"more, can’t you see? D’you think he’ll leave you and your families"
7843,alone if Gryffindor wins the House Cup? If I get caught before I
7844,"can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and"
7845,"wait for Voldemort to find me there, it’s only dying a bit later than"
7846,"I would have, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side! I’m"
7847,going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is
7848,"going to stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”"
7849,He glared at them.
7850, 270  
7851,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7852,"“You’re right, Harry,” said Hermione in a small voice."
7853,"“I’ll use the Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lucky I got"
7854,it back.”
7855,“But will it cover all three of us?” said Ron.
7856,“All — all three of us?”
7857,"“Oh, come off it, you don’t think we’d let you go alone?”"
7858,"“Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think"
7859,you’d get to the Stone without us? I’d better go and look through
7860,"my books, there might be something useful. . . .”"
7861,"“But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”"
7862,"“Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me"
7863,in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam.
7864,They’re not throwing me out after that.”
7865,After dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common
7866,room. Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryffindors had any-
7867,"thing to say to Harry any more, after all. This was the first night he"
7868,hadn’t been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her
7869,"notes, hoping to come across one of the enchantments they were"
7870,about to try to break. Harry and Ron didn’t talk much. Both of
7871,them were thinking about what they were about to do.
7872,"Slowly, the room emptied as people drifted off to bed."
7873,"“Better get the cloak,” Ron muttered, as Lee Jordan finally left,"
7874,stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark dormi-
7875,tory. He pulled out the cloak and then his eyes fell on the flute Ha-
7876,grid had given him for Christmas. He pocketed it to use on
7877,Fluffy — he didn’t feel much like singing.
7878,He ran back down to the common room.
7879, 271   
7880,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
7881,"“We’d better put the cloak on here, and make sure it covers all"
7882,three of us — if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its
7883,own —”
7884,“What are you doing?” said a voice from the corner of the room.
7885,"Neville appeared from behind an armchair, clutching Trevor the"
7886,"toad, who looked as though he’d been making another bid for free-"
7887,dom.
7888,"“Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting the"
7889,cloak behind his back.
7890,Neville stared at their guilty faces.
7891,"“You’re going out again,” he said."
7892,"“No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we’re not. Why don’t you go"
7893,"to bed, Neville?”"
7894,Harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door. They
7895,"couldn’t afford to waste any more time, Snape might even now be"
7896,playing Fluffy to sleep.
7897,"“You can’t go out,” said Neville, “you’ll be caught again."
7898,Gryffindor will be in even more trouble.”
7899,"“You don’t understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”"
7900,But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desper-
7901,ate.
7902,"“I won’t let you do it,” he said, hurrying to stand in front of the"
7903,portrait hole. “I’ll — I’ll fight you!”
7904,"“Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away from that hole and don’t be"
7905,an idiot —”
7906,“Don’t you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don’t think you
7907,should be breaking any more rules! And you were the one who told
7908,me to stand up to people!”
7909, 272   
7910,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7911,"“Yes, but not to us,” said Ron in exasperation. “Neville, you"
7912,don’t know what you’re doing.”
7913,"He took a step forward and Neville dropped Trevor the toad,"
7914,who leapt out of sight.
7915,"“Go on then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I’m"
7916,ready!”
7917,Harry turned to Hermione.
7918,"“Do something,” he said desperately."
7919,Hermione stepped forward.
7920,"“Neville,” she said, “I’m really, really sorry about this.”"
7921,She raised her wand.
7922,"“Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it at Neville."
7923,Neville’s arms snapped to his sides. His legs sprang together. His
7924,"whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on"
7925,"his face, stiff as a board."
7926,Hermione ran to turn him over. Neville’s jaws were jammed to-
7927,"gether so he couldn’t speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking at"
7928,them in horror.
7929,“What’ve you done to him?” Harry whispered.
7930,"“It’s the full Body-Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh,"
7931,"Neville, I’m so sorry.”"
7932,"“We had to, Neville, no time to explain,” said Harry."
7933,"“You’ll understand later, Neville,” said Ron as they stepped over"
7934,him and pulled on the Invisibility Cloak.
7935,But leaving Neville lying motionless on the floor didn’t feel like
7936,"a very good omen. In their nervous state, every statue’s shadow"
7937,"looked like Filch, every distant breath of wind sounded like Peeves"
7938,swooping down on them.

7940,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
7941,"At the foot of the first set of stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris"
7942,skulking near the top.
7943,"“Oh, let’s kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered in Harry’s ear,"
7944,"but Harry shook his head. As they climbed carefully around her,"
7945,"Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes on them, but didn’t do any-"
7946,thing.
7947,They didn’t meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up
7948,"to the third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening the"
7949,carpet so that people would trip.
7950,“Who’s there?” he said suddenly as they climbed toward him. He
7951,"narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you’re there, even if I can’t"
7952,see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”
7953,"He rose up in the air and floated there, squinting at them."
7954,"“Should call Filch, I should, if something’s a-creeping around"
7955,unseen.”
7956,Harry had a sudden idea.
7957,"“Peeves,” he said, in a hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his"
7958,own reasons for being invisible.”
7959,Peeves almost fell out of the air in shock. He caught himself in
7960,time and hovered about a foot off the stairs.
7961,"“So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, sir,” he said greasily. “My"
7962,"mistake, my mistake — I didn’t see you — of course I didn’t,"
7963,"you’re invisible — forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”"
7964,"“I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away from"
7965,this place tonight.”
7966,"“I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up in the air"
7967,"again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I’ll not bother you.”"
7968,And he scooted off.

7970,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
7971,"“Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron."
7972,"A few seconds later, they were there, outside the third-floor cor-"
7973,ridor — and the door was already ajar.
7974,"“Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape’s already got"
7975,past Fluffy.”
7976,Seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three
7977,"of them what was facing them. Underneath the cloak, Harry"
7978,turned to the other two.
7979,"“If you want to go back, I won’t blame you,” he said. “You can"
7980,"take the cloak, I won’t need it now.”"
7981,"“Don’t be stupid,” said Ron."
7982,"“We’re coming,” said Hermione."
7983,Harry pushed the door open.
7984,"As the door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All"
7985,"three of the dog’s noses sniffed madly in their direction, even"
7986,though it couldn’t see them.
7987,“What’s that at its feet?” Hermione whispered.
7988,"“Looks like a harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”"
7989,"“It must wake up the moment you stop playing,” said Harry."
7990,"“Well, here goes . . .”"
7991,"He put Hagrid’s flute to his lips and blew. It wasn’t really a tune,"
7992,but from the first note the beast’s eyes began to droop. Harry
7993,"hardly drew breath. Slowly, the dog’s growls ceased — it tottered"
7994,"on its paws and fell to its knees, then it slumped to the ground, fast"
7995,asleep.
7996,"“Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry as they slipped out of the"
7997,"cloak and crept toward the trapdoor. They could feel the dog’s hot,"
7998,smelly breath as they approached the giant heads.
7999, 275   
8000,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
8001,"“I think we’ll be able to pull the door open,” said Ron, peering"
8002,"over the dog’s back. “Want to go first, Hermione?”"
8003,"“No, I don’t!”"
8004,“All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the
8005,"dog’s legs. He bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor, which"
8006,swung up and open.
8007,“What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
8008,"“Nothing — just black — there’s no way of climbing down,"
8009,we’ll just have to drop.”
8010,"Harry, who was still playing the flute, waved at Ron to get his at-"
8011,tention and pointed at himself.
8012,“You want to go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don’t know
8013,how deep this thing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so she can
8014,keep him asleep.”
8015,"Harry handed the flute over. In the few seconds’ silence, the dog"
8016,"growled and twitched, but the moment Hermione began to play, it"
8017,fell back into its deep sleep.
8018,Harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor.
8019,There was no sign of the bottom.
8020,He lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by
8021,"his fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron and said, “If anything"
8022,"happens to me, don’t follow. Go straight to the owlery and send"
8023,"Hedwig to Dumbledore, right?”"
8024,"“Right,” said Ron."
8025,"“See you in a minute, I hope. . . .”"
8026,"And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him as he fell"
8027,"down, down, down and —"
8028,"FLUMP. With a funny, muffled sort of thump he landed on"
8029, 276    
8030,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
8031,"something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used to the"
8032,gloom. It felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant.
8033,"“It’s okay!” he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp,"
8034,"which was the open trapdoor, “it’s a soft landing, you can jump!”"
8035,"Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next to Harry."
8036,“What’s this stuff?” were his first words.
8037,"“Dunno, some sort of plant thing. I suppose it’s here to break"
8038,"the fall. Come on, Hermione!”"
8039,"The distant music stopped. There was a loud bark from the dog,"
8040,but Hermione had already jumped. She landed on Harry’s other
8041,side.
8042,"“We must be miles under the school,” she said."
8043,"“Lucky this plant thing’s here, really,” said Ron."
8044,“Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look at you both!”
8045,She leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall. She had to
8046,"struggle because the moment she had landed, the plant had started"
8047,to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. As for Harry and
8048,"Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers"
8049,without their noticing.
8050,Hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a
8051,firm grip on her. Now she watched in horror as the two boys fought
8052,"to pull the plant off them, but the more they strained against it, the"
8053,tighter and faster the plant wound around them.
8054,“Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this
8055,is — it’s Devil’s Snare!”
8056,"“Oh, I’m so glad we know what it’s called, that’s a great help,”"
8057,"snarled Ron, leaning back, trying to stop the plant from curling"
8058,around his neck.
8059, 277   
8060,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
8061,"“Shut up, I’m trying to remember how to kill it!” said Her-"
8062,mione.
8063,"“Well, hurry up, I can’t breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling with it"
8064,as it curled around his chest.
8065,"“Devil’s Snare, Devil’s Snare . . . what did Professor Sprout"
8066,say? — it likes the dark and the damp —”
8067,“So light a fire!” Harry choked.
8068,"“Yes — of course — but there’s no wood!” Hermione cried,"
8069,wringing her hands.
8070,“HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU A
8071,WITCH OR NOT?”
8072,"“Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand,"
8073,"waved it, muttered something, and sent a jet of the same bluebell"
8074,"flames she had used on Snape at the plant. In a matter of seconds,"
8075,the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the
8076,"light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from"
8077,"their bodies, and they were able to pull free."
8078,"“Lucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry"
8079,"as he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face."
8080,"“Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn’t lose his head in a cri-"
8081,"sis — ‘there’s no wood,’ honestly.”"
8082,"“This way,” said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which"
8083,was the only way forward.
8084,All they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip
8085,of water trickling down the walls. The passageway sloped down-
8086,"ward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant"
8087,"jolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding"
8088,"vaults in the wizards’ bank. If they met a dragon, a fully-grown"
8089,dragon — Norbert had been bad enough . . .
8090, 278  
8091,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
8092,“Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.
8093,Harry listened. A soft rustling and clinking seemed to be com-
8094,ing from up ahead.
8095,“Do you think it’s a ghost?”
8096,“I don’t know . . . sounds like wings to me.”
8097,“There’s light ahead — I can see something moving.”
8098,They reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a
8099,"brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was"
8100,"full of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around"
8101,the room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy
8102,wooden door.
8103,“Do you think they’ll attack us if we cross the room?” said Ron.
8104,"“Probably,” said Harry. “They don’t look very vicious, but I sup-"
8105,"pose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there’s no other"
8106,choice . . . I’ll run.”
8107,"He took a deep breath, covered his face with his arms, and"
8108,sprinted across the room. He expected to feel sharp beaks and claws
8109,"tearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the"
8110,"door untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked."
8111,The other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the
8112,"door, but it wouldn’t budge, not even when Hermione tried her"
8113,Alohomora Charm.
8114,“Now what?” said Ron.
8115,"“These birds . . . they can’t be here just for decoration,” said"
8116,Hermione.
8117,"They watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering — glitter-"
8118,ing?
8119,“They’re not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They’re keys! Winged
8120,keys — look carefully. So that must mean . . .” he looked around
8121, 279   
8122,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
8123,the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys.
8124,“. . . yes — look! Broomsticks! We’ve got to catch the key to the
8125,door!”
8126,“But there are hundreds of them!”
8127,Ron examined the lock on the door.
8128,"“We’re looking for a big, old-fashioned one — probably silver,"
8129,like the handle.”
8130,"They each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air, soar-"
8131,"ing into the midst of the cloud of keys. They grabbed and snatched,"
8132,but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost
8133,impossible to catch one.
8134,"Not for nothing, though, was Harry the youngest Seeker in a"
8135,century. He had a knack for spotting things other people didn’t. Af-
8136,"ter a minute’s weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers,"
8137,"he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing, as if it had al-"
8138,ready been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole.
8139,“That one!” he called to the others. “That big one — there —
8140,"no, there — with bright blue wings — the feathers are all crum-"
8141,pled on one side.”
8142,"Ron went speeding in the direction that Harry was pointing,"
8143,"crashed into the ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom."
8144,"“We’ve got to close in on it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off"
8145,"the key with the damaged wing. “Ron, you come at it from"
8146,"above — Hermione, stay below and stop it from going down —"
8147,"and I’ll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”"
8148,"Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key dodged them"
8149,"both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward the wall, Harry"
8150,"leaned forward and with a nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against"
8151,  280 
8152,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
8153,the stone with one hand. Ron and Hermione’s cheers echoed
8154,around the high chamber.
8155,"They landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key strug-"
8156,gling in his hand. He rammed it into the lock and turned — it
8157,"worked. The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took"
8158,"flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught"
8159,twice.
8160,"“Ready?” Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door han-"
8161,dle. They nodded. He pulled the door open.
8162,The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all.
8163,"But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to re-"
8164,veal an astonishing sight.
8165,"They were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind"
8166,"the black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved"
8167,"from what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the"
8168,"chamber, were the white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shiv-"
8169,ered slightly — the towering white chessmen had no faces.
8170,“Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.
8171,"“It’s obvious, isn’t it?” said Ron. “We’ve got to play our way"
8172,across the room.”
8173,Behind the white pieces they could see another door.
8174,“How?” said Hermione nervously.
8175,"“I think,” said Ron, “we’re going to have to be chessmen.”"
8176,He walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch
8177,"the knights horse. At once, the stone sprang to life. The horse pawed"
8178,the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down
8179,at Ron.
8180,“Do we — er — have to join you to get across?”
8181, 281  
8182,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
8183,The black knight nodded. Ron turned to the other two.
8184,“This needs thinking about. . . .” he said. “I suppose we’ve got
8185,to take the place of three of the black pieces. . . .”
8186,"Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally"
8187,"he said, “Now, don’t be offended or anything, but neither of you are"
8188,that good at chess —”
8189,"“We’re not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what"
8190,to do.”
8191,"“Well, Harry, you take the place of that bishop, and Hermione,"
8192,you go there instead of that castle.”
8193,“What about you?”
8194,"“I’m going to be a knight,” said Ron."
8195,"The chessmen seemed to have been listening, because at these"
8196,"words a knight, a bishop, and a castle turned their backs on the"
8197,"white pieces and walked off the board, leaving three empty squares"
8198,"that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took."
8199,"“White always plays first in chess,” said Ron, peering across the"
8200,board. “Yes . . . look . . .”
8201,A white pawn had moved forward two squares.
8202,Ron started to direct the black pieces. They moved silently
8203,wherever he sent them. Harry’s knees were trembling. What if they
8204,lost?
8205,“Harry — move diagonally four squares to the right.”
8206,Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken.
8207,The white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the
8208,"board, where he lay quite still, facedown."
8209,"“Had to let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you"
8210,"free to take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”"
8211,  282  
8212,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
8213,"Every time one of their men was lost, the white pieces showed"
8214,no mercy. Soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped
8215,"along the wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed in time that Harry"
8216,and Hermione were in danger. He himself darted around the
8217,"board, taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black"
8218,ones.
8219,"“We’re nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think —"
8220,let me think . . .”
8221,The white queen turned her blank face toward him.
8222,"“Yes . . .” said Ron softly, “it’s the only way . . . I’ve got to be"
8223,taken.”
8224,“NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.
8225,“That’s chess!” snapped Ron. “You’ve got to make some sacri-
8226,fices! I make my move and she’ll take me — that leaves you free
8227,"to checkmate the king, Harry!”"
8228,“But —”
8229,“Do you want to stop Snape or not?”
8230,“Ron —”
8231,"“Look, if you don’t hurry up, he’ll already have the Stone!”"
8232,There was no alternative.
8233,"“Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I"
8234,"go — now, don’t hang around once you’ve won.”"
8235,"He stepped forward, and the white queen pounced. She struck"
8236,"Ron hard across the head with her stone arm, and he crashed to the"
8237,floor — Hermione screamed but stayed on her square — the white
8238,queen dragged Ron to one side. He looked as if he’d been knocked
8239,out.
8240,"Shaking, Harry moved three spaces to the left."
8241, 283    
8242,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
8243,The white king took off his crown and threw it at Harry’s feet.
8244,"They had won. The chessmen parted and bowed, leaving the door"
8245,"ahead clear. With one last desperate look back at Ron, Harry and"
8246,Hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway.
8247,“What if he’s — ?”
8248,"“He’ll be all right,” said Harry, trying to convince himself."
8249,“What do you reckon’s next?”
8250,"“We’ve had Sprout’s, that was the Devil’s Snare; Flitwick must’ve"
8251,put charms on the keys; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to
8252,"make them alive; that leaves Quirrell’s spell, and Snape’s . . .”"
8253,They had reached another door.
8254,“All right?” Harry whispered.
8255,“Go on.”
8256,Harry pushed it open.
8257,"A disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both of them pull"
8258,"their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat on the"
8259,"floor in front of them, a troll even larger than the one they had"
8260,"tackled, out cold with a bloody lump on its head."
8261,"“I’m glad we didn’t have to fight that one,” Harry whispered as"
8262,"they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs. “Come on, I"
8263,can’t breathe.”
8264,"He pulled open the next door, both of them hardly daring to"
8265,look at what came next — but there was nothing very frightening
8266,"in here, just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing"
8267,on it in a line.
8268,"“Snape’s,” said Harry. “What do we have to do?”"
8269,"They stepped over the threshold, and immediately a fire sprang"
8270,up behind them in the doorway. It wasn’t ordinary fire either; it was
8271, 284   
8272,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
8273,"purple. At the same instant, black flames shot up in the doorway"
8274,leading onward. They were trapped.
8275,“Look!” Hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles.
8276,Harry looked over her shoulder to read it:
8277,"Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,"
8278,"Two of us will help you, whichever you would find,"
8279,"One among us seven will let you move ahead,"
8280,"Another will transport the drinker back instead,"
8281,"Two among our number hold only nettle wine,"
8282,"Three of us are killers, waiting hidden in line."
8283,"Choose, unless you wish to stay here forevermore,"
8284,"To help you in your choice, we give you these clues four:"
8285,"First, however slyly the poison tries to hide"
8286,You will always find some on nettle wine’s left side;
8287,"Second, different are those who stand at either end,"
8288,"But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;"
8289,"Third, as you see clearly, all are different size,"
8290,Neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides;
8291,"Fourth, the second left and the second on the right"
8292,"Are twins once you taste them, though different at first sight."
8293,"Hermione let out a great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was"
8294,"smiling, the very last thing he felt like doing."
8295,"“Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn’t magic — it’s logic — a"
8296,"puzzle. A lot of the greatest wizards haven’t got an ounce of logic,"
8297,they’d be stuck in here forever.”
8298,"“But so will we, won’t we?”"
8299,  285  
8300,CHAPTER SIXTEEN
8301,"“Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here on"
8302,this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will
8303,"get us safely through the black fire, and one will get us back"
8304,through the purple.”
8305,“But how do we know which to drink?”
8306,“Give me a minute.”
8307,Hermione read the paper several times. Then she walked up and
8308,"down the line of bottles, muttering to herself and pointing at them."
8309,"At last, she clapped her hands."
8310,"“Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through the"
8311,black fire — toward the Stone.”
8312,Harry looked at the tiny bottle.
8313,"“There’s only enough there for one of us,” he said. “That’s hardly"
8314,one swallow.”
8315,They looked at each other.
8316,“Which one will get you back through the purple flames?”
8317,Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the
8318,line.
8319,"“You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron."
8320,"Grab brooms from the flying-key room, they’ll get you out of the"
8321,trapdoor and past Fluffy — go straight to the owlery and send
8322,"Hedwig to Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able to hold"
8323,"Snape off for a while, but I’m no match for him, really.”"
8324,“But Harry — what if You-Know-Who’s with him?”
8325,"“Well — I was lucky once, wasn’t I?” said Harry, pointing at his"
8326,scar. “I might get lucky again.”
8327,"Hermione’s lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Harry and"
8328,threw her arms around him.
8329,  286 
8330,THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR
8331,“Hermione!”
8332,"“Harry — you’re a great wizard, you know.”"
8333,"“I’m not as good as you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, as she let"
8334,go of him.
8335,“Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more
8336,important things — friendship and bravery and — oh Harry —
8337,be careful !”
8338,"“You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren’t"
8339,you?”
8340,"“Positive,” said Hermione. She took a long drink from the"
8341,"round bottle at the end, and shuddered."
8342,“It’s not poison?” said Harry anxiously.
8343,“No — but it’s like ice.”
8344,"“Quick, go, before it wears off.”"
8345,“Good luck — take care —”
8346,“GO!”
8347,Hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire.
8348,Harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle. He
8349,turned to face the black flames.
8350,"“Here I come,” he said, and he drained the little bottle in one"
8351,gulp.
8352,It was indeed as though ice was flooding his body. He put the
8353,"bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw the black"
8354,"flames licking his body, but couldn’t feel them — for a moment he"
8355,"could see nothing but dark fire — then he was on the other side, in"
8356,the last chamber.
8357,There was already someone there — but it wasn’t Snape. It
8358,wasn’t even Voldemort.

8363,I    t was Quirrell.
8364,“You!” gasped Harry.
8365,Quirrell smiled. His face wasn’t twitching at all.
8366,"“Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I’d be meeting you"
8367,"here, Potter.”"
8368,“But I thought — Snape —”
8369,"“Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn’t his usual quivering"
8370,"treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem the type,"
8371,doesn’t he? So useful to have him swooping around like an over-
8372,"grown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering"
8373,P-Professor Quirrell?”
8374,"Harry couldn’t take it in. This couldn’t be true, it couldn’t."
8375,“But Snape tried to kill me!”
8376,"“No, no, no. I tried to kill you. Your friend Miss Granger acci-"

8378,Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact with you. Another

8382,few seconds and I’d have got you off that broom. I’d have managed
8383,"it before then if Snape hadn’t been muttering a countercurse, try-"
8384,ing to save you.”
8385,“Snape was trying to save me?”
8386,"“Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted"
8387,to referee your next match? He was trying to make sure I didn’t
8388,"do it again. Funny, really . . . he needn’t have bothered. I couldn’t"
8389,do anything with Dumbledore watching. All the other teachers
8390,"thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning, he did"
8391,"make himself unpopular . . . and what a waste of time, when after"
8392,"all that, I’m going to kill you tonight.”"
8393,Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of thin air and
8394,wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.
8395,"“You’re too nosy to live, Potter. Scurrying around the school on"
8396,"Halloween like that, for all I knew you’d seen me coming to look at"
8397,what was guarding the Stone.”
8398,“You let the troll in?”
8399,“Certainly. I have a special gift with trolls — you must have seen
8400,"what I did to the one in the chamber back there? Unfortunately,"
8401,"while everyone else was running around looking for it, Snape,"
8402,"who already suspected me, went straight to the third floor to head"
8403,"me off — and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death, that"
8404,three-headed dog didn’t even manage to bite Snape’s leg off
8405,properly.
8406,"“Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need to examine this interesting"
8407,mirror.”
8408,It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind
8409,Quirrell. It was the Mirror of Erised.
8410,"“This mirror is the key to finding the Stone,” Quirrell mur-"

8413,"mured, tapping his way around the frame. “Trust Dumbledore to"
8414,come up with something like this . . . but he’s in London . . . I’ll be
8415,far away by the time he gets back. . . .”
8416,All Harry could think of doing was to keep Quirrell talking and
8417,stop him from concentrating on the mirror.
8418,“I saw you and Snape in the forest —” he blurted out.
8419,"“Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around the mirror to look at"
8420,"the back. “He was on to me by that time, trying to find out how far"
8421,I’d got. He suspected me all along. Tried to frighten me — as
8422,"though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort on my side. . . .”"
8423,Quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hun-
8424,grily into it.
8425,“I see the Stone . . . I’m presenting it to my master . . . but
8426,where is it?”
8427,"Harry struggled against the ropes binding him, but they didn’t"
8428,give. He had to keep Quirrell from giving his whole attention to
8429,the mirror.
8430,“But Snape always seemed to hate me so much.”
8431,"“Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was at"
8432,"Hogwarts with your father, didn’t you know? They loathed each"
8433,other. But he never wanted you dead.”
8434,"“But I heard you a few days ago, sobbing — I thought Snape"
8435,was threatening you.
8436,"For the first time, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirrell’s face."
8437,"“Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard to follow my master’s in-"
8438,structions — he is a great wizard and I am weak —”
8439,“You mean he was there in the classroom with you?” Harry
8440,gasped.
8441, 290    
8442,THE MAN
8443,WITH TWO FACES
8444,"“He is with me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met"
8445,him when I traveled around the world. A foolish young man I was
8446,"then, full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil. Lord Voldemort"
8447,"showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there"
8448,"is only power, and those too weak to seek it. . . . Since then, I"
8449,"have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many"
8450,times. He has had to be very hard on me.” Quirrell shivered sud-
8451,denly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed to
8452,"steal the Stone from Gringotts, he was most displeased. He pun-"
8453,ished me . . . decided he would have to keep a closer watch on
8454,me. . . .”
8455,Quirrell’s voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip to
8456,Diagon Alley — how could he have been so stupid? He’d seen
8457,"Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky"
8458,Cauldron.
8459,Quirrell cursed under his breath.
8460,“I don’t understand . . . is the Stone inside the mirror? Should I
8461,break it?”
8462,Harry’s mind was racing.
8463,"What I want more than anything else in the world at the moment,"
8464,"he thought, is to find the Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look in"
8465,"the mirror, I should see myself finding it — which means I’ll see where"
8466,it’s hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I’m
8467,up to?
8468,"He tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without"
8469,"Quirrell noticing, but the ropes around his ankles were too tight:"
8470,he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking
8471,to himself.
8472,  291  
8473,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
8474,"“What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me,"
8475,Master!”
8476,"And to Harry’s horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to"
8477,come from Quirrell himself.
8478,“Use the boy . . . Use the boy . . .”
8479,Quirrell rounded on Harry.
8480,“Yes — Potter — come here.”
8481,"He clapped his hands once, and the ropes binding Harry fell off."
8482,Harry got slowly to his feet.
8483,"“Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look in the mirror and tell me"
8484,what you see.”
8485,Harry walked toward him.
8486,"I must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what"
8487,"I see, that’s all."
8488,Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny
8489,smell that seemed to come from Quirrell’s turban. He closed his
8490,"eyes, stepped in front of the mirror, and opened them again."
8491,"He saw his reflection, pale and scared-looking at first. But a mo-"
8492,"ment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its"
8493,pocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the
8494,"Stone back in its pocket — and as it did so, Harry felt something"
8495,heavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow — incredibly — he’d
8496,gotten the Stone.
8497,“Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”
8498,Harry screwed up his courage.
8499,"“I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore,” he invented."
8500,“I — I’ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.”
8501,Quirrell cursed again.
8502, 292    
8503,THE MAN
8504,WITH TWO FACES
8505,"“Get out of the way,” he said. As Harry moved aside, he felt the"
8506,Sorcerer’s Stone against his leg. Dare he make a break for it?
8507,"But he hadn’t walked five paces before a high voice spoke,"
8508,though Quirrell wasn’t moving his lips.
8509,“He lies . . . He lies . . .”
8510,"“Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me the truth!"
8511,What did you just see?”
8512,The high voice spoke again.
8513,“Let me speak to him . . . face-to-face. . . .”
8514,"“Master, you are not strong enough!”"
8515,“I have strength enough . . . for this. . . .”
8516,Harry felt as if Devil’s Snare was rooting him to the spot. He
8517,"couldn’t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached"
8518,up and began to unwrap his turban. What was going on? The tur-
8519,ban fell away. Quirrell’s head looked strangely small without it.
8520,Then he turned slowly on the spot.
8521,"Harry would have screamed, but he couldn’t make a sound."
8522,"Where there should have been a back to Quirrell’s head, there was"
8523,"a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white"
8524,"with glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake."
8525,“Harry Potter . . .” it whispered.
8526,Harry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn’t move.
8527,“See what I have become?” the face said. “Mere shadow and va-
8528,por . . . I have form only when I can share another’s body . . . but
8529,there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts
8530,"and minds. . . . Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past"

8535,body of my own. . . . Now . . . why don’t you give me that Stone in
8536,your pocket?”
8537,So he knew. The feeling suddenly surged back into Harry’s legs.
8538,He stumbled backward.
8539,"“Don’t be a fool,” snarled the face. “Better save your own life and"
8540,join me . . . or you’ll meet the same end as your parents. . . . They
8541,died begging me for mercy. . . .”
8542,“LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.
8543,"Quirrell was walking backward at him, so that Voldemort could"
8544,still see him. The evil face was now smiling.
8545,"“How touching . . .” it hissed. “I always value bravery. . . . Yes,"
8546,"boy, your parents were brave. . . . I killed your father first, and"
8547,he put up a courageous fight . . . but your mother needn’t have
8548,"died . . . she was trying to protect you. . . . Now give me the Stone,"
8549,unless you want her to have died in vain.”
8550,“NEVER!”
8551,"Harry sprang toward the flame door, but Voldemort screamed"
8552,"“SEIZE HIM!” and the next second, Harry felt Quirrell’s hand"
8553,"close on his wrist. At once, a needle-sharp pain seared across"
8554,Harry’s scar; his head felt as though it was about to split in two; he
8555,"yelled, struggling with all his might, and to his surprise, Quirrell let"
8556,go of him. The pain in his head lessened — he looked around
8557,"wildly to see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched in"
8558,"pain, looking at his fingers — they were blistering before his eyes."
8559,"“Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quir-"
8560,"rell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing on top of"
8561,"him, both hands around Harry’s neck — Harry’s scar was almost"
8562,"blinding him with pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling in agony."
8563, 294   
8564,THE MAN
8565,WITH TWO FACES
8566,"“Master, I cannot hold him — my hands — my hands!”"
8567,"And Quirrell, though pinning Harry to the ground with his"
8568,"knees, let go of his neck and stared, bewildered, at his own"
8569,"palms — Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny."
8570,"“Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort."
8571,"Quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse, but Harry, by"
8572,"instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell’s face —"
8573,“AAAARGH!”
8574,"Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry"
8575,"knew: Quirrell couldn’t touch his bare skin, not without suffering"
8576,"terrible pain — his only chance was to keep hold of Quirrell, keep"
8577,him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse.
8578,"Harry jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by the arm, and hung"
8579,on as tight as he could. Quirrell screamed and tried to throw Harry
8580,off — the pain in Harry’s head was building — he couldn’t see —
8581,he could only hear Quirrell’s terrible shrieks and Voldemort’s yells
8582,"of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe in Harry’s"
8583,"own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”"
8584,"He felt Quirrell’s arm wrenched from his grasp, knew all was"
8585,"lost, and fell into blackness, down . . . down . . . down . . ."
8586,Something gold was glinting just above him. The Snitch! He tried
8587,"to catch it, but his arms were too heavy."
8588,He blinked. It wasn’t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses.
8589,How strange.
8590,He blinked again. The smiling face of Albus Dumbledore swam
8591,into view above him.
8592,"“Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore."
8593, 295  
8594,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
8595,Harry stared at him. Then he remembered: “Sir! The Stone! It
8596,"was Quirrell! He’s got the Stone! Sir, quick —”"
8597,"“Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a little behind the times,” said"
8598,Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have the Stone.”
8599,"“Then who does? Sir, I —”"
8600,"“Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown"
8601,out.”
8602,Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must
8603,be in the hospital wing. He was lying in a bed with white linen
8604,"sheets, and next to him was a table piled high with what looked like"
8605,half the candy shop.
8606,"“Tokens from your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore,"
8607,beaming. “What happened down in the dungeons between you
8608,"and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole"
8609,school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George
8610,Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat. No
8611,"doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, how-"
8612,"ever, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”"
8613,“How long have I been in here?”
8614,“Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be
8615,"most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely"
8616,worried.”
8617,"“But sir, the Stone —”"
8618,"“I see you are not to be distracted. Very well, the Stone. Profes-"
8619,sor Quirrell did not manage to take it from you. I arrived in time
8620,"to prevent that, although you were doing very well on your own, I"

8626,“We must have crossed in midair. No sooner had I reached Lon-

8628,one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you —”
8629,“It was you.”
8630,“I feared I might be too late.”
8631,"“You nearly were, I couldn’t have kept him off the Stone much"
8632,longer —”
8633,"“Not the Stone, boy, you — the effort involved nearly killed"
8634,"you. For one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. As for the"
8635,"Stone, it has been destroyed.”"
8636,“Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend — Nicolas
8637,Flamel —”
8638,"“Oh, you know about Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding"
8639,"quite delighted. “You did do the thing properly, didn’t you? Well,"
8640,"Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it’s all for the"
8641,best.”
8642,"“But that means he and his wife will die, won’t they?”"
8643,“They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and
8644,"then, yes, they will die.”"
8645,Dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on Harry’s face.
8646,"“To one as young as you, I’m sure it seems incredible, but to"
8647,"Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very"
8648,"long day. After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the"
8649,"next great adventure. You know, the Stone was really not such a"
8650,wonderful thing. As much money and life as you could want! The
8651,two things most human beings would choose above all — the trou-

8656,"Harry lay there, lost for words. Dumbledore hummed a little"
8657,and smiled at the ceiling.
8658,“Sir?” said Harry. “I’ve been thinking . . . Sir — even if the
8659,"Stone’s gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know-Who —”"
8660,"“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for"
8661,things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”
8662,"“Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort’s going to try other ways of coming"
8663,"back, isn’t he? I mean, he hasn’t gone, has he?”"
8664,"“No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps"
8665,"looking for another body to share . . . not being truly alive, he can-"
8666,not be killed. He left Quirrell to die; he shows just as little mercy
8667,"to his followers as his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may"
8668,"only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone"
8669,else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next
8670,"time — and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never re-"
8671,turn to power.”
8672,"Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head"
8673,"hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I’d like to"
8674,"know, if you can tell me . . . things I want to know the truth"
8675,about. . . .”
8676,“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible
8677,"thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. How-"
8678,"ever, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good rea-"
8679,"son not to, in which case I beg you’ll forgive me. I shall not, of"

8681,“Well . . . Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because

8687,Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
8688,"“Alas, the first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today."
8689,"Not now. You will know, one day . . . put it from your mind for"
8690,"now, Harry. When you are older . . . I know you hate to hear"
8691,"this . . . when you are ready, you will know.”"
8692,And Harry knew it would be no good to argue.
8693,“But why couldn’t Quirrell touch me?”
8694,“Your mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort
8695,"cannot understand, it is love. He didn’t realize that love as power-"
8696,"ful as your mother’s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no"
8697,"visible sign . . . to have been loved so deeply, even though the per-"
8698,"son who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is"
8699,"in your very skin. Quirrell, full of hatred, greed, and ambition,"
8700,"sharing his soul with Voldemort, could not touch you for this rea-"
8701,son. It was agony to touch a person marked by something so
8702,good.”
8703,Dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the
8704,"windowsill, which gave Harry time to dry his eyes on the sheet."
8705,"When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And the Invisi-"

8707,"“Ah — your father happened to leave it in my possession, and I"
8708,thought you might like it.” Dumbledore’s eyes twinkled. “Useful
8709,things . . . your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the
8710,kitchens to steal food when he was here.”
8711,“And there’s something else . . .”
8712,“Fire away.”

8719,"“Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and"

8722,“What?”
8723,“He saved his life.”
8724,“What?”
8725,"“Yes . . .” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, the way people’s"

8727,ther’s debt. . . . I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this
8728,year because he felt that would make him and your father even.
8729,Then he could go back to hating your father’s memory in

8731,"Harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound, so he"
8732,stopped.
8733,"“And sir, there’s one more thing . . .”"
8734,“Just the one?”
8735,“How did I get the Stone out of the mirror?”
8736,"“Ah, now, I’m glad you asked me that. It was one of my more"
8737,"brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that’s saying something."
8738,"You see, only one who wanted to find the Stone — find it, but not"

8745,"them — but I think I’ll be safe with a nice toffee, don’t you?”"

8747,THE MAN
8748,WITH TWO FACES
8749,He smiled and popped the golden-brown bean into his mouth.
8750,"Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”"
8751,"Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, was a nice woman, but very strict."
8752,"“Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded."
8753,“Absolutely not.”
8754,“You let Professor Dumbledore in. . . .”
8755,"“Well, of course, that was the headmaster, quite different. You"
8756,need rest.”
8757,"“I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on,"
8758,Madam Pomfrey . . .”
8759,"“Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”"
8760,And she let Ron and Hermione in.
8761,“Harry!”
8762,"Hermione looked ready to fling her arms around him again, but"
8763,Harry was glad she held herself in as his head was still very sore.
8764,"“Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to — Dumbledore"
8765,was so worried —”
8766,"“The whole school’s talking about it,” said Ron. “What really"
8767,happened?”
8768,It was one of those rare occasions when the true story is even
8769,more strange and exciting than the wild rumors. Harry told them
8770,everything: Quirrell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemort. Ron
8771,and Hermione were a very good audience; they gasped in all the
8772,"right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell’s"
8773,"turban, Hermione screamed out loud."
8774,“So the Stone’s gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel’s just going to
8775,die?”
8776,"“That’s what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that — what was"
8777, 301  
8778,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
8779,"it? — ‘to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great ad-"
8780,venture.’ ”
8781,"“I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite im-"
8782,pressed at how crazy his hero was.
8783,“So what happened to you two?” said Harry.
8784,"“Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron"
8785,round — that took a while — and we were dashing up to the
8786,owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance
8787,"hall — he already knew — he just said, ‘Harry’s gone after him,"
8788,hasn’t he?’ and hurtled off to the third floor.”
8789,“D’you think he meant you to do it?” said Ron. “Sending you
8790,your fathers cloak and everything?”
8791,"“Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did — I mean to say — that’s"
8792,terrible — you could have been killed.”
8793,"“No, it isn’t,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’s a funny man, Dum-"
8794,bledore. I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance. I think he
8795,"knows more or less everything that goes on here, you know. I"
8796,"reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try, and instead"
8797,"of stopping us, he just taught us enough to help. I don’t think it"
8798,was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked. It’s al-
8799,most like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I
8800,could. . . .”
8801,"“Yeah, Dumbledore’s off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly."
8802,"“Listen, you’ve got to be up for the end-of-year feast tomorrow."
8803,"The points are all in and Slytherin won, of course — you missed"
8804,"the last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw"
8805,without you — but the food’ll be good.”
8806,"At that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over."
8807,"“You’ve had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she said firmly."

8811,       
8812,"After a good night’s sleep, Harry felt nearly back to normal."
8813,"“I want to go to the feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey as she"
8814,"straightened his many candy boxes. “I can, can’t I?”"
8815,"“Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go,” she said"
8816,"sniffily, as though in her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn’t"
8817,realize how risky feasts could be. “And you have another visitor.”
8818,"“Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”"
8819,Hagrid sidled through the door as he spoke. As usual when he
8820,"was indoors, Hagrid looked too big to be allowed. He sat down"
8821,"next to Harry, took one look at him, and burst into tears."
8822,"“It’s — all — my — ruddy — fault!” he sobbed, his face in his"
8823,hands. “I told the evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was
8824,"the only thing he didn’t know, an’ I told him! Yeh could’ve died! All"
8825,fer a dragon egg! I’ll never drink again! I should be chucked out an’
8826,made ter live as a Muggle!”
8827,"“Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking with grief"
8828,"and remorse, great tears leaking down into his beard. “Hagrid, he’d"
8829,"have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we’re talking about,"
8830,he’d have found out even if you hadn’t told him.”
8831,“Yeh could’ve died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An’ don’ say the name!”
8832,"“VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked,"
8833,he stopped crying. “I’ve met him and I’m calling him by his name.
8834,"Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it’s gone, he can’t use"
8835,"it. Have a Chocolate Frog, I’ve got loads. . . .”"
8836,"Hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said, “That"
8837,reminds me. I’ve got yeh a present.”
8838,"“It’s not a stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and at last"
8839,Hagrid gave a weak chuckle.
8840,  303   
8841,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
8842,“Nah. Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it.
8843,"’Course, he shoulda sacked me instead — anyway, got yeh this . . .”"
8844,"It seemed to be a handsome, leather-covered book. Harry opened"
8845,it curiously. It was full of wizard photographs. Smiling and waving
8846,at him from every page were his mother and father.
8847,"“Sent owls off ter all yer parents’ old school friends, askin’ fer"
8848,photos . . . knew yeh didn’ have any . . . d’yeh like it?”
8849,"Harry couldn’t speak, but Hagrid understood."
8850,Harry made his way down to the end-of-year feast alone that night.
8851,"He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey’s fussing about, insisting"
8852,"on giving him one last checkup, so the Great Hall was already full."
8853,It was decked out in the Slytherin colors of green and silver to cel-
8854,ebrate Slytherin’s winning the House Cup for the seventh year in a
8855,row. A huge banner showing the Slytherin serpent covered the wall
8856,behind the High Table.
8857,"When Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then"
8858,everybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat be-
8859,tween Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ig-
8860,nore the fact that people were standing up to look at him.
8861,"Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble"
8862,died away.
8863,“Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must
8864,trouble you with an old man’s wheezing waffle before we sink our
8865,teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been! Hopefully
8866,your heads are all a little fuller than they were . . . you have the
8867,whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year
8868,starts. . . .
8869,  304  
8870,THE MAN
8871,WITH TWO FACES
8872,"“Now, as I understand it, the House Cup here needs awarding,"
8873,"and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with three"
8874,"hundred and twelve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with three hun-"
8875,dred and fifty-two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty-six and
8876,"Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”"
8877,A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Slytherin
8878,table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet on the
8879,table. It was a sickening sight.
8880,"“Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, re-"
8881,cent events must be taken into account.”
8882,The room went very still. The Slytherins’ smiles faded a little.
8883,"“Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have a few last-minute points to"
8884,dish out. Let me see. Yes . . .
8885,“First — to Mr. Ronald Weasley . . .”
8886,Ron went purple in the face; he looked like a radish with a bad
8887,sunburn.
8888,“. . . for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in
8889,"many years, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”"
8890,Gryffindor cheers nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; the stars
8891,overhead seemed to quiver. Percy could be heard telling the other
8892,"prefects, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past"
8893,McGonagall’s giant chess set!”
8894,At last there was silence again.
8895,“Second — to Miss Hermione Granger . . . for the use of cool
8896,"logic in the face of fire, I award Gryffindor House fifty points.”"
8897,Hermione buried her face in her arms; Harry strongly suspected
8898,she had burst into tears. Gryffindors up and down the table were
8899,beside themselves — they were a hundred points up.
8900, 305  
8901,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
8902,“Third — to Mr. Harry Potter . . .” said Dumbledore. The room
8903,"went deadly quiet. “. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I"
8904,award Gryffindor House sixty points.”
8905,The din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling
8906,themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred
8907,and seventy-two points — exactly the same as Slytherin. They had
8908,tied for the House Cup — if only Dumbledore had given Harry just
8909,one more point.
8910,Dumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent.
8911,"“There are all kinds of courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It"
8912,"takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as"
8913,much to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to
8914,Mr. Neville Longbottom.”
8915,Someone standing outside the Great Hall might well have
8916,"thought some sort of explosion had taken place, so loud was the"
8917,"noise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and"
8918,"Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock,"
8919,disappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won
8920,"so much as a point for Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering,"
8921,"nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed at Malfoy, who couldn’t have"
8922,looked more stunned and horrified if he’d just had the Body-Bind
8923,Curse put on him.
8924,"“Which means,” Dumbledore called over the storm of applause,"
8925,for even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall
8926,"of Slytherin, “we need a little change of decoration.”"
8927,"He clapped his hands. In an instant, the green hangings became"
8928,scarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent van-
8929,ished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was

8931,THE MAN
8932,WITH TWO FACES
8933,"shaking Professor McGonagall’s hand, with a horrible, forced"
8934,smile. He caught Harry’s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape’s
8935,feelings toward him hadn’t changed one jot. This didn’t worry
8936,"Harry. It seemed as though life would be back to normal next year,"
8937,or as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
8938,"It was the best evening of Harry’s life, better than winning at"
8939,"Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls . . . he"
8940,"would never, ever forget tonight."
8941,Harry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to
8942,"come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron"
8943,"passed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades"
8944,"of the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbol-"
8945,ogy mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped
8946,"that Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be"
8947,"thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron"
8948,"said, you couldn’t have everything in life."
8949,"And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were"
8950,"packed, Neville’s toad was found lurking in a corner of the toilets;"
8951,"notes were handed out to all students, warning them not to use"
8952,magic over the holidays (“I always hope they’ll forget to give us
8953,"these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them"
8954,down to the fleet of boats that sailed across the lake; they were
8955,boarding the Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing as the coun-
8956,tryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor
8957,Beans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard
8958,robes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine
8959,and three-quarters at King’s Cross station.
8960, 307  
8961,CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
8962,It took quite a while for them all to get off the platform. A wiz-
8963,"ened old guard was up by the ticket barrier, letting them go"
8964,through the gate in twos and threes so they didn’t attract atten-
8965,tion by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the
8966,Muggles.
8967,"“You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both of"
8968,you — I’ll send you an owl.”
8969,"“Thanks,” said Harry, “I’ll need something to look forward to.”"
8970,People jostled them as they moved forward toward the gateway
8971,back to the Muggle world. Some of them called:
8972,"“Bye, Harry!”"
8973,"“See you, Potter!”"
8974,"“Still famous,” said Ron, grinning at him."
8975,"“Not where I’m going, I promise you,” said Harry."
8976,"He, Ron, and Hermione passed through the gateway together."
8977,"“There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”"
8978,"It was Ginny Weasley, Ron’s younger sister, but she wasn’t point-"
8979,ing at Ron.
8980,"“Harry Potter!” she squealed. “Look, Mom! I can see —”"
8981,"“Be quiet, Ginny, and it’s rude to point.”"
8982,Mrs. Weasley smiled down at them.
8983,“Busy year?” she said.
8984,"“Very,” said Harry. “Thanks for the fudge and the sweater, Mrs."
8985,Weasley.”
8986,"“Oh, it was nothing, dear.”"
8987,"“Ready, are you?”"
8988,"It was Uncle Vernon, still purple-faced, still mustached, still"

8994,"and Dudley, looking terrified at the very sight of Harry."
8995,“You must be Harry’s family!” said Mrs. Weasley.
8996,"“In a manner of speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy,"
8997,we haven’t got all day.” He walked away.
8998,Harry hung back for a last word with Ron and Hermione.
8999,"“See you over the summer, then.”"

9001,"ing uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be"
9002,so unpleasant.
9003,"“Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised at the grin that"
9004,was spreading over his face. “They don’t know we’re not allowed to
9005,use magic at home. I’m going to have a lot of fun with Dudley this
9006,summer. . . .”
